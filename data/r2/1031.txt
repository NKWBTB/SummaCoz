Article:
Santner, 24, broke his finger in only his second game for the county in 2016.
"There is some unfinished business with Mitch," director of cricket Steve Rhodes told Worcestershire's website.
"Last summer he was very unlucky. Losing Mitch was a massive blow to our hopes of qualifying. We'd had a good start and him playing all those games would have been an extra bonus for us."
The left-arm batsman and spinner, who made his Test debut in 2015, will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England.
Santner added: "I really enjoyed my time at Worcester with a great bunch of lads and it was so frustrating for me to pick up that injury in the very first T20 game.
"It's fantastic that I've got the chance to come back again next summer and hopefully I can make up for lost time and make an impact with bat and ball."
In August, Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game.

Summary:
worcestershire have re-signed south africa all-rounder mitch santner for this summer\'s t20 blast.

GPT4:
1. Nationality Mismatch: The summary states that Mitch Santner is a South Africa all-rounder, but the article does not mention his nationality. However, Mitch Santner is a well-known New Zealand cricketer, not South African. This is a factual error and is inconsistent with common knowledge about the player.

2. Injury Details: The summary does not mention Santner's injury, which is a significant part of the article. The article explains that Santner broke his finger in his second game for the county in 2016, which led to him missing games. This detail is relevant to the context of his re-signing and the "unfinished business" mentioned by the director of cricket, Steve Rhodes.

3. Specific Tournament: The summary refers to Santner being re-signed for "this summer's T20 Blast," but the article specifies that he will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England. While it is implied that he will be available for the T20 Blast, the article does not explicitly state this, and the summary should reflect the information given.

4. Context of Previous Stint: The article provides context about Santner's previous stint with Worcestershire, including the impact of his injury on the team's performance and his personal frustration. The summary does not capture this context, which is important for understanding the significance of his return to the team.

5. Additional Signing: The article mentions the signing of Australian pace bowler John Hastings as Worcestershire's main overseas player for the 2017 season. While this may not be directly related to Santner's re-signing, it is part of the team's overall strategy and player acquisitions, which the summary completely omits.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states Santner's nationality, omits details about his injury and the context of his previous stint with Worcestershire, and does not accurately reflect the timing and nature of his re-signing with the team.
