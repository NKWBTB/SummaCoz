GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban." This is consistent with the article, which mentions that Spahic could face a ban after video footage emerged showing him in an altercation with stewards.

2. The summary also mentions that "video footage shows him fighting and aiming a headbutt at stewards." This is consistent with the article, which describes the footage of Spahic appearing to fight with stewards and aiming a headbutt at a member of stadium staff.

3. The summary states that "Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury." This is where the inconsistency lies.

Instead, it describes his involvement in the match and the altercation that took place after the game.
