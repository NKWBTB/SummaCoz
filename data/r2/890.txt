GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Carwyn Scott-Howell fell to his death while skiing in Flaine, France." This statement is consistent with the article, which describes how Carwyn became separated from his family and fell over a 164ft drop in the French Alps.

2. The summary then claims that "his mother, Ceri, nine, and brother Gerwyn, 19, also died in woodland." This statement is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention the deaths of any other family members. It only describes the efforts of Carwyn's mother, Cari, to find her missing son and the family's devastation after Carwyn's death.

3. The summary includes a quote that the family described how he "`made life full of laughter with never a dull moment.'" This statement is consistent with the article, which includes a similar tribute from the family, saying Carwyn "`made life full of laughter with never a dull moment.'"

4. Lastly, the summary states that "Carwyn, from Talybont-on-Usk in Wales, was a `very competent skier and snowboarder.'" This statement is consistent with the article, which mentions that Carwyn was said to have been a "very competent skier and snowboarder" who had started skiing at the age of three.

In conclusion, the inconsistency in the summary is the claim that Carwyn's mother and brother also died. The article only reports the tragic death of Carwyn and does not mention any other family members dying in the incident.
