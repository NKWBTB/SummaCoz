Summary:
a man accused of causing the death of a six-year-old girl in a car crash has been jailed for six years.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses a court case involving Brian Wright, who is accused of causing serious injury to Sylvia Blackburn, not the death of a six-year-old girl. The summary incorrectly states the victim of the crash was a six-year-old girl.

2. The article does not mention that Brian Wright has been jailed, as the summary claims. Instead, it indicates that the trial is ongoing with the phrase "The trial continues."

3. The article specifies that Sylvia Blackburn is a 72-year-old lollipop lady who suffered serious head injuries and is now being treated in residential care. There is no mention of a fatality or a child victim in the article.

4. The article describes an incident where Mrs. Blackburn was escorting a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road when she was struck by Mr. Wright's vehicle. The child is not mentioned as a victim of the crash, only Mrs. Blackburn is.

5. The summary's claim that the man has been jailed for six years is inconsistent with the information provided in the article, which does not report a conviction or sentencing.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately identifies the victim and the outcome of the court proceedings. The article is about an injury to an adult woman, not the death of a child, and the trial has not yet concluded with a sentencing.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a man accused of causing the death of a six-year-old girl in a car crash has been jailed for six years.
2. However, the article states that Brian Wright, the accused, has not been jailed at the time of the article. He is on trial for causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The article mentions that Sylvia Blackburn, the victim, suffered serious head injuries but does not mention her death or the death of a six-year-old girl.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces incorrect information about the accused being jailed and the death of a six-year-old girl, which is not supported by the article.
