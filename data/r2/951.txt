Article:
(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: "Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival." He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to "reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred." What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.

Summary:
falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called dragon on a flight from cape canaveral . the two-stage two-stage falcon rocket landed on the drone ship in january . the rocket was the attempt to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time . the company has said it will keep trying to land rocket on the ground .

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "the two-stage Falcon rocket landed on the drone ship in January." This is inconsistent with the article, which mentions that SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. Therefore, the rocket did not successfully land on the drone ship in January.

2. The summary also claims that "the rocket was the attempt to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time." This is not consistent with the article, which implies that the attempt to land on a floating barge was not the first time, as it refers to a previous attempt in January.

3. The summary suggests that the company has said it will keep trying to land the rocket on the ground. While the article does mention that SpaceX hopes to someday land rockets on the ground, it does not specifically state that the company has said it will keep trying to land on the ground as the next step. The focus is on mastering landing at sea first.

4. The summary does not mention the outcome of the most recent landing attempt described in the article, where Elon Musk tweeted that the rocket landed on the droneship but too hard for survival and that it tipped over. This is a significant detail that is missing from the summary.

5. The summary correctly states that the Falcon 9 rocket was carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, which is consistent with the article.

In conclusion, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, particularly regarding the details of the rocket landing attempts and the history of those attempts.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the Falcon 9 rocket landed on a floating barge, while the article states that the rocket landed on a drone ship but tipped over and exploded. This is the main inconsistency between the two.
