Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also knownÂ as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

Summary:
lady gaga and lourdes leon have been wearing the body jewellery . in nepal tribes , it was used in an war paint to paint their nose . the septum ring is also used as a nose stud .

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Lady Gaga and Lourdes Leon have been wearing the body jewellery." The article does mention Lady Gaga adopting the trend, but it does not mention Lourdes Leon wearing septum jewelry. This is the first inconsistency.

2. The summary claims that "in Nepal tribes, it was used in war paint to paint their nose." The article does not mention anything about Nepalese tribes using septum rings as war paint or painting their noses. It does, however, mention that in Nepal, the septum ring is often used as a status symbol. This is the second inconsistency.

3. The summary mentions that "the septum ring is also used as a nose stud." This is misleading because the article differentiates between the septum piercing and the nose stud. It states that in India and Bangladesh, septum piercings are popular and that the practice of wearing a septum ring to show marital status is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. The summary incorrectly suggests that the septum ring itself is used as a nose stud, which is a different type of piercing. This is the third inconsistency.

In conclusion, the summary contains several inaccuracies and misrepresentations of the information provided in the article, making it inconsistent with the original text.
