Article:
(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for "Barbara," left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the "warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions." Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited "three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales," which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. "For her to go to Mexico," Mate said, "It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from." Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to "navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive," he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. "Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look," Mate said. Fourth baby orca born this season .

Summary:
Varvara traveled 14,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean. (Hat tip: The Daily Beast)

GPT4:
1. The article is from CNN, not The Daily Beast. The summary incorrectly attributes the source of the information to The Daily Beast when it should be CNN.

2. The article provides detailed information about Varvara's migration, including the distance traveled (nearly 14,000 miles or 22,500 kilometers), her starting point (off Russia's Sakhalin Island), her route (across the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico), and the significance of her journey. The summary only mentions the distance and the fact that she traveled across the Pacific Ocean, omitting other important details.

3. The article discusses the significance of Varvara's journey in terms of scientific research and what it might indicate about the classification of western and eastern gray whales. The summary does not mention any of this context.

4. The article mentions that Varvara's journey surpassed the previous record for the longest mammal migration listed on the Guinness World Records website. The summary does not include this fact.

5. The article includes quotes and insights from Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study and director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. The summary does not reference any of his contributions or statements.

6. The article concludes with a mention of a fourth baby orca being born this season, which is unrelated to the main story about Varvara. The summary does not mention this, which is appropriate since it is not relevant to the main topic.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the incorrect attribution of the source of the information to The Daily Beast instead of CNN, and the omission of key details and context provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary does not provide any additional information or context beyond the distance traveled.
2. The article provides information about Varvara's journey, including her route and the fact that she visited three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales.
3. The summary does not mention any of this additional information.
