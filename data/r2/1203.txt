Article:
They started arriving at Poldhu Cove on the Lizard on Sunday, and National Trust volunteers have been clearing them away as they are said to pose a risk to wildlife.
The bottles are sealed, but witnesses say some have leaked.
The National Trust said it believed a container had gone overboard from a ship, during the stormy weather.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: "While it is fact that the MV Blue Ocean lost a container containing bottles of 'Vanish', there is no currently available evidence that the bottles washed up on the Cornish coast are from this container; all evidence is currently circumstantial."
It is thought the vessel lost the container near Land's End in May.
The BBC has contacted Vanish, but the company is yet to comment.
Other nearby coves including Gunwalloe, Polurrian, Church Cove and Marazion have also been affected, conservationists said.
Cornwall Wildlife Trust said it was "highly concerned" about the impact on "sensitive marine life".
Justin Whitehouse, from the National Trust, said: "The main worry is all that detergent going into our beautiful marine environment, but thankfully most are full.
"We think it's a container that has gone overboard from a container ship, during stormy seas."
Cornwall Council said the authority and partners, including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Natural England, would be monitoring beaches in the area.
It said: "The National Trust who own the beach at Poldhu have arranged for the bottles to be cleared away.
"In the meantime the public are advised to keep children and dogs at a safe distance from the bottles should any more be washed up.
"No attempt should be made to recover the bottles."

Summary:
a container ship has washed up on a cornish beach, leaving two dead and three others injured.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is evident when we compare the details provided in the article with the claims made in the summary. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The article mentions that bottles, believed to be from a container that went overboard from a ship, have washed up on Poldhu Cove on the Lizard and other nearby coves. There is no mention of an entire container ship washing up on the beach.

2. The article states that National Trust volunteers have been clearing away the bottles because they pose a risk to wildlife. There is no mention of any human casualties or injuries related to the incident.

3. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is quoted as saying that there is no currently available evidence that the bottles are from the container lost by the MV Blue Ocean, indicating that the situation is still under investigation and the origin of the bottles is based on circumstantial evidence.

4. The article does not report any deaths or injuries. It focuses on the environmental concerns and the cleanup efforts by various organizations.

5. The summary's claim that "a container ship has washed up on a cornish beach, leaving two dead and three others injured" is not supported by any information in the article. The article only discusses the washing up of bottles, not a ship, and does not report any fatalities or injuries.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately describes the nature of the incident (a container ship washing up versus bottles washing up), and it falsely reports casualties that were not mentioned in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that two people died and three others were injured when a container ship washed up on a Cornish beach.

2. However, the article does not mention any deaths or injuries. Instead, it reports that a container is believed to have gone overboard from a ship during stormy weather, and that bottles of detergent have washed up on nearby beache s.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information about deaths and injuries that is not present in the article
