Article:
Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header.
Bradford dominated the rest of the opening period as the visitors' defence survived a series of narrow escapes.
Keeper Connor Ripley made a brilliant one-handed save to deny winger Mark Marshall, Timothee Dieng and Josh Cullen both had shots deflected for corners, and Billy Clarke missed a good chance when he turned James Meredith's cross wide.
Oldham somehow held their lead until half-time, but Bradford deservedly equalised after 57 minutes when Ousmane Fane dragged Cullen to the ground and Clarke scored from the spot.
Bradford continued to dominate, but could not turn possession into goals as Oldham's defence held firm.

GPT4:
1. The article provides a detailed account of a football match between Bradford City and Oldham Athletic, including events such as goals scored, attempts missed, substitutions made, and other match incidents.

2. The article mentions that Oldham went in front with a goal from Peter Clarke and that Bradford City equalized with a penalty scored by Billy Clarke. The final score, as stated at the end of the article, was Bradford City 1, Oldham Athletic 1.

3. The article does not mention the FA Cup or indicate that the match was part of the FA Cup competition. Instead, it simply reports on a match between the two teams without specifying the context of the competition.

4. The summary claims that the match was a draw in the first round of the FA Cup. This information is not supported by the article, which does not reference the FA Cup at all.

5. Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the summary's claim about the match being part of the FA Cup, which is not corroborated by any information in the article. The article only reports on a match that ended in a draw without specifying the competition.

HUMAN:
