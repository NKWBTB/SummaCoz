GPT4:
1. The article begins by mentioning that billionaire Bill Koch is putting his state-of-the-art condo on the market for $100 million. This information is consistent with the summary, which states that the property is up for sale.

2. The article describes the property as a 28-bedroom property nicknamed The Elk Mountain Lodge, which spans 82.6 acres and includes multiple cabins overlooking 'trout-soaked ponds'. This detailed description of the property is not reflected in the summary, which only mentions "numerous cozy living rooms."

3. The article provides additional information about the amenities and features of the property, such as a fitness center, indoor basketball court, humidity-controlled wine room, and numerous spas. It also mentions the location being close to cross-country ski routes and a renowned restaurant. The summary does not include any of this information.

4. The article states that the property includes 25 bathrooms, an entertainment hall, and a heated four-car garage. It also describes the luxurious nature of the cabins and the high-quality, often antique, furniture that comes with the property. Again, the summary does not mention any of these features.

5. The article notes that the property is being marketed as a private resort or business retreat, which suggests a specific use for potential buyers. The summary does not capture this aspect of the property's marketing.

6. The inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary only mentions "the numerous cozy living rooms" as being for sale, which is misleading. The entire property, which includes much more than just living rooms, is on the market. The summary fails to accurately represent the scale, luxury, and intended use of the property as described in the article. It also omits the name of the property, The Elk Mountain Lodge, which is a significant detail.

HUMAN:
1. The summary mentions the numerous cozy living rooms in bill koch's aspen retreat is up for sale.
