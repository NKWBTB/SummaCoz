A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday as part of what began with a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington. Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city. Scroll down for video Critical: A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA. The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports. The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed. According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C. The barricade caused a collision between the suspect's car and a police cruiser, NBC reports. The suspect was shot several times. Two police officers were also wounded in the showdown, but reportedly had non-life threatening injuries.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement that the shooter had barricaded himself inside the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters. The article clearly states that although there were initial reports of the shooter barricading himself inside, this was not the case. Instead, the shooter led police on a chase back into Washington, D.C., which ended with the shooter being shot on a busy street in Northeast D.C.

Here are the steps that identify the inconsistency:

1. The summary claims that "authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8 pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself inside." This suggests that the shooter was inside the building during the lockdown.

2. The article, however, clarifies that these were just reports and that the actual events differed: "However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C."

3. The article further details the chase and the eventual shooting of the suspect on a street in Northeast D.C., which confirms that the shooter was not barricaded inside the building as the summary suggests.

4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the shooter had barricaded himself inside the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters when, in fact, he had led police on a chase outside of the building.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8 pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself inside. The shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Police believe the suspect may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city.
2. However, the article states that the shooter had indeed taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. and was shot on a busy Northeast Washington street. However, there is no mention in the article that authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8 pm Thursday or that the shooter had barricaded himself inside. Additionally, the article does not provide information about the suspect being tied to another shooting in the Southeast quadrant of the city.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary introduces details about the authorities locking down the Suitland campus and the shooter barricading himself inside, which are not supported by the article.
