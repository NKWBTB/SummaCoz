Article:
The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September.
Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects.
The UK detectives will now compile a report and "update the families of Hannah and David," a spokesman said.
"Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," the Met Police said in a statement.
"They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings.
"The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit."
Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings.
Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions.
The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty.
However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation.
The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment.
The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand.
He had previously rejected offers of assistance.
Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds.
Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.

Summary:
police investigating the murders of two british tourists on the thai island of kodge are to travel to thailand, the prime minister has said.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the timing of the events described in the article versus what is stated in the summary. The summary suggests that the police are planning to travel to Thailand, indicating a future action. However, the article clearly states that the Metropolitan Police officers have already traveled to Thailand, completed their work, and are in the process of returning to the UK to compile their report. Here are the steps that identify the inconsistency:

1. The article mentions that "Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police," which indicates that the travel to Thailand has already occurred.

2. The article further states, "Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," confirming that the UK detectives have finished their work in Thailand.

3. It is also mentioned that "They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings," which indicates the next steps after their return to the UK.

4. The summary's statement that the police "are to travel to Thailand" is therefore inconsistent with the article, which clearly indicates that the travel and investigation in Thailand have already taken place.

In conclusion, the summary incorrectly suggests that the police investigation in Thailand is a future event, while the article confirms it as a past event with the police officers already planning their return to the UK.
