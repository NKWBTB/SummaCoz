Summary:
a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in dundee.

GPT4:
The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee. However, the article does not mention the age of the victim, nor does it specify that the victim was a 15-year-old girl. Instead, the article discusses the case of Clive Weatherhogg, who was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man he found through an adult website. The article also mentions that he was convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner.

Here are the steps to identify the inconsistency:

1. The summary mentions the sexual abuse of a 15-year-old girl, but the article does not provide any information about the victim's age.
2. The article refers to the victim as a woman, which implies that she is an adult, not a 15-year-old girl.
3. The article details the crimes committed by Clive Weatherhogg, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity, filming it, and sharing explicit images with her family members, not specifically mentioning any abuse of a minor.
4. The article does not mention the location of the abuse as Dundee; it only states that the trial took place at Dundee Sheriff Court.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately describes the victim as a 15-year-old girl and does not accurately reflect the crimes for which Clive Weatherhogg was convicted.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee.
2. However, the article does not mention that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. The article discusses Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister. The charges and sentences in the article are related to Clive Weatherhogg's actions, not those of a 15-year-old girl.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary' statement is not mentioned in the article.
