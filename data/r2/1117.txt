Article:
The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury.
However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected.
Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later.
He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side.
There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby.
Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy.

Summary:
scotland full-back vunipola has been ruled out of the six nations with a knee injury.

GPT4:
1. The article does not mention the position "full-back" in relation to Vunipola. Instead, it discusses his role in the team in terms of ball-carrying and dynamism, which are more typically associated with a forward, suggesting he is not a full-back.

2. The summary states that Vunipola has been "ruled out of the Six Nations with a knee injury," which is inconsistent with the article. The article indicates that Vunipola has been recovering quicker than expected from his knee injury and could be in contention to play in upcoming matches against Scotland or Ireland.

3. The article mentions that Vunipola has been out of action since November but is now back in full training and looking sharp, with a potential return to international rugby. This contradicts the summary's claim that he has been ruled out of the Six Nations.

4. The article also mentions Vunipola's brother, Mako, who has recently returned from a knee problem, suggesting that the Vunipola referenced in the main body of the article is not Mako but another Vunipola. This implies that there are two Vunipolas, and the one discussed in the article is not the full-back but likely a forward, possibly Billy Vunipola, who is known for his role in the back row.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states Vunipola's position as a full-back and falsely claims that he has been ruled out of the Six Nations, whereas the article suggests he is on the path to recovery and may participate in the tournament.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Scotland full-back Vunipola has been ruled out of the Six Nations with a knee injury.
2. However, the article states that Vunipola could be in contention to face Scotland on March 11th or Ireland a week later, indicating that he has recovered quicker than expected from his knee injury.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Vunipola has been ruled out of the Six Nations, while the article suggests that he may be available for selection.
