Article:
The money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.
Once built, the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.
The current hospital was built in 1813, but it has become cramped and outdated.
The total cost of the project is £33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.
Matron Sue Taylor said: "It's very old and in the summer it's very, very hot. In the winter it's quite cold, there's lots of maintenance, lots of running repairs - it's a poor old tired building now.
"Sometimes your environment can have such an impact when you're trying to recover from an illness - we make the best of what we've got but when you walk into a new build it just lifts you and gives you that feeling of well-being.
"There is a real lovely feel about this hospital and for many years it's served us well, but we need something more modern."
In the past five years, three out of Somerset's 13 community hospitals have been replaced.
Work has also got under way on the new Jubilee Building at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.
Dr Donal Hynes, a Bridgwater GP and medical director at Somerset Primary Care Trust, said: "It will make a huge difference for me and my relationship with my patients.
"This is a great vote of confidence of the developments that have been achieved in Somerset where GPs, nurses, and therapists have got together to deliver a whole package of care that can be delivered in a one-stop shop setting."
Somerset PCT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bowers Lane, which will depend on planning permission.
The aim is to get the hospital finished by autumn 2014.

GPT4:
The summary states that "health officials from Somerset and Somerset have announced plans to build a new £33m NHS hospital in Somerset." Let's analyze the article to check the consistency of this statement.

1. The article mentions that the money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of a £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England. This supports the claim that a new hospital is being funded, but it does not specify that the announcement was made by "health officials from Somerset and Somerset."

2. The article specifies that the new hospital will have various facilities and mentions the total cost of the project as £33m. This aligns with the summary's mention of a "new £33m NHS hospital."

3. The article does not explicitly state that "health officials from Somerset and Somerset" made the announcement. Instead, it quotes Matron Sue Taylor and Dr. Donal Hynes, who are associated with the NHS in Somerset. The summary's phrasing could imply that two separate entities from Somerset made the announcement, which is not supported by the article.

4. The article mentions that the remaining balance for the project will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. This could be the source of confusion in the summary, as it may be interpreted that these two entities are making the announcement. However, the article does not state that these organizations announced the plans; it only mentions their financial contribution to the project.

5. The article provides additional context about the current hospital's condition and the need for a new facility, as well as other ongoing projects in Somerset, which are not mentioned in the summary.

6. The article also mentions that Somerset PCT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bowers Lane, subject to planning permission, and aims to finish by autumn 2014. This information is not included in the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately suggests that the announcement was made by "health officials from Somerset and Somerset," which is not a claim supported by the article. The article does not specify who made the announcement, and the summary's phrasing could be misinterpreted as referring to two separate entities from Somerset. The summary also omits several details provided in the article, such as the specific features of the new hospital, the condition of the current hospital, and the broader context of NHS facility investments in England.
