Article:
An area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated for most of the morning and early afternoon.
Other residents close by had been advised to open windows, stay indoors near walls and to avoid going outside.
An exclusion zone remains in force on the river while experts make safe the sea mine which was spotted on Monday.
It is thought to be a British mine, dating from the  1940s or 1950s.
The evacuation affected three streets, with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500m of the device.
There was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile, and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation.
Caledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services, affecting sailings from Gourock and Rothesay.
Ch Insp Elliot Brown, the local area commander for Inverclyde, stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure, and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gourock.
Lt Cdr Tim Castrinoyannakis, the officer in charge of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Unit, said that due to the deterioration of the mine it was not possible to conclude how much explosive material it still contained.
He said that because of this it was decided to move it to a safer place before dealing with it.
Inverclyde Council said: "Thanks to residents and businesses in Gourock for their patience while the cordon and safe evacuation procedures were carried out today."

Summary:
an unexploded world war two mine has been evacuated off the south coast of scotland after an explosive device was found.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions that an area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated due to the discovery of a sea mine. The summary inaccurately states that the mine itself has been evacuated. Mines cannot be evacuated; rather, areas around the mine are evacuated for safety reasons.

2. The article specifies that the mine was spotted on Monday and that an exclusion zone remains in force on the river. The summary does not mention the river or the exclusion zone, which is a significant detail regarding the location and the safety measures taken.

3. The article suggests that the mine is thought to be a British mine from the 1940s or 1950s, which would be consistent with World War II or the post-war era. However, the summary incorrectly refers to it as a "World War Two mine" without acknowledging the possibility that it could be from the 1950s, which is after World War II ended in 1945.

4. The article states that the evacuation affected three streets and residents within 500m of the device, with wider safety advice issued. The summary does not include any of these details about the scope of the evacuation or the safety advice given to residents.

5. The article mentions that the location is off the south coast of Scotland, specifically in the community of Gourock. The summary does not mention Gourock, which is an important detail for accurately identifying the location of the incident.

6. The article also includes information about the disruption to ferry services and the involvement of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Unit. The summary does not mention these details, which are relevant to understanding the impact of the mine's discovery and the response to it.

7. Lastly, the article concludes with a statement from Inverclyde Council thanking residents and businesses for their patience. This positive note of community cooperation is omitted from the summary.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the inaccurate description of the mine being evacuated, the omission of the river and exclusion zone, the potential error in dating the mine strictly to World War II, and the lack of specific details regarding the location, the scope of the evacuation, and the response efforts.
