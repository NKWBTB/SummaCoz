GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The summary states that "a haul of alcohol seized in China's Guangxi province has been arrested in China," which is incorrect. The article does not personify the haul of alcohol as something that can be arrested. Instead, it mentions that more than 5,300 bottles of alcohol were seized by investigators in the southern city of Liuzhou, which is in the Guangxi region.

2. The summary also mentions "a court in China has ruled," which is not supported by the article. The article does not reference any court ruling related to the seized alcohol. It only states that police in the Guangxi region are investigating the two distillers and that the Liuzhou Food and Drug Administration has made a statement about the incident.

3. The summary fails to mention key details from the article, such as the discovery of packets of Sildenafil (Viagra) in the seized alcohol, the value of the haul, and the broader context of food safety problems in China.

4. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it suggests a court ruling has taken place, which is not mentioned in the article, and it incorrectly implies that the alcohol itself has been subject to arrest.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces incorrect information about a court ruling, incorrectly personifies the alcohol as being arrested, and omits significant details provided in the article.
