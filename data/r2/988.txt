GPT4:
1. The summary begins by stating that Esteban Cambiasso says keeping Leicester in the Premier League would be up there with the best achievements of his career. This is consistent with the article, which quotes Cambiasso saying that helping keep Leicester in the Premier League will feel like winning a trophy and compares it to winning a cup or league with another team.

2. The summary mentions that the Foxes are currently seven points adrift at the bottom of the table, with only eight games remaining. This information is also consistent with the article, which provides the same details about Leicester City's position in the league and the number of games left.

3. The inconsistency arises with the final statement of the summary, which says Leicester face West Ham United at Upton Park on Saturday. The article does not mention the location of the upcoming game against West Ham United. Upton Park was the former home ground of West Ham United, but it was demolished after the club moved to the London Stadium in 2016. Since the article does not specify the venue of the match, the mention of Upton Park is incorrect and not supported by the article. This is the inconsistency in the summary.
