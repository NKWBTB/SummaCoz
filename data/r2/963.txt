GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement that Harry Kane has been an "incredible season for the PFA Player and Young Player of the Season." This statement implies that Harry Kane has already won both the PFA Player and Young Player of the Season awards. However, the article only states that he is nominated for both awards, not that he has won them. The article mentions that the awards ceremony is upcoming on Sunday, where Kane is up against other players like Eden Hazard and Alexis Sanchez for the top prize.

To summarize the inconsistency:

1. The summary claims Harry Kane has had an incredible season as the PFA Player and Young Player of the Season.
2. The article only states that Harry Kane is nominated for both the PFA Player and Young Player of the Year awards, not that he has won them.
3. The article indicates that the awards ceremony is yet to take place, and the winners have not been announced.

Therefore, the summary inaccurately represents Harry Kane's status regarding the PFA awards based on the information provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The article states that the video features Kane's long-range strike against Chelsea, his headed goal against Arsenal, and his debut goal for England, but the summary does not mention a long-range strike against Chelsea or a headed goal against Arsenal.
