Summary:
gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year, the government has confirmed.

GPT4:
The summary states that "gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year," which is inconsistent with the information provided in the article for several reasons:

1. The article does not specify that the pardons are for those convicted of "sexually abusing gay men." Instead, it refers to men convicted of "now-abolished sexual offences," which historically refers to consensual homosexual acts that were criminalized in the past, not sexual abuse.

2. The article does not mention that the pardons will begin "from next year." It states that the Justice Minister, Claire Sugden, wants to bring in arrangements "as soon as possible," but no specific timeline is given for when the pardons will start.

3. The article mentions that the motion will allow for pardons both posthumously and for living men, not just for a specific group of "gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men."

4. The article refers to the motion as "Turing's Law," named after Alan Turing, which is intended to address historical injustices against men who were convicted for homosexual acts that are no longer illegal. There is no mention of pardoning sexual abuse, which remains a crime.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the misrepresentation of the nature of the offenses being pardoned and the timeline for when the pardons will take effect. The article is about pardoning historical convictions for consensual homosexual acts, not sexual abuse, and does not provide a specific start date for the pardons.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the government has confirmed that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men. Instead, the article discusses the intention to pardon gay and bisexual men who were convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, in line with England and Wales' plans for automatic pardons under 'Turing's Law.' The article mentions the process of presenting a motion in the assembly for approval, securing executive agreement, and the aim of equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary inaccurately suggesting that the pardons are specifically for those convicted of sexually abusing gay men, while the article focuses on the broader context of pardoning men convicted of abolished sexual offences.
