Article:
A millionaire Tory donor and prominent party supporter has been a heavy cocaine user for years, the Daily Mail can reveal. The businessman’s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug. He has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes. The businessman’s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug (file image above) Just last month he attended the party’s high-profile donors’ ball, and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of Government policies. But despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him, he has now admitted – behind closed doors – to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis. His consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day – because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much. And remarkably – despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years – the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction. However he is not shy about appearing in the public eye. He always seems full of energy when caught on camera, and has been very talkative with journalists. He has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business, putting many details about his life into the public domain. The addict has also spoken out against Labour policies and in favour of the Conservative Government – including for moves which benefited him financially. Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball attended by David and Samantha Cameron in 2007 (above) The donor refused to comment, however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction, a source close to him said: ‘There’s a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified. ‘He is not a well man. He’s trying to sort it out and sort himself out. He definitely doesn't want to talk about it at this stage.’ Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball – a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich. The most recent ball – at the Grosvenor House Hotel on exclusive Park Lane – attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders. Tables for ten at the February event cost up to £15,000 each, while the minimum price for a single ticket was £500. Dinner was scheduled to go on for three-and-a-half hours with speeches by Mr Cameron and the Conservative chairman Lord Feldman. Guests could bid to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May, have a cup of tea with Boris Johnson, go for a 10km run with Iain Duncan Smith, or have a week in a luxury chalet in Switzerland. In the final big fundraiser ahead of the general election, £210,000 was spent on a bronze bust of Margaret Thatcher and £220,000 was bid for a week-long holiday in a Spanish fortress. One of the paying guests forked out £110,000 at the auction for a single night’s exclusive use of Annabel’s nightclub. But a major cocaine abuser was also among them, rubbing shoulders not just with hedge fund managers and oil tycoons, but also with major party figures – including Chief Whip Michael Gove, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

Summary:
david cameron leads a double life as a seedy drug addict.

GPT4:
The summary incorrectly attributes the double life of a "seedy drug addict" to David Cameron. Here's the step-by-step reasoning to identify the inconsistency:

1. The article discusses a millionaire Tory donor who is a heavy cocaine user and has admitted to being addicted to the class A drug.

2. The article mentions that this businessman has personally met Prime Minister David Cameron, but it does not state that David Cameron himself leads a double life as a drug addict.

3. The phrase "leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes" is used to describe the unnamed businessman, not David Cameron.

4. The article maintains the anonymity of the businessman due to a court order and does not suggest any illegal or scandalous behavior on the part of David Cameron.

5. The summary incorrectly conflates the identity of the unnamed businessman with David Cameron, leading to a false statement that is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the subject of the article, attributing the actions and lifestyle of the unnamed businessman to David Cameron.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that David Cameron leads a double life as a seedy drug addict, but the article does not mention anything about David Cameron using drugs or leading a double life.
2. The article actually discusses a millionaire Tory donor who is addicted to cocaine and has been attending Conservative Party fundraising events, but the summary misleadingly attributes this information to David Cameron.
3. The summary is not supported by the information in the article, which only mentions the addiction of the unnamed millionaire donor and does not mention David Cameron at all.
