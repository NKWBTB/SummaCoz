Article:
Hatfield Colliery closed in June with the loss of 430 jobs after almost a century of production.
The short ceremony took place at the mine, near Doncaster.
John Grogan, chairman of the Hatfield Employee Benefit Trust, which has run the mine since 2013, said it was "the end of an era".
He said: "On Monday the company will be wound up in the High Court and that will represent the end of coal mining in South Yorkshire after many generations.
"In 1980 there were 50,000 miners in South Yorkshire. On Monday morning when we're in the High Court there will be none.
"We're presenting this piece of coal as a symbol of our respect for all the miners who have gone before us in South Yorkshire and helped build the economy of our country and keep the lights on for many decades."
Accepting the gift the Mayor of Doncaster Ros Jones said: "On behalf of Doncaster and South Yorkshire I'm humbled to accept this."
The only remaining deep coal mine in England, Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire, is due to close later this year.

Summary:
the last deep coal mine in south yorkshire has been presented to the owners of a south yorkshire colliery.

GPT4:
The summary states that "the last deep coal mine in South Yorkshire has been presented to the owners of a South Yorkshire colliery." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons:

1. The article does not mention the presentation of a coal mine to anyone. Instead, it talks about a piece of coal being presented as a symbol of respect for miners. The summary incorrectly suggests that an entire coal mine was given as a gift, which is not supported by the article.

2. The article indicates that the Hatfield Colliery has closed and that the Hatfield Employee Benefit Trust, which has run the mine since 2013, is winding up the company. There is no mention of the colliery being presented to its owners; the closure is described as the end of an era for coal mining in South Yorkshire.

3. The summary's reference to "the owners of a South Yorkshire colliery" is vague and does not align with the article's content. The article does not discuss any transaction or presentation involving the owners of a colliery.

4. The article mentions that the only remaining deep coal mine in England, Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire, is due to close later in the year. This is unrelated to the presentation of a piece of coal during the ceremony at Hatfield Colliery.

In conclusion, the summary misrepresents the events described in the article by inaccurately stating that a coal mine was presented to its owners, when in fact, it was a symbolic piece of coal that was given to the Mayor of Doncaster during a ceremony marking the closure of the Hatfield Colliery.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the last deep coal mine in South Yorkshire has been presented to the owners of a South Yorkshire colliery.
2. The article does not mention anything about presenting the last deep coal mine to the owners of a South Yorkshire colliery. Instead, the article mentions the Mayor of Doncaster Ros Jones accepting the gift.
