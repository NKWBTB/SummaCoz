We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen."Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome "might come today, it might come next week".There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was "more fight in her" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was "unpredictable" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: "I have watched her grow up on Skype."She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English."Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing."Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a "prisoner of conscience" who was being held for "peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association".Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: "Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release."

Summary:
the wife of a british banker accused of plotting to topple the uk has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.

GPT4:
1. The article states that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years, not two-and-a-half years as mentioned in the summary. This is a direct inconsistency regarding the length of her sentence.

2. The article specifies that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was accused of plotting to topple the government in Tehran, Iran, not the UK. The summary incorrectly states that she was accused of plotting against the UK.

3. The article does not mention Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband's profession, so we cannot confirm from the information provided that he is a banker. The summary's reference to her being "the wife of a British banker" is not supported by the article.

4. The article is focused on the appeal against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence and her family's situation, including her husband's criticism of the UK government's lack of action and the fact that their daughter is being looked after by her grandparents in Iran. The summary does not reflect any of these details and instead presents an inaccurate account of the charges and sentence length.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the length of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence, the country against which she was accused of plotting, and her husband's profession, none of which align with the facts presented in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states, "the wife of a British banker accused of plotting to topple the UK has been jailed for two-and-a-half years."
2. However, the article discusses the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is not a British banker and is not accused of plotting to topple the UK. She is a British-Iranian woman who was sentenced to five years in Iran on different charges.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which misidentifies Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's occupation and the nature of her charges, and it falsely suggests that she was jailed in the UK.
