Summary:
older people in care homes in wales are to be given more care in care, a bbc investigation has found.

GPT4:
The summary states that "older people in care homes in Wales are to be given more care in care," which suggests that the article is about an increase in the level of care provided to older people in care homes. However, the article does not mention any specific plans or actions to increase the care for older people in residential care homes. Instead, the article discusses the Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Sarah Rochira, calling on pensioners and their friends and families to share their experiences of residential care. The purpose of this call is to gather evidence to develop recommendations for care providers and public bodies.

The article details the commissioner's review into the quality of life and care of older people in residential care in Wales, with the intent to highlight both good care and the impact of poor care. It mentions that the commissioner has seen the positive impact of high-quality care but also acknowledges the correspondence received about varying quality of life and care in residential care homes.

Furthermore, the article includes a statement from the chair of Care Forum Wales, Mario Kreft, expressing disappointment that the commissioner's advisory panel does not include a provider expert. This indicates that the focus of the article is on the review process and the composition of the advisory panel, rather than on any findings from a BBC investigation or an immediate increase in care provision.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary misrepresents the article by suggesting an increase in care provision, which is not supported by the content of the article. The article is actually about a review being conducted to assess and improve the quality of life and care for older people in residential care in Wales.
