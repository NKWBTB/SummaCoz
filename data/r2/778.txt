Article:
Mila Kunis is being sued by a Ukrainian wannabe singer who claims the Hollywood actress 'stole her pet chicken' as children. Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo  claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven. Wannabe: 'Singer' Kristina Karo says she and Kunis were inseparable in first grade, but that the actress was jealous of her pet chicken 'Doggie' and stole the hen

GPT4:
1. The summary states that Kristina Karo alleges she was a classmate of Mila Kunis, and the pair were 'inseparable' growing up. However, the article points out an inconsistency in this claim by noting that Karo's online bio describes her as being from a village that is a three-hour drive and more than 100 miles away from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. This suggests that they could not have been as inseparable as Karo claims due to the significant distance between their hometowns.

2. The summary mentions that Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine and that Kunis stole it from her. However, the summary omits the bizarre nature of the lawsuit and the fact that it was filed 25 years after the alleged incident, which is a critical aspect of the story's context.

3. The summary correctly states that Karo claims Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine. However, it fails to capture the full extent of the allegations, including the emotional distress and the specific demand for $5,000 in damages to cover therapy bills, which are key elements of the lawsuit as described in the article.

4. The summary does not mention the detail that Karo's lawsuit claims the proximity to Kunis in Los Angeles has brought back bad memories and necessitated therapy again, which is an important part of the narrative and the reason for the lawsuit according to the article.

5. The summary leaves out the information about Karo's aspirations to launch a singing career in Los Angeles and how she claims the alleged theft has prevented her from pursuing the American dream, which adds to the understanding of her motives and the context of the lawsuit.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it omits key details about the distance between Karo's and Kunis's childhood homes, the timing and nature of the lawsuit, the specific damages sought, and the impact on Karo's life and aspirations. These omissions and inaccuracies result in a summary that does not fully represent the content and nuances of the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Kristina Karo alleges that she and Mila Kunis were classmates, inseparable, and that Kunis stole her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine.
2. However, the article states that Kristina Karo alleges she was a classmate of Mila Kunis, and they were inseparable growing up. However, it doesn't specify that Mila Kunis stole her pet chicken. The summary adds the detail that Kunis stole the pet chicken.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary includes a specific claim that Mila Kunis stole Kristina Karo's pet chicken, which is not explicitly stated in the article.
