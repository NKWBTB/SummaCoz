Article:
(CNN)The first daughter to be married from the hit reality show "19 Kids and Counting" has also become the first mother. People magazine reports that Jill (Duggar) Dillard gave birth Monday to a 9-pound, 10-ounce son she and husband Derick have named Israel David. Jill's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, posted a video of the new family on their official Facebook page. The baby was a bit tardy, going past his due date by more than a week. Dillard, who is a student midwife, said she gave herself two due dates and was prepared for the wait. "I have told myself, 'First-time moms often go a week and a half over, so don't get discouraged,' " she told People. "When everyone else is asking you, 'When are you going to have that baby?' The baby will come when the baby comes." Dillard has a ways to go to catch up with her mother. Her super-sized family and their lives have been well-documented on their TLC series, including Jill and Derick's wedding on June 21. Eldest Duggar son Josh is already the father of three children, and his wife, Anna, is expecting their fourth in July.

Summary:
dillard says she has no plans to be married.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is evident when we compare it to the information provided in the article. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that Jill (Duggar) Dillard gave birth to a son, which implies that she is already married. The birth of a child typically follows marriage, especially in the context of the Duggar family, who are known for their conservative values.

2. The article mentions Jill's husband, Derick, indicating that she is indeed married. The use of the term "husband" is a clear indicator of marital status.

3. The article also references "Jill and Derick's wedding on June 21," which is a direct statement of the fact that Jill Dillard is married.

4. The summary's claim that "Dillard says she has no plans to be married" is directly contradicted by the article's information about her marriage and her recent childbirth within that marriage.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it falsely states that Jill Dillard has no plans to be married when, in fact, she is already married to Derick Dillard.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Dillard has no plans to be married.
2. The article states that Dillard is the first daughter to be married on the TV show.
3. The inconsistency is that the summary states Dillard has no plans to marry when she already is married.
