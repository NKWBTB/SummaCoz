GPT4:
1. The article discusses the actions of Clive Weatherhogg, not a woman. The summary incorrectly identifies the perpetrator as a woman.

2. The article states that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man, and of causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images. The summary inaccurately states that the offences were against "a woman and a woman," which does not reflect the details provided in the article.

3. The article does not mention the length of the sentence that Clive Weatherhogg received. The summary claims that the sentence was six years in prison, but this information is not supported by the article.

4. The article specifies that Clive Weatherhogg was placed on the sex offenders register and that the case was remitted to the High Court for sentencing due to its greater sentencing powers. However, the actual sentence is not provided in the article.

5. The summary fails to mention Clive Weatherhogg's name, which is a critical piece of information, and instead incorrectly refers to the perpetrator as "a woman."

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it misidentifies the gender of the perpetrator, inaccurately describes the victims of the offences, includes a specific sentence length not mentioned in the article, and omits the name of the person convicted.
