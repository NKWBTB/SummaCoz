Article:
(CNN)The health of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in hospital with pneumonia since February 5, has deteriorated further, the government said Wednesday. The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. "Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further," the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. "We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image," Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004. The elder Lee has been credited with Singapore's remarkable transformation from a colonial trading post to a prosperous financial center. However, he has also been a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents.

GPT4:
The summary states that "Lee, 91, is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore." This statement is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The article does not provide the current status of Lee Kuan Yew's health or confirm that he is still alive and on a ventilator. Instead, it mentions that his health had deteriorated further and that there was a hoax about his supposed demise.

2. The article discusses the government's response to the hoax and the investigation into the false report of Lee Kuan Yew's death. This implies that the situation is uncertain and that the summary's assertion may not be accurate at the time of reporting.

3. The article provides a background on Lee Kuan Yew's role in Singapore's history, his tenure as prime minister, and his legacy, but it does not reiterate his current health status beyond the mention of the deterioration and the hoax.

Therefore, the summary's claim that Lee Kuan Yew is currently on a ventilator in the ICU is not supported by the information provided in the article, which focuses on the deterioration of his health, the hoax about his death, and his historical significance.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Lee Kuan Yew, aged 91, is currently on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore.
2. However, the article provides additional information about Lee Kuan Yew's health status. The article mentions that the health of Lee Kuan Yew has deteriorated further, and he is critically ill in the ICU. The summary does not capture the critical condition and the deterioration mentioned in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary simplifies the information by stating that Lee, 91, is on a ventilator without including the crucial details about the deterioration in his health and his critical condition in the intensive care unit as mentioned in the article.
