1. The summary states that "the words 'christ' have been placed on a list of banned words by marks & spencer." This is consistent with the article, which mentions that "The words 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' have been placed on a list of banned words by Marks & Spencer and cannot be used in gift messages."

2. The summary also mentions that "'jesus christ' join other banned words including 'f ***' and 'gay'." This is partially inconsistent with the article. While the article does confirm that 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' are banned, it does not explicitly state that the word 'gay' is banned. Instead, it says that 'f***' and 'gay' are included in the list of banned words, but it does not clarify if 'gay' is banned or accepted. This ambiguity makes the summary potentially misleading.

3. The summary includes "** k can also be included in messages." This is inconsistent with the article, which states that 'd**k' can be included in messages. The summary has replaced the word 'd**k' with '** k,' which is not a direct representation of the information provided in the article.

This is consistent with the article, which tells the story of a customer who was prevented from completing her order for a £35 bouquet due to the inclusion of the word 'Christ' in the gift message.
