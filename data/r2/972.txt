GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Porto beat 5-0 at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night." This is inconsistent with the article, which clearly states that Bayern Munich led their opponents 5-0 at half-time and eventually won the match with a score of 6-1. The summary incorrectly suggests that Porto won the match.

2. The summary repeats the information about Pep Guardiola's underwear being on show, which is consistent with the article. However, it is mentioned twice in the summary, which is redundant.

3. The summary correctly mentions that the incident occurred during the Champions League match on Tuesday, which is consistent with the article.

4. The summary's last sentence, "the bayern beat porto in the champions league on tuesday," is consistent with the article, which confirms that Bayern Munich won the match against Porto.

The main inconsistency in the summary is the incorrect statement about the match's outcome, suggesting Porto won 5-0, which contradicts the article's information that Bayern Munich was the victor with a 6-1 scoreline.
