Article:
Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

Summary:
national league side torquay united have signed striker myles anderson on a two-year contract after he was released by the national league club.

GPT4:
1. The article states that a player named Anderson has cancelled his contract with Barrow to join their National League rivals. However, it does not specify the first name of Anderson, nor does it mention that the player's first name is Myles.

2. The article mentions that Anderson is a centre-back, not a striker as stated in the summary.

3. The article does not mention the length of the contract that Anderson has signed with the new club. Therefore, the claim in the summary that he has signed a two-year contract is not supported by the information in the article.

4. The article does mention a player named Keating, who is a striker and is 21 years old. This could be a point of confusion, as the summary incorrectly combines details about Anderson and Keating.

5. The article does not state that Anderson was "released" by his former club; it says that he "cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent."

6. The article does not specify which National League club Anderson has joined, so the summary's claim that he has joined Torquay United is not verifiable based on the information provided.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states Anderson's position, the length of his contract, and his first name, while also incorrectly suggesting that he was released and that he joined Torquay United.
