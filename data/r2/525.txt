Fellow tenants Newport Gwent Dragons are subject to a takeover bid from the Welsh Rugby Union, who have said they see Rodney Parade "as a rugby venue."County have a lease to use the ground - and have primacy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League - until 2023."Our view is quite clear - we've got a contract," Foxall said."That is something that we're expecting to be honoured."Obviously there is a vote in early May by the shareholders for Newport Rugby and we'll wait and see what happens with that."The WRU's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday, 9 May.In 2013 the Exiles agreed a 10-year lease to use the stadium after gaining promotion to the Football League from the Conference.Newport RFC chairman Will Godfrey said both County and Newport Squash Club, who are also based at Rodney Parade, are protected under their current agreements.Godfrey said the WRU had been made aware of that fact. The WRU have signalled their intention to install an artificial surface which is against Football League rules.On the pitch, County are two points clear of the League Two relegation with two games remaining after six wins in 10 games under caretaker manager Mike Flynn and can clinch survival this weekend if they win and rivals Hartlepool lose.Newport secured promotion back to the Football League in 2013 and Foxall said relegation to the National League would be a "massive" blow,"To lose that status again, in a relatively short space of time would be pretty devastating for the fans but also for the city of Newport," Foxall told BBC Wales Today.

Summary:
newport rfc chairman gavin foxall says the welsh rugby union\'s takeover of newport gwent dragons will be the subject of a takeover bid.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has a takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, not Newport RFC. The summary incorrectly states that Newport RFC Chairman Gavin Foxall says the WRU's takeover is of Newport RFC.

2. The article identifies Newport RFC Chairman as Will Godfrey, not Gavin Foxall. The summary incorrectly names Gavin Foxall as the chairman of Newport RFC.

3. The article does not attribute any direct quotes to Gavin Foxall regarding the takeover bid of the Newport Gwent Dragons by the WRU. Instead, it quotes Foxall on the impact of potential relegation on Newport County AFC and the importance of their contract to use Rodney Parade.

4. The summary conflates the roles and statements of two different individuals (Gavin Foxall and Will Godfrey) and incorrectly associates the takeover bid with the wrong rugby club (Newport RFC instead of Newport Gwent Dragons).

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it misidentifies the subject of the takeover bid, the chairman of Newport RFC, and incorrectly attributes a statement to Gavin Foxall that is not supported by the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Newport RFC Chairman Gavin Foxall is stating that the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be the subject of a takeover bid.
2. However, the article states that Gavin Foxall is discussing Newport RFC's lease at Rodney Parade and the potential impact of the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons. There is no mention of a takeover bid in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that a takeover bid is the subject of the discussion, while the article focuses on the lease and the impact on Newport RFC.
