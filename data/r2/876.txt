Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive.

In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary arises from the incorrect description of the septum piercing and the repetition of a statement. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The summary starts with "UNK is the process of severing the wall between the two cheeks." This statement is inconsistent with the article, which describes the septum piercing as the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils, not cheeks.

2. The term "UNK" is used in the summary, which is not a term or reference found in the article. It seems to be a placeholder or an error, making the summary inconsistent because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.

3. The summary repeats the phrase "it is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls" twice. This repetition is unnecessary and does not contribute to a coherent summary. Moreover, the article mentions this use of the septum ring only once, in the context of its practical application with bulls, not as a primary focus of the article, which is about the septum piercing as a fashion trend.

4. The summary fails to mention any of the key points related to the fashion trend aspect of the septum piercing, the celebrities who have been wearing it, or its cultural significance in various societies—all of which are prominent points in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately describes the septum piercing, uses an undefined term "UNK," unnecessarily repeats a statement, and omits the main focus of the article, which is the septum piercing as a fashion trend and its cultural significance.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that "UNK is the process of severing the wall between the two cheeks."
2. However, the article provides information about septum piercing, but it does not mention the process as "severing the wall between the two cheeks." Instead, it briefly discusses the historical and cultural significance of septum piercing in various regions and its modern use as a fashion trend. The summary's statement about the process of septum piercing is not accurately supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary describes the septum piercing process differently from the article, which focuses on its historical and cultural context.
