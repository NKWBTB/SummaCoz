Summary:
torquay united have signed barrow\'s myles keating and barrow\'s ruairi keating on loan until january.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions that centre-back Anderson, not Myles Keating, has cancelled his contract with Barrow to join their National League rivals. There is no mention of a player named Myles Keating in the article.

2. The article does talk about a player named Ruairi Keating, but it does not state that he was signed on loan. Instead, it suggests that he was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson and that his move is subject to international clearance, implying a permanent transfer rather than a loan.

3. The article does not specify any time frame for Ruairi Keating's signing, such as "until January." It simply states that he has joined the team and is awaiting international clearance.

4. The summary incorrectly states that both players were signed by Torquay United, but the article only mentions Ruairi Keating in connection with Torquay United. Anderson's new team is not specified, only that he has joined National League rivals.

5. The summary incorrectly refers to "Barrow's Myles Keating and Barrow's Ruairi Keating," which suggests that both players were with Barrow and both have been signed by Torquay United, which is not supported by the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly names a player (Myles Keating), suggests a loan deal that is not mentioned in the article, fails to provide an accurate timeframe for the transfer, and inaccurately states that both players were signed by Torquay United from Barrow.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Torquay United has signed Barrow's Myles Keating and Barrow's Ruairi Keating on loan until January.
2. However, the article mentions that Centre-back Anderson has canceled his Barrow contract to join National League rivals. It does not explicitly mention that Torquay United has signed Myles Keating and Ruairi Keating on loan until January. The article focuses on Anderson's move and does not provide details about the mentioned loan signings.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies that Torquay United has signed the two players on loan until January, which is not supported by the information in the article.
