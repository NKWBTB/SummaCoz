Article:
Mila Kunis is being sued by a Ukrainian wannabe singer who claims the Hollywood actress 'stole her pet chicken' as children. Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo  claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven. Wannabe: 'Singer' Kristina Karo says she and Kunis were inseparable in first grade, but that the actress was jealous of her pet chicken 'Doggie' and stole the hen

GPT4:
1. The summary incorrectly refers to "ms bateman" when the article is about Mila Kunis. There is no mention of anyone with the last name Bateman in the article, so this is an inconsistency.

2. The summary repeats the phrase "she claims the pair were 'inseparable'" twice, which is redundant and does not accurately reflect the article's content.

3. The summary states "she claims she was 'envious of her pet hen'" but does not clarify who "she" refers to in this context. In the article, it is Kristina Karo who alleges that Mila Kunis was envious of her pet chicken, not the other way around.

4. The summary does not mention the key point of the lawsuit, which is that Kristina Karo is suing Mila Kunis for $5,000 for the emotional distress caused by the alleged theft of her pet chicken 25 years ago.

5. The summary fails to include important details such as the pet chicken's name, "Doggie," the fact that the alleged incident took place when Mila Kunis was seven years old, and that the lawsuit is related to Karo's trauma and therapy bills.

6. The summary does not mention that Kristina Karo is now living in Los Angeles and that being in close proximity to Mila Kunis has allegedly brought back bad memories, necessitating therapy again.

7. The summary omits the fact that the article points out a discrepancy in the story, as Mila Kunis lived more than 100 miles away from the village where Kristina Karo claims to have been raised.

Overall, the summary contains inaccuracies and fails to capture the essence of the article, which is about a bizarre lawsuit involving an alleged childhood incident between Mila Kunis and Kristina Karo over a pet chicken.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Kristina Karo alleges she was a classmate of Mila Kunis and that they were 'inseparable'. It repeats the claim that Kristina Karo was 'envious' of Mila Kunis's pet chicken.
2. However, the article states that Kristina Karo alleges she was a classmate of Mila Kunis and that they were 'inseparable'. It repeats the claim that Kristina Karo was 'envious' of Mila Kunis's pet chicken.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly states the same information multiple times without introducing any new details or contradictions that would make it inconsistent with the article.
