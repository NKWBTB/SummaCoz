Summary:
league one side oldham athletic have signed midfielder james browning on loan from chelsea until the end of the season.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions a player who has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for the Toffees. Goodison Park is the home stadium of Everton FC, not Chelsea FC. This indicates that the player is associated with Everton, not Chelsea.

2. The article does not mention Oldham Athletic at all. There is no information provided about a loan to Oldham Athletic or any other club.

3. The article refers to the player as a former England Under-21 international, but does not specify the player's position. The summary incorrectly identifies the player as a midfielder named James Browning, while the article does not provide a first name or confirm the player's position.

4. The article includes a quote from the player expressing excitement about making an impact and hearing good things about "the club," but it does not specify which club he is referring to. The summary assumes he is talking about Oldham Athletic, but this is not supported by the article.

5. The article concludes by directing readers to a dedicated page for the latest football transfers and a Premier League tracker, but it does not confirm the transfer of the player to Oldham Athletic or any other team.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the player's parent club as Chelsea instead of Everton, claims a loan to Oldham Athletic that is not mentioned in the article, misidentifies the player's position and name, and assumes details about the player's intentions that are not supported by the provided text.

HUMAN:
1. The article states that James Browning is a former England Under-21 international who has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for Everton.
2. The summary states that James Browning has been signed by League One side Oldham Athletic on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. James Browning is currently a player for Everton, not Chelsea, and he has not been loaned to Oldham Athletic.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
