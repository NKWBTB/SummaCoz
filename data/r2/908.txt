GPT4:
The summary states that a dress worn by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara was auctioned off for $137,000, which is consistent with the article. It also correctly mentions that the dress featured a gray jacket with a black zigzag applique and that it was worn in several key scenes of the 1939 movie "Gone With the Wind." However, the summary omits the fact that the dress included a skirt as part of the ensemble, which is an important detail given in the article.

The inconsistency lies in the omission of the skirt component of the dress in the summary. The article clearly states that the dress is a "jacket and full skirt ensemble," which means the summary should have included both parts to accurately represent the item auctioned. By mentioning only the jacket, the summary provides an incomplete description of the dress.

To correct the summary, it should read: "A dress worn by Vivien Leigh when she played Scarlett O'Hara, featuring a gray jacket and full skirt with a black zigzag applique, sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday. The dress was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie." This would ensure that the summary is consistent with the article by including all relevant details about the dress.
