The Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life', pictured at George's christening in 2013 . Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life’. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne’s frustrations is the so-called ‘Middletonisation’ of his son William’s life — specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole’s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called ‘March of the Middletons’ that he has complained to friends: ‘They never let me see my grandson.’ Adds a source: ‘Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.’ It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it’s a deliberate move on William’s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles’s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate’s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot’s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William’s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

Summary:
charles is said to have become increasingly increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Charles is said to have become increasingly increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role." This statement suggests that Prince Charles is confused or uncertain about his limited involvement in Prince George's life.

2. The article, however, does not indicate that Prince Charles is "perplexed." Instead, it describes him as "frustrated" and "vexed" about the situation, which implies that he is clear about his feelings and the reasons for them.

3. The article details the reasons for Prince Charles's frustration, specifically mentioning the "Middletonisation" of Prince William's life and the significant amount of time William spends with his in-laws, Michael and Carole Middleton. It also mentions Charles's complaint to friends that "They never let me see my grandson."

4. The article provides examples of the Middletons' involvement in Prince William's family life, such as dictating Prince George's routine and spending Christmas at Anmer Hall instead of with the Queen, which traditionally would be expected.

5. The article concludes with a statement from a Clarence House spokesman, which does not confirm the specifics of Prince Charles's relationship with his grandson but asserts that he "enjoys an excellent relationship with his grandson."

6. Based on the information provided in the article, the summary's use of the word "perplexed" is inconsistent with the article's description of Prince Charles's feelings and the context of his situation. The correct term, as supported by the article, would be "frustrated" or "vexed," not "perplexed."

HUMAN:
1. The summary mentions charles is said to have become increasingly increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role. But the fact in article is Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life.
2. The increasingly is repeated twice in summary which is inconsistent with original sentence in article.
3. Without the content 'he occupies in the young Prince’s life', the reader could have missunderstanding of the summary because the two sentences in summary and article may have different meanings which also is inconsistent.
