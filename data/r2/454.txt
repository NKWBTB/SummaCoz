GPT4:
1. The article states that there had been concerns about whether the new owners would take on the existing workers' pension scheme.

2. However, Unite regional officer Steve Harley is quoted saying that they had productive talks and were given guarantees that all current agreements would be honored.

3. Unite also mentioned that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004, and its members currently have an alternative pension scheme that is unaffected by the takeover.

4. The Boparan Private Office confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.

5. At no point does the article state that the new owners are planning to change the pension scheme. Instead, it emphasizes that the existing arrangements will be maintained.

Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly suggests that the new owners are planning to change the pension scheme, while the article clearly states that the existing pension arrangements will be honored and unaffected by the takeover.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the new owners of Bernard Matthews have said they believe a new pension scheme will be changed.

3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that there will be changes to the pension scheme under the new ownership, while the article explicitly states that the current pension arrangements will be honored and continued without any changes.
