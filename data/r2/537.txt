GPT4:
1. The article discusses a potential deal involving a person named Wright and Billericay Town FC, not Sutton United. There is no mention of Sutton United anywhere in the article.

2. The article refers to Wright potentially buying a 20% stake in Billericay Town FC and possibly becoming a club director. It does not mention anything about Wright signing as a player for any club.

3. The article mentions that Billericay Town FC is in the Isthmian League Premier Division, which is a different league from the National League where Sutton United plays.

4. The article also talks about Billericay Town FC's recent takeover by Glenn Tamplin and the signing of former England international Paul Konchesky. It does not discuss any player transfers to or from Sutton United.

5. The summary's claim that Akil Wright is signing a two-year deal with Sutton United is not supported by any information in the article. The article does not even mention a person named Akil Wright; it refers to a person with the last name Wright, but their first name is not given.

Based on these points, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it introduces information about Sutton United and a player named Akil Wright that is not present in the article. The article is focused on Billericay Town FC and a potential investment by a person with the last name Wright.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Sutton United has signed Akil Wright on a two-year deal.
2. However, the article states that Akil Wright potentially purchases 20% of Billericay and becomes a club director.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests that Akil Wright has signed with Sutton United on a two-year deal, while the article discusses Akil Wright's potential involvement with Billericay Football Club and becoming a club director.
