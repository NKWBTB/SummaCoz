Summary:
plans for a disused power station in southampton have been given the go-ahead by the government.

GPT4:
The summary states that "plans for a disused power station in Southampton have been given the go-ahead by the government." However, the article does not mention any approval by the government for the plans. Instead, the article discusses the developers' vision for the site and what the development would include, such as a petal-shaped glass structure, a marina, housing, and restaurants, as well as fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth.

The article also mentions that an application for outline planning permission is due later in the year, which implies that approval has not yet been granted. Since the building could start in 2018, the planning process is still in the future relative to the time of the article.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary claims the plans have been approved, while the article indicates that the plans are still in the proposal stage and awaiting permission.
