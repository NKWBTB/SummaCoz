Summary:
sean long\'s injury-time equaliser earned blackpool a draw at colchester.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Sean Long's injury-time equaliser earned Blackpool a draw at Colchester." However, the article does not mention a player named Sean Long at all. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is referring to a player who was not involved in the match according to the article.

2. The article details that Blackpool's goal was scored by Jamille Matt from a delivery by Nathan Delfouneso, and Colchester United's equaliser was scored by Kurtis Guthrie. There is no mention of a goal being scored in injury time or by a player named Sean Long.

3. The article concludes with the match ending in a 1-1 draw, with no additional goals mentioned beyond those scored by Jamille Matt and Kurtis Guthrie. This further confirms that there was no injury-time equaliser by any Blackpool player, let alone by someone named Sean Long.

4. The article does mention an injury time event involving a player named Sean Murray from Colchester United, who was shown a straight red card for a bad tackle on Jim McAlister. It's possible that the name "Sean Long" in the summary is a confusion with "Sean Murray," but the context is completely different as it relates to a red card, not a goal.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly names a player (Sean Long) who is not mentioned in the article and incorrectly attributes an injury-time equaliser to Blackpool, which did not occur according to the match report. The actual goalscorers and the sequence of events in the article do not support the information presented in the summary.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Sean Long's injury-time equalizer earned Blackpool a draw at Colchester. 
2. However, the article does not mention Sean Long scoring an injury-time equalizer. Instead, it describes the events of the match, including the goals scored by other players and the final result being a draw (1-1).
3. Therefore, the inconsistency is due to the error in the summary that implies Sean Long's specific goal, which the article does not support.
