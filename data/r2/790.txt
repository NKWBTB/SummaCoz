(CNN)They may not be "Star Trek"-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. "I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years," NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. "We know where to look. We know how to look," she said. "In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road." NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. "Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice," the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. "We are not talking about little green men," Stofan said at the panel. "We are talking about little microbes." Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. "I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star," he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? "Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low," he said. "And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting."

Summary:
nasa scientist ellen stofan : `` i think we 're going to have strong indications of life beyond earth within a decade '' scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies . `` we know how to look , '' nasa chief scientist says . the hubble space telescope may not be `` star trek '' - type extraterrestrials .

GPT4:
1. The summary begins with a quote from NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan, stating, "I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade." This statement is consistent with the article, which reports Stofan's prediction of strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade and definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years.

2. The summary mentions that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies. This is also consistent with the article, which notes that NASA released a graphic showing evidence or indications of water on various celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa.

3. The summary includes another quote from Stofan, "We know how to look," which is consistent with the article's report that Stofan said, "We know where to look. We know how to look."

4. The inconsistency arises with the last part of the summary, which states, "the hubble space telescope may not be 'star trek' - type extraterrestrials." This statement is not supported by the article. The article does not make any comparison between the Hubble Space Telescope and "Star Trek"-type extraterrestrials. Instead, the article mentions that the Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries of water in the universe and provides evidence of a saltwater ocean on Ganymede, one of Jupiter's moons. The reference to "Star Trek"-type extraterrestrials in the article is in the context of clarifying that NASA is not talking about intelligent alien civilizations but rather microorganisms. The summary incorrectly suggests that the Hubble Space Telescope itself may not be like "Star Trek"-type extraterrestrials, which is a nonsensical comparison and not a point made in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that NASA scientist Ellen Stofan said, "we know how to look."
2. However, the article states that Ellen Stofan said, "I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade."
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary attributes the statement "we know how to look" directly to Ellen Stofan, while in the article, this statement is not explicitly made by her but rather a general assertion about humanity's capability.
