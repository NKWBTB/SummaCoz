Article:
Ander Herrera has caught the eye in recent weeks after cementing a spot in Manchester United's starting line-up but it appears he does not actually have a clear sight at goal. Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net. Manchester United star Ander Herrera scores his side's opening goal against Aston Villa with his eyes shut The Spanish midfielder appears to have his eyes closed as he strikes at Brad Guzan's goal Aston Villa and England midfielder Fabian Delph attempts to block Herrera's left-footed shot His eyes were wide open when he struck an impressive first-time shot against Yeovil in the third round of the FA Cup back in January. However his double against Aston Villa and his goals against Queens Park Rangers, Leicester, Preston and Swansea all came without Manchester United's summer signing having to make eye contact with the ball. Herrera appears to have a history of shooting with his eyes closed as the image of his goal for Spain's Under 20 side back in 2009 shows.

'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot.'

Summary:

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Manchester United beat Aston Villa 2-1 in the Premier League on Saturday." However, the article does not provide the final score of the match. It only mentions that Ander Herrera scored a brace (two goals) against Aston Villa. Without the final score in the article, we cannot confirm that the match ended with a 2-1 victory for Manchester United.

2. The summary correctly states that "Ander Herrera scored a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon." This is consistent with the article, which mentions that Herrera netted two goals in the match against Aston Villa.

3. The last part of the summary is incoherent and does not make sense: "ander herrera 's eyes closed as he watches his eyes in the window." This sentence is not only grammatically incorrect but also does not align with any information provided in the article. The article discusses Herrera's tendency to score with his eyes closed, but there is no mention of him watching his eyes in a window.

In conclusion, the inconsistency lies in the incorrect final score mentioned in the summary and the nonsensical and incorrect final sentence. The article does not provide a final score, and the last sentence of the summary does not accurately reflect any content from the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the article discusses Manchester United's victory over Aston Villa, Ander Herrera scoring a brace, and Herrera's closed eyes while watching the game. While it briefly mentions the match against Aston Villa and Herrera's goals, it focuses on the wrong aspect, which is about Herrera's eyes being closed while scoring, and it doesn't mention the match result.
2. The article indeed talks about Manchester United's victory over Aston Villa and Ander Herrera scoring a brace, but it primarily focuses on the unusual observation that Herrera often scores with his eyes closed. It provides details about several instances of this happening.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary emphasizes the match result and events, while the article's primary focus is on Ander Herrera's tendency to score with his eyes closed.
