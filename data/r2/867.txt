With just two weekends of Football League action to play, and one in the Conference, it is crunch time for a number of clubs. Some are fighting for promotion and some relegation, but this Saturday could see a number of ups and downs in English football. Here, Sportsmail's guide takes you through the permutations in the Championship, League One, League Two and the Conference. Watford can be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth or Middlesbrough lose and Norwich fail to win Rotherham's desire to stave off relegation to League One has been made more difficult by a points deduction Steve McClaren will be desperate to manage in the Premier League again; Derby can secure a play-off spot Championship Watford (away to Brighton) will be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth (home to Bolton, Monday) or Middlesbrough (away to Fulham) lose and Norwich (away to Rotherham) fail to win. Derby (away to Millwall) will make sure of a play-off place if they win. Ipswich (home to Nottingham Forest) will make sure of a play-off place if they win and both Brentford (away to Reading) and Wolves (away to Wigan) fail to win. The situation at the bottom is complicated by Rotherham's three-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player. If Rotherham win,Â Wigan will be relegated if they fail to win. If Rotherham win, Millwall will be relegated if they lose. League One Preston (home to Swindon) will be promoted if they win and MK Dons (away to Rochdale) lose. Sheffield United (away to Leyton Orient) and Chesterfield (home to Bristol City) will be guaranteed play-off places with wins or if Rochdale fail to win. Leyton Orient (home to Sheff Utd) and Notts County (home to Doncaster) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe (away to Coventry) win and Crawley (away to Peterborough) avoid defeat. Colchester (away to Fleetwood) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe and Crawley win and Port Vale (away to Yeovil) avoid defeat. Jermaine Beckford (left) and Daniel Johnson celebrate; Preston can be promoted if they win and MK Dons lose Burton Albion have already been promoted but they can secure champion status this weekend League Two Already-promoted Burton (home to Northampton) will be champions if they win and Shrewsbury (away to Cheltenham) fail to win. Shrewsbury will be promoted if they win or if one of Wycombe (home to Morecambe) or Southend (home to Luton) fails to win. Stevenage (home to Carlisle) will guarantee a play-off place if they win or if one of Plymouth (home to Tranmere) or Luton fails to win. Tranmere will be relegated if they lose and if one of Hartlepool (home to Exeter) or Cheltenham win. Tranmere will also be relegated if they fail to win and Hartlepool win. Cheltenham will be relegated if they lose and Hartlepool win. ........................................................................... Conference Barnet (home to Gateshead) will be promoted as champions if they win. Bristol Rovers (home to Alfreton) will be promoted as champions if they win and Barnet fail to win. Eastleigh (home to Kidderminster) and Forest Green (home to Dover) will guarantee play-off places if they win or if Macclesfield (away to Torquay) fail to win. Macclesfield need to win and hope either Eastleigh lose or Forest Green fail to win. Barring a 14-goal swing, Alfreton will be relegated if they lose. Welling (home to Southport) will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton draw or if they draw and Alfreton win. Southport will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton win by reversing an eight-goal goal-difference deficit. It is make or break for Bristol Rovers boss Darrell Clarke this weekend - they can be promoted as champions

Summary:
derby will be promoted if they win and mk dons win over derby . derby will be promoted if they lose and leyton orient lose . derby will be promoted if they lose and leyton orient lose .

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the information provided in the article. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states, "Derby will be promoted if they win and MK Dons win over Derby." This statement is incorrect for several reasons:
   - The article does not mention any scenario where Derby County will be promoted. Instead, it states that Derby can secure a play-off spot, which is different from automatic promotion.
   - The article does not mention a match between Derby and MK Dons. Therefore, the outcome of a match between MK Dons and Derby is irrelevant to the scenarios described in the article.
   - MK Dons are mentioned in the context of League One, not the Championship, where Derby is competing. Therefore, MK Dons' results would not directly affect Derby's promotion chances.

2. The summary also states, "Derby will be promoted if they lose and Leyton Orient lose." This statement is also incorrect because:
   - Again, the article does not discuss Derby's promotion but rather their chance to secure a play-off spot.
   - Leyton Orient's results would not affect Derby's standing in the Championship as Leyton Orient is competing in League One.

3. Lastly, the summary repeats, "Derby will be promoted if they lose and Leyton Orient lose." As previously explained, this statement is incorrect and redundant.

In conclusion, the summary incorrectly claims that Derby County will be promoted under certain conditions, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions Derby's potential to secure a play-off spot in the Championship, not promotion, and it does not link Derby's outcomes to the results of MK Dons or Leyton Orient, as they are in different leagues.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Derby will be promoted if they win and MK Dons win over Derby. It also implies that Derby will be promoted if they lose and Leyton Orient lose.
2. However, the article provides information related to promotions and relegations in different football leagues, including the Championship, League One, League Two, and the Conference. It mentions that Derby will make sure of a play-off place if they win, but it does not mention anything about MK Dons. Similarly, it mentions Sheffield United and Chesterfield for play-off places but does not mention Leyton Orient. The information in the summary about Derby's promotion conditions and Leyton Orient's involvement is not supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the article provides specific information about promotions and relegations in various clubs but does not mention the specific scenarios described in the summary, which is incorrect.
