GPT4:
1. The article states that there had been concerns about whether the new owners would take on the existing workers' pension scheme. However, it goes on to say that Unite regional officer Steve Harley had productive talks with the new owners and was given guarantees that all current agreements would be honored.

2. Unite also mentioned that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004, and its members currently have an alternative pension scheme that is unaffected by the takeover.

3. The Boparan Private Office confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.

4. At no point in the article does it mention that the new owners are "dismayed" about a new pension scheme being held in the UK. In fact, the article suggests the opposite: that the new owners are committed to maintaining the current pension arrangements.

5. The summary's claim that the new owners are "dismayed" about a new pension scheme is inconsistent with the article, which indicates that the new owners have agreed to honor the existing pension arrangements and that there is no mention of a new pension scheme being introduced or causing dismay.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly suggests that the new owners are unhappy about a new pension scheme, while the article actually reports that the existing pension scheme will be maintained and does not mention any negative reactions from the new owners regarding pension arrangements.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the new owners are "dismayed" about a new pension scheme in the UK.
2. However, the article mentions that Unite, a labor union representative, had productive talks with the new owners and received guarantees that all current agreements, including pension arrangements, would be honored.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies the new owners are against the existing pension scheme, while the article states that the new owners are committed to continuing the current pension arrangements and even wish to invest in the business to make it more profitable.
