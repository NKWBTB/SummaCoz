GPT4:
1. The article states that Carlos Tevez has been told to terminate his contract with Juventus to complete a return to Boca Juniors. This is consistent with the summary.

2. The article mentions that Tevez's contract with Juventus does not expire until the end of the next season, which is also stated in the summary and is consistent.

3. The article confirms that Boca Juniors are close to completing a deal for Tevez, who is 31 years old. The summary reflects this information accurately.

4. The inconsistency arises with the phrase "he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer" in the summary. The article does not explicitly state that Tevez has told Juventus he wishes to leave. Instead, it mentions that Boca's president, Daniel Angelici, has said, "We know that he wants to return to Argentina with Boca Juniors but he must first terminate his contract with Juventus, which runs until 2016." This statement does not confirm that Tevez has directly communicated his wish to Juventus; it only acknowledges the general knowledge of his desire to return to Boca Juniors.

5. The article also includes quotes from Tevez's international manager, Tata Martino, discussing the potential move's impact on Tevez's future with the Argentina national team. However, this information is not included in the summary and does not contribute to the inconsistency.

In conclusion, the inconsistency lies in the claim that Tevez has reportedly told Juventus he wishes to leave this summer, which is not directly supported by the article. The article only indicates that there is a general understanding of his desire to return to Boca Juniors, not a direct communication of this wish to Juventus.
