GPT4:
1. The article mentions that a 24-year-old player was under contract with the Stags, which is a nickname for Mansfield Town FC. However, the summary incorrectly states that Mansfield Town have signed a player named Marcus Bignot.

2. The article actually states that Marcus Bignot's side, which refers to the team he manages, has reached an agreement to bring the 24-year-old player in on a free transfer. This means that Marcus Bignot is not the player being signed, but rather the manager who is signing the player.

3. The summary incorrectly identifies Marcus Bignot as a striker for Mansfield Town, when in fact, he is the manager of the team that the player is joining.

4. The article does not disclose any fee for the transfer, as it specifically states that the player is joining on a free transfer. The summary inaccurately mentions an undisclosed fee.

5. The summary fails to mention that the player was on loan at Crawley and scored three goals in 23 appearances, which is relevant information provided in the article.

6. The summary does not include the fact that the player will officially join on 1 January and that he is Bignot's first signing for the Mariners, which is another team, not Mansfield Town.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies Marcus Bignot as the player being signed, misstates the nature of the transfer as involving a fee rather than being a free transfer, and omits key details about the player's previous loan and the timing of the official transfer.
