Article:
Rockstar have announced the game's release has been delayed until 24 March.
The latest version of the open world adventure was due to go on sale on 27 January.
A statement from Rockstar said: "The game requires a few extra weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as can be."
"Moving a release date is never a decision we take lightly and is a choice we make only when we know it is in the best interests of the game and our fans.
"Thanks everyone for your understanding and we assure you these few extra weeks will be worth it when the game does arrive in March."
It's not all bad news though. The company announced that eagerly-awaited online heists are coming to consoles before the PC release date.
Screenshots from the PC version of GTA V have been released, with Rockstar promising "even greater levels of detail".
Los Santos and Blaine County will be visible in 1080p at 60fps, with up to 4K resolution and support for up to triple monitor configurations.
While you're waiting for the game to be released you can make sure your PC is up to scratch.
Minimum specifications required to run GTA V have also been published.
Grand Theft Auto V became the fastest-selling entertainment product ever when it was released on 17 September 2013, taking just three days to generate $1bn (Â£620m) in revenue.

Summary:
vlogtarter has released details of its latest version of rocks, which will be released this month.

GPT4:
1. The article is about Rockstar, the video game company, and their announcement regarding the delay of their game's release date. The summary incorrectly refers to "vlogtarter," which is not mentioned anywhere in the article. This is a clear inconsistency as it seems to be a misrepresentation of the company name "Rockstar."

2. The summary states that the latest version of "rocks" will be released this month. The article, however, specifies that the release of the latest version of the open world adventure game (implied to be Grand Theft Auto V) has been delayed until 24 March. The summary's claim contradicts the new release date provided in the article.

3. The summary does not mention the game by name, but the article is specifically about Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). The omission of the game's name in the summary is a significant detail that is inconsistent with the article's content.

4. The summary fails to capture the key points of the article, such as the delay being due to the need for additional testing and polish, the introduction of online heists for consoles, the release of PC version screenshots, and the enhanced features for the PC version like 1080p at 60fps and up to 4K resolution.

5. The summary does not reflect the article's mention of the historical sales achievement of Grand Theft Auto V, which became the fastest-selling entertainment product ever in 2013.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it misidentifies the company name, inaccurately states the release timing, omits the name of the game, and fails to include key details about the game's delay, features, and historical significance.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that vlogtarter has released details of its latest version of rocks.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about vlogstarter nor rocks.
3. Instead, the article is about the delay of the release of Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) from Rockstar.
