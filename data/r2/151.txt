GPT4:
The summary contains several points that need to be checked against the article for consistency:

1. "Noah Thomas, from Dublin, has widened since he was first went missing." - This sentence is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense. The correct information from the article is that the search for Noah Thomas has widened since he first went missing.

2. "The four-foot, 60lb redheaded child's mother saw the boy at 9am but went back to bed." - This is consistent with the article, which states that Noah's mother saw him at 9am before she went back to bed.

3. "A ground search continued overnight on Sunday and expanded to include more than 100 members." - This is consistent with the article, which mentions that the ground search continued overnight on Sunday and included more than 100 members of Virginia law enforcement.

4. "He has been missing for two days after being seen watching cartoons Sunday morning." - This is inconsistent with the article. The article does not specify that he has been missing for two days; it only mentions that he was last seen on Sunday morning. The duration of his disappearance is not clearly stated in the article.

5. "Search crews have looked around the boy's house, where his mother saw him." - This is consistent with the article, which states that search crews have looked around the boy's house.

The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement about the duration of Noah's disappearance, which is not specified in the article. The summary incorrectly asserts that he has been missing for two days, while the article does not provide that detail.
