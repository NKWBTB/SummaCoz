GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is that it incorrectly states that "new England manager Sam Allardyce has announced his retirement from international football." The article does not mention Sam Allardyce retiring from international football. Instead, it discusses a player's retirement, not Sam Allardyce's. Here are the steps to identify the inconsistency:

1. The article talks about a "former Manchester City man," who is 30 years old and has won 61 caps for England, announcing his retirement. The summary does not mention this player at all.

2. The article mentions Sam Allardyce in a quote attributed to the retiring player, indicating that the player wishes Sam Allardyce success in the future. This implies that Sam Allardyce is in a position of leadership, likely as the manager of the England team, and is not the one retiring.

3. The article specifies that the player retiring has been a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships and has a record for the most capped England Under-21 player. This information is about the player's career and not about Sam Allardyce.

4. The summary incorrectly attributes the retirement to Sam Allardyce, while the article clearly states that it is the player, not Sam Allardyce, who has made the decision to retire from international football.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it misidentifies the subject of the retirement announcement. The article is about a player's retirement, while the summary incorrectly claims that it is Sam Allardyce, the England manager, who has retired.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Sam Allardyce, the new England manager, has announced his retirement from international football.
2. However, the article states that it is James Milner, the former Manchester City player, who is retiring from international football. There is no mention of Sam Allardyce retiring from international football in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly attributes the retirement to Sam Allardyce instead of James Milner, the subject of the article.
