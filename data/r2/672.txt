Summary:
a lollipop lady has been blinded in a ``world upside down\'\'after admitting causing the death of a lollipop lady, a court has heard.

GPT4:
1. The article states that Sylvia Blackburn, the lollipop lady, suffered serious head injuries, not that she was blinded. The summary incorrectly states that the lollipop lady has been blinded.

2. The article does not mention that Sylvia Blackburn has died. The summary incorrectly states that someone has admitted to causing the death of a lollipop lady.

3. The person on trial, Brian Wright, admitted to striking Mrs. Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The summary incorrectly suggests that Mr. Wright admitted to causing the death of Mrs. Blackburn.

4. The phrase "world upside down" is used in the article, but it is in reference to Mr. Wright's statement about how he felt he had turned Sylvia Blackburn's world upside down, not that she had been blinded or had died.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately claims that the lollipop lady was blinded and that there was an admission of causing her death, neither of which are supported by the information in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a lollipop lady has been blinded in a "world upside down" after admitting causing the death of a lollipop lady.
2. However, the article does not mention that anyone has been blinded or that a lollipop lady has admitted causing the death of another lollipop lady. The article primarily discusses an accident involving Brian Wright, who is accused of causing serious injury to Sylvia Blackburn, a lollipop lady, and denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The article does not mention any death or a lollipop lady admitting to causing another lollipop lady's death.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces incorrect information about blindness, a lollipop lady's admission of causing death, and a "world upside down," which is not supported by the article.
