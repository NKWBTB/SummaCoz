GPT4:
1. The article mentions that the match discussed took place in Greater Noida, which is in India. This aligns with the summary stating that the match was in India.

2. The article states that the sides (Ireland and Afghanistan) are scheduled to meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday. This implies that the match discussed in the article is the first T20 match of the series, not the second as stated in the summary.

3. The article does not specify which match in the series this was, but the mention of a future second T20 match indicates that the match in the article must be the first one.

4. The summary incorrectly states that Ireland lost to Afghanistan in the second of the three-match Twenty20 series, while the article implies it was the first match by mentioning a future second match.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the summary's incorrect reference to the match as the second in the series when the article implies it was the first match.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Ireland lost to Afghanistan in the second of the three-match Twenty20 series in India on Tuesday.
2. However, the article provides details of a cricket match between Ireland and Afghanistan but does not specify the format as a Twenty20 match, and it does not mention the specific date of Tuesday. The article does not provide information about this being the second match of a three-match series, and it does not specify the location as India.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies specific details about the format of the match, the day it occurred, and its place, which are not supported by the article's content. The article provides general information about a cricket match but lacks the specific details mentioned in the summary.
