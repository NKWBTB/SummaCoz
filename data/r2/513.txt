GPT4:
1. The article discusses a football player who has retired from international football, but it does not mention the player's first name. The summary, however, refers to the player as "Adam Milner."

2. To verify the consistency of the summary with the article, we need to check if the name "Adam Milner" is indeed the correct name of the player mentioned in the article.

3. The article refers to the player as "the former Manchester City man" and "Milner," but does not provide a first name. This means we cannot confirm from the article alone that the player's first name is Adam.

4. A quick fact-check outside of the article's information reveals that the football player who fits the description provided (former Manchester City player, England international with 61 caps, debuted in 2009, played at two World Cups and two European Championships, most capped England Under-21 player, scored in a 5-0 victory over Moldova) is James Milner, not Adam Milner.

5. Therefore, the inconsistency in the summary is the incorrect first name given to the player. The summary should refer to the player as "James Milner" rather than "Adam Milner."

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that former England midfielder Adam Milner has announced his retirement from international football.

The article provides some information about the player's international career, but it doesn't specifically state that Adam Milner has announced his retirement from international football.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a specific name (Adam Milner) that is not mentioned in the article.
