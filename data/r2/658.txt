GPT4:
The summary provided does not actually summarize the article; instead, it is a repetitive string of the phrases "oscar-winning" and "oscar winner." A proper summary should encapsulate the key points from the article in a coherent and concise manner. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the inconsistencies:

1. The summary does not mention the name of the star who will play Mrs. Potts, which is a significant detail from the article.

2. The summary does not reference the 1991 animated version of the film or Dame Angela Lansbury, who originally voiced Mrs. Potts, both of which are mentioned in the article.

3. The summary fails to mention Kevin Kline, who has been cast as Maurice, or any of the other actors and their roles, such as Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as the Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, and Josh Gad as LeFou.

4. The summary does not include the release date of the film, which is 17 March 2017, as stated in the article.

5. The summary omits the name of the director, Bill Condon, and any mention of the film's production details, such as the filming location at Shepperton Studios and the start date in May.

6. The summary does not even clarify that it is discussing a film or the title of the film, which is "Beauty and the Beast."

In conclusion, the summary provided is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article and lacks any meaningful information about the film's cast, release date, director, or production details.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states a repetition of the phrases "oscar-winning" and "oscar winner" followed by "actress."
2. However, the article provides information about the casting for Disney's live-action adaptation of "Beauty and the Beast," including the roles various actors are playing. It mentions Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad in their respective roles. There is no repetition of the phrase "oscar-winning" or "oscar winner" in the article, and it doesn't specify which actress is being referred to with these terms.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary repeatedly mentioning "oscar-winning" and "oscar winner" without connecting these phrases to any specific actress or actor, while the article provides clear information about the cast of the movie.
