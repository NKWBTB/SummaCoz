Article:
Officials believe Lawrence Phillips, 40, killed himself early on Wednesday.
In the 1990s, he was a star player at the University of Nebraska, making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL.
Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field.
After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law.
Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers.
In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend.
Phillips, who was serving a term of more than 30 years, had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate.
On Tuesday, a judge found that there was enough evidence to try Phillips in the death of Damion Soward, 37.
It is unclear how he took his own life.
"He was an intelligent person and had some good qualities," Tom Osborne, his coach at Nebraska, told the Associated Press news agency.
"Yet he had some anger issues and couldn't overcome the demons in his life.''

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The name "Tom Phillips" is mentioned in the summary, but the article is about Lawrence Phillips. There is no mention of a "Tom Phillips" in the article.

2. The summary states that the individual was jailed for three years, but the article mentions that Lawrence Phillips was serving a term of more than 30 years, not three.

3. The summary claims the assault was on an American football player, but the article specifies that Phillips was convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers and for assaulting a former girlfriend. There is no mention of the assault being specifically on an American football player.

4. The summary does not mention the suicide, which is a significant event reported in the article.

5. The summary incorrectly refers to Tom Osborne as "Tom Phillips." Tom Osborne is actually the coach who spoke about Lawrence Phillips in the article, not the person who was jailed.

Each of these points demonstrates that the summary is not consistent with the information provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Tom Phillips was jailed for three years for assaulting an American football player, but the article does not mention anything about Tom Phillips being jailed or assaulting anyone.
