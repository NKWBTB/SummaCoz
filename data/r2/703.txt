We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said.Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015).A council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence."The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals.

GPT4:
The summary provided does not accurately reflect the content of the article for several reasons:

1. The article does not mention "six residential homes in Southampton are facing eviction." The article discusses the issue of unlicensed Houses of Multiple Occupation (HMOs) and does not specify any particular number of homes facing eviction.

2. The summary states that the evictions are "because of a shortage of council tenants," which is not mentioned or implied anywhere in the article. The article talks about landlords being put off by the cost of obtaining a license for HMOs and the potential fines for not complying, not about a shortage of council tenants.

3. The source of the information in the summary is attributed to the BBC ("the BBC has learned"), but the article does not mention the BBC as a source of any information regarding evictions or a shortage of council tenants.

4. The article does mention concerns about eviction and living in poorly maintained properties, but these concerns are raised by HMO tenants, not because of a shortage of council tenants. The article also highlights the issue of unregulated rented homes due to a shortage of affordable housing, not a shortage of council tenants.

5. The article provides specific information about the licensing requirements for HMOs, the areas affected by the licensing designations, and the actions taken by Southampton City Council, none of which are reflected in the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it introduces information about evictions and a shortage of council tenants that is not present in the article, and it fails to accurately represent the main points discussed in the article regarding HMO licensing and related tenant concerns.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that six residential homes in Southampton are facing eviction due to a shortage of council tenants.
2. However, the article does not mention any specific residential homes in Southampton facing eviction, and it does not attribute this situation to a shortage of council tenants. The article discusses the need for landlords to obtain House of Multiple Occupation (HMO) licenses and the concerns of HMO tenants but does not provide the information presented in the summary.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the article implies specific residential homes are facing eviction because of a shortage of council tenants, while the summary states that this is the case without supporting details from the article.
