GPT4:
The summary provided is not consistent with the article because it does not actually summarize the content of the article. Instead, it is a repetitive string of the phrases "oscar-winning" and "oscar winner" with no context or reference to the specific individuals or the roles they are playing in the film. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the inconsistencies:

1. The summary does not mention the name of the star who will play Mrs. Potts, nor does it acknowledge Dame Angela Lansbury, who originally voiced the character in the 1991 animated version.

2. The summary fails to mention Kevin Kline, who is an Oscar-winner mentioned in the article as having signed on to play Maurice.

3. The summary does not provide any information about the release date of the film, which is stated in the article as 17 March 2017.

4. Emma Watson, who is cast as Belle, is not mentioned in the summary. Although she is not an Oscar-winner, her casting is a significant detail in the article.

5. The summary does not mention Dan Stevens or Luke Evans, who are confirmed to play the Beast and Gaston, respectively.

6. Josh Gad's involvement in the film as LeFou is omitted from the summary.

7. The director of the movie, Bill Condon, is not mentioned in the summary, nor is the information about the filming location and start date.

In conclusion, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it does not provide any meaningful information about the film, the cast, the director, or the production details. It is simply a nonsensical repetition of the terms "oscar-winning" and "oscar winner," which does not convey the actual substance of the article.

HUMAN:
1. The first red flag is the repeated use of the phrase "Oscar-winning" in the summary. The article only mentions that the actors have won Oscars once, but the summary exaggerates this by repeating the phrase multiple times.
2. The second red flag is the lack of specific information about the actors' roles in the summary. The article provides detailed information about each actor's role, but the summary only mentions the actors' names without any context.
3. The fourth red flag is the lack of information about the film's release date. The article mentions that the film will be released on March 17, 2017, but the summary does not include this information.
