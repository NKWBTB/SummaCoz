Summary:
defending champion novak djokovic suffered a surprise defeat by juan martin del potro in the first round of the rogers cup in toronto.

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies when compared to the article:

1. The article does not mention the Rogers Cup or that the match between Djokovic and Del Potro was in the first round of that tournament. Instead, it refers to Djokovic's loss in the singles at the Olympics to Juan Martin del Potro, which is a separate event from the Rogers Cup.

2. The article states that Djokovic won his 30th Masters title in Toronto before the Olympics, which implies that he did not suffer a defeat in the first round of the Rogers Cup as the summary suggests.

3. The term "defending champion" is not used in the article, and there is no information provided about Djokovic defending a title at the time of the mentioned events.

4. The summary focuses solely on a supposed event at the Rogers Cup, while the article discusses Djokovic's performance at the Olympics and his previous loss at Wimbledon, as well as his victory in Toronto.

In conclusion, the summary incorrectly associates Djokovic's defeat with the Rogers Cup in Toronto and inaccurately describes the circumstances of his loss to Del Potro, which according to the article, occurred at the Olympics and not at the Rogers Cup.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Novak Djokovic suffered a surprise defeat by Juan Martin del Potro in the first round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto, but the article states that Djokovic suffered a surprise third-round defeat at Wimbledon in July when he lost to American Sam Querre. Thus, Djokovic lost in third-round, not first round.
2. The summary states that Novak Djokovic suffered a defeat in the the Rogers Cup in Toronto, but the article does not mention anything about Djokovic playing in Toronto or rogers cup.
