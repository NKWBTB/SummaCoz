GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement that "Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam." This statement implies that the name Sam is a strong contender for the second royal baby's name based on the influence of Sam Waley-Cohen, the jockey. However, the article does not state that the royal couple is considering the name Sam for their baby. Instead, it explains that bookmakers have slashed the odds on the name Sam following Sam Waley-Cohen's success at Aintree and his connection to the royal couple, not because the couple has shown any preference for the name.

The article mentions that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have not publicly disclosed the sex of their second child and that they do not know it themselves. The summary's reference to "Prince George's brother or sister" is not incorrect, but it misleadingly suggests that the name Sam is a likely choice for the baby, which is not supported by the article.

The article also provides information about other names with better odds according to bookmakers, such as Alice, Elizabeth, and Charlotte, which are not mentioned in the summary. The summary's focus on the name Sam gives the impression that it is a frontrunner, which is not corroborated by the details in the article that indicate other names are favored.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it implies that the royal couple is considering the name Sam for their second child based on the influence of Sam Waley-Cohen, while the article only discusses the betting odds and the jockey's connection to the couple without any indication from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge that they are leaning towards this name.
