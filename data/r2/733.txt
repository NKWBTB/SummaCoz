Tim Sherwood has urged Aston Villa to man up as he labelled their clash with relegation rivals QPR the club's 'biggest game' for years. They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown.

'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here. 'Listen, I know I am biased - he has been good for me and I have been good for him. But he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen.'

Summary:

GPT4:
The summary contains several points that are inconsistent with the information provided in the article:

1. The summary states that "Aston Villa host Rangers at the bottom of the Premier League on Tuesday." However, the article does not mention that Aston Villa is at the bottom of the Premier League. Instead, it states that Villa is in 17th place, which implies that there are teams below them in the league standings.

2. The summary also claims that "Tim Sherwood's side will return to bottom three with a better goal difference." This statement is confusing and contradictory. The article mentions that a victory for Aston Villa would move them five points clear of the relegation zone, but if QPR (who are three points behind with a better goal difference) win, then Villa would return to the bottom three. The summary incorrectly suggests that Aston Villa has a better goal difference, which is not supported by the article.

3. Lastly, the summary repeats the information about the match taking place on Tuesday, which is correct, but it does not add any new information or context from the article, making it redundant.

In summary, the inconsistencies are that the article does not state Aston Villa is at the bottom of the Premier League, and the summary incorrectly suggests that Aston Villa has a better goal difference when the article actually says QPR has the better goal difference.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Aston Villa hosts Rangers at the bottom of the Premier League on Tuesday.
2. However, the article discusses a crucial match between Aston Villa and QPR, with Tim Sherwood emphasizing the importance of this game for Villa's Premier League survival. It doesn't mention Rangers, and there is no indication that the match will take place at the bottom of the Premier League. The summary incorrectly introduces the term "bottom of the Premier League" and mentions Rangers, which is not part of the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces information not present in the article, including the mention of Rangers and the phrase "bottom of the Premier League." The article primarily focuses on the significance of the match for Aston Villa in the context of the Premier League relegation battle.
