GPT4:
The summary contains several instances of the word "UNK," which seems to be a placeholder for missing or unrecognized text. This suggests that the summary may have been generated by an automated system that encountered words or names it could not process. The use of "UNK" does not provide the actual names or details that are present in the article, such as the name of the abusive commenter ('fatalsplash') and the full name of Rickie Fowler's girlfriend (Alexis Randock). 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the inconsistencies:

1. The summary refers to "rickie fowler , girlfriend , bikini model alexis UNK" - The "UNK" here fails to include the last name of Rickie Fowler's girlfriend, which is "Randock" as mentioned in the article.

2. The summary mentions "an abusive commenter known as ' UNK '" - The "UNK" does not convey the actual username of the commenter, which is 'fatalsplash' according to the article.

3. The summary does not capture the essence of the interaction between Rickie Fowler, his girlfriend Alexis Randock, and the commenter 'fatalsplash.' It omits the details of the exchange, including Fowler's defense of his girlfriend and the subsequent backtracking of the commenter.

4. The summary does not mention the positive support Rickie Fowler received from other posters, nor does it include Alexis's response to the troll, both of which are important elements of the article.

In conclusion, the use of "UNK" in the summary indicates missing information and results in a lack of consistency with the article, as it leaves out critical names and details of the incident described.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Rickie Fowler's girlfriend, Alexis Randock, posted a photo on her Instagram account of her and her sister on the beach last week, which was shared with her 25,000 followers.
2. However, the article states that the photo was posted by Alexis Randock, the bikini model, and that an abusive commenter known as 'fatalsplash' accused her of being a 'gold digger.' It was not Rickie Fowler who posted the photo but his girlfriend.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary attributes the act of posting the photo to Rickie Fowler, while the article correctly attributes it to Alexis Randock, his girlfriend.
