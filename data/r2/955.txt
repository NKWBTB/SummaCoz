Article:
There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.  Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans. The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium .

Summary:
Doncaster Rovers drew 0-0 with Fleetwood Town at the Keepmoat Stadium . The Yorkshire side are rooted to the bottom of League One . Doncaster 's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights . So they made it short and sweet , just 27 seconds in fact .

GPT4:
1. The article states that Doncaster Rovers are "firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One." This contradicts the summary's claim that "The Yorkshire side are rooted to the bottom of League One." Being in mid-table mediocrity implies that they are in the middle of the standings, not at the bottom.

2. The summary correctly mentions that Doncaster Rovers drew 0-0 with Fleetwood Town at the Keepmoat Stadium, which is consistent with the article.

3. The summary also correctly states that Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compiling the match highlights, which is supported by the article's description of the media team's dilemma in creating an engaging highlights video from a goalless draw.

4. The summary accurately reflects the article's information about the length of the highlights video, mentioning that it was "just 27 seconds in fact," which is consistent with the article's description.

The inconsistency lies in the incorrect position of Doncaster Rovers in the league standings as mentioned in the summary. The article does not indicate that they are at the bottom of League One, but rather in a mid-table position.
