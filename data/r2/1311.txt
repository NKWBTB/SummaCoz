Article:
Clarkson, 30, joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
He scored nine goals at Dundee last season and has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term.
"I'm ready, I've been fit all season and I'm as fit as I've ever been," Clarkson told the St Mirren website.
"I've been playing games, playing for the U20s and I like to keep my match fitness up.
"I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit and hopefully up to speed with everyone else really. I'm looking forward to getting started."
Capped twice for Scotland in 2008 and with one international goal to his name, Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level.
His previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.
St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa.
"Obviously the game on Saturday, every game is a big game, and the more games we can win the more confidence we can get from that we can hopefully go on a run of games and push up the table and try to get the club back to where it has been," added Clarkson.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses a player named Clarkson who has joined St Mirren, not Bristol Rovers. There is no mention of a loan deal with Brentford in the article.

2. The article states that Clarkson has previously played for Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers, but it does not indicate any current transaction or loan involving these teams.

3. Clarkson is mentioned as preparing for a debut with St Mirren in the Championship against Alloa, which suggests that he is currently associated with St Mirren, not Bristol Rovers or Brentford.

4. The summary introduces the name "Jeremy Clarkson," but the article does not mention the first name of the player. It only refers to him as Clarkson.

5. The summary claims that Clarkson is on loan until the end of the season, but the article does not provide any information about the duration of Clarkson's contract or any loan agreement.

Based on these points, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately represents Clarkson's current club affiliation, the nature of his move (permanent transfer vs. loan), and his current team's name. It also introduces a first name that is not provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Bristol Rovers have signed striker Jeremy Clarkson on loan from Brentford.
