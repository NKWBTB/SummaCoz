GPT4:
1. The summary states that "the lion died while it was being transported to hospital." However, the article does not mention that the mountain lion was being transported to a hospital. It only states that the lion died while it was being transported to another location for public safety after being tranquilized.

2. The summary correctly mentions that the three-year-old mountain lion was seen outside of Macy's at the Promenade Mall in Temecula and that a game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart.

3. The summary also correctly states that the Riverside Sheriff's Department contacted the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

4. The summary repeats the information about the game warden shooting the lion with a tranquilizer dart and moving it to the bed of a pickup truck, which is consistent with the article.

The inconsistency lies in the claim that the mountain lion was being transported to a hospital, which is not supported by the information provided in the article. The article only mentions transportation to another location for public safety, not to a hospital.

HUMAN:
1. The summary the three-year-old was seen outside of the macy's promenade in temecula at about 6am, but it didn't mention it is the mountain lion was seen outside, without mentioning the mountain lion just stating three-year-old, that would be misleading as it could be three-year-old people.
