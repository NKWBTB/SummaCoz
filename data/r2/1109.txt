GPT4:
The summary states that the Belfast Giants beat the Nottingham Panthers 4-2 away to win the Elite League title on Saturday night. However, the article does not mention that this particular game was the title-winning game for the Elite League. It simply reports the score and some details of the game, such as who scored the goals.

Additionally, the article mentions that the teams are set to meet again on Saturday night in the second match of their double-header, which implies that the game described in the article did not take place on a Saturday night, or at least that the outcome of the league title was not decided by this game alone.

Furthermore, the article provides the league standings, stating that Nottingham leads the league with 28 points, followed by Sheffield Steelers with 27 points and Belfast with 25 points. This information suggests that the league is still ongoing and that the title has not yet been won, as Belfast is not leading in points.

Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly claims that the game resulted in Belfast winning the Elite League title, which is not supported by any information in the article.
