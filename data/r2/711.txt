GPT4:
1. The summary states that the restoration project is for "Haringey theatre," but the article does not mention a "Haringey theatre." Instead, it refers to the restoration of the theatre at Alexandra Palace.

2. The cost of the restoration project in the summary is listed as "£1.8m," which is inconsistent with the figures provided in the article. The article states that the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) is contributing £18.8m, Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m, and the total cost of refurbishing the entire east wing is £26.6m. Additionally, the Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust is committed to raising the final £1m.

3. The summary implies that the project is to be launched, suggesting it is in the future. However, the article indicates that the fundraising and restoration efforts are already underway, with the hope of reopening the theatre in 2018.

4. The summary does not capture the full scope of the project as described in the article. The article mentions that the restoration includes not just the theatre but also the BBC studios, the glazed east court, and the entire east wing of Alexandra Palace.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it misstates the name of the theatre, the cost of the restoration project, the timeline, and the scope of the project.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that there is a £1.8 million restoration project to transform the east end of Haringey Theatre into a theatre.
2. However, the article does not mention a specific £1.8 million restoration project for the east end of Haringey Theatre. The article primarily discusses the restoration of Alexandra Palace's theatre, which is located in North London, and the funds allocated for this project.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces unrelated information about Haringey Theatre and a specific budget not found in the article.
