There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

Summary:
the scottish government has been accused of ``burying the size of taxation\'\'by the scottish government.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which is examining the current council tax system and considering alternatives. It mentions that the council tax has inherent problems and that reform is a complex process.

2. The article quotes Prof Kenneth Gibb, who reviewed different systems of local taxation and discussed the pros and cons of property taxes and local income taxes. He concludes that there is no simple solution or "magic bullet" to the issues with the current system.

3. The article also mentions that the commission will hold a public consultation and that the Scottish government, along with local government partners, has established the Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives to the current council tax system.

4. The Scottish government spokesman is quoted as saying that the government considers the current council tax system to be unfair and is awaiting the commission's report, which is due in the autumn.

5. The summary, however, states that "the scottish government has been accused of 'burying the size of taxation' by the scottish government." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons:

   - The article does not contain any accusations against the Scottish government for "burying the size of taxation."
   - The phrase "burying the size of taxation" is not mentioned anywhere in the article.
   - The summary incorrectly suggests that the Scottish government is accusing itself, which is nonsensical and not supported by the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces an accusation that is not present in the article and misrepresents the Scottish government's position and actions regarding the council tax system.

HUMAN:
1. The summary accuses the Scottish government of "burying the size of taxation."
2. However, the article does not contain any statement or information that directly accuses the Scottish government of burying the size of taxation. It primarily discusses a review by the Commission on Local Tax Reform and the challenges associated with the council tax system.
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of the specific accusation against the Scottish government, which is not supported by the article's content. The article does not make such an accusation.
