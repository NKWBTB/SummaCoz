Article:
Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Emmanuel Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane." This is consistent with the article, which mentions the same information about Adebayor's contract situation.

2. The summary also mentions that "Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City on loan." This is consistent with the article, which states that he joined Tottenham initially on loan before the move was made permanent.

3. The inconsistency arises with the statement "the Togo international posted a video of him dancing in the Arc de Triomphe." The article specifies that Adebayor posted a video of himself dancing in front of the Arc de Triomphe, not in it. Dancing inside the Arc de Triomphe would likely be impossible or at least highly unusual, given that it is a monument with restricted access for such activities. The preposition "in" suggests he was inside the structure, which is not what the article conveys. The correct preposition should be "in front of," as used in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Emmanuel Adebayor has one year left on his current contract at White Hart Lane, joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City on loan, and posted a video of himself dancing in the Arc de Triomphe.
2. However, the article mentions that Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 initially on loan, and after an impressive first season, the club made the switch permanent for £5 million the following summer. The article does not specify the remaining duration of Adebayor's contract. Additionally, while the article talks about Adebayor's recent bizarre dance video in front of the Arc de Triomphe, it does not mention any specific details about his contract status.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary states specific details about Adebayor's contract duration and loan status that are not explicitly mentioned or confirmed in the article.
