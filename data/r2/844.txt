A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday as part of what began with a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington. Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday." However, the article specifies that the guard was "shot and critically wounded," but it does not confirm the guard's death. The inconsistency lies in the summary's claim that the guard died, which is not supported by the information provided in the article.

2. The summary mentions that the incident was "part of a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington." The article does mention a suspect and a couple fighting in a car, but it does not explicitly state that the suspect was kidnapping his own wife. This detail is not supported by the article and adds an assumption that is not confirmed.

3. The summary correctly states that "the shooter had instead taken some officers on a wild chase back into D.C.," which is consistent with the article's description of the events.

4. The summary also correctly mentions that "the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once," which aligns with the article's account of the shooter's actions.

The main inconsistency is the claim of the guard's death, which is not corroborated by the article. Additionally, the detail about the suspect kidnapping his own wife is not supported by the information in the article and introduces an unverified element to the summary.
