Summary:
one in five parents in england eat vegetables at home, a survey suggests.

GPT4:
The summary provided states that "one in five parents in England eat vegetables at home," which is not consistent with the information presented in the article for several reasons:

1. The article does not provide any statistics or information about the dietary habits of parents at home, specifically regarding their vegetable consumption. The focus of the article is on the children's eating habits, not the parents'.

2. The article discusses a survey about children's experiences with school lunches and how these lunches have influenced the children to try new foods, including vegetables, that they have not tried at home. It mentions that four out of five children who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home, but this statistic is about children's experiences, not parents'.

3. The survey mentioned in the article is about the impact of school meals on children's eating habits and preferences. It discusses the types of vegetables that are popular among children and those that are less popular, as well as the influence of school meals on children's requests for certain foods at home. There is no mention of the proportion of parents who eat vegetables at home.

4. The summary's claim is not supported by any data or statements in the article. The article's focus is on the positive impact of school meals on children's willingness to try new foods and the variety of their diets, not on the vegetable consumption habits of parents.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes a statistic about children's eating habits to parents and does not accurately reflect the content of the article, which does not address the vegetable consumption of parents at all.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that one in five parents in England eat vegetables at home, according to a survey.
2. However, the article discusses a survey conducted among parents in England regarding their children's eating habits, not the parents' vegetable consumption. The survey found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. It also mentions the popularity of different vegetables among children and their school lunch experiences.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which misinterprets the survey's focus on children's food experiences and their preferences, not the eating habits of parents.
