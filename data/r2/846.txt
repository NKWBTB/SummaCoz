A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday as part of what began with a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington. Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city. Scroll down for video Critical: A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA.

According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C. The barricade caused a collision between the suspect's car and a police cruiser, NBC reports. The suspect was shot several times. Two police officers were also wounded in the showdown, but reportedly had non-life threatening injuries.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "police believe the shooter had barricaded himself inside after noticing a couple fighting in a car." This is inconsistent with the article, which actually reports that authorities initially thought the shooter had barricaded himself inside the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters but he had not. Instead, the shooter led police on a chase back into Washington, D.C.

2. The article mentions that the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car, but it does not say that the shooter barricaded himself inside as a result of this observation. The barricade situation is mentioned separately and is related to the initial response by authorities to the shooting, not directly to the shooter's actions following his observation of the couple.

3. The summary incorrectly combines two separate events: the guard noticing a couple fighting and the authorities' belief that the shooter had barricaded himself. These are presented as sequential in the summary, but the article does not support this sequence of events.

4. The article clearly states that the shooter was eventually shot on a busy Northeast Washington street after a car chase, which contradicts the summary's implication that the shooter barricaded himself after the initial incident at the Census Bureau.

5. The summary correctly mentions that the shooter may be tied to another shooting in the Southeast quadrant of the city, which is a detail also provided in the article. However, this is the only part of the summary that is consistent with the article.
