Article:
The 10-year-old Irish-bred horse collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.He was treated by veterinary staff before being pronounced dead.The British Horseracing Authority confirmed the horse suffered from a "severe pulmonary haemorrhage".Tony Welsh, acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, said: "Episodes such as this are rare, and can occur in horses which have no underlying health issues, and amongst all disciplines of sport horses."In spite of the rarity of these incidents, as a sport we are determined to do more to understand what causes these symptoms, and whether more can be done to prevent it."In Saturday's race, King George winner Thistlecrack caught Many Clouds close to the finish but the Trevor Hemmings-owned gelding, ridden by Leighton Aspell, fought back to win.Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, which had seen him over-heat and "wobble" on his feet, but the horse had never collapsed before, and had shown no symptoms of post-race ataxia on Saturday.Many Clouds had previously won the Gold Cup trial in 2015 and the Hennessy Gold Cup in 2014.Trainer Oliver Sherwood described him as the "horse of a lifetime".BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius LysaghtThe crucial words here are "no significant underlying health issues".On more than one occasion, notably after his Grand National success, Many Clouds received treatment for a tendency to 'overheat', but he soon recovered, and his welfare was closely monitored by the authorities as a result.With that fact in mind, questions have been raised as to whether that condition was linked to his death, but this report concludes he was the victim of a haemorrhage rarely seen on the racetrack.

Summary:
a horse died after being hit by a horse in cheltenham, a trainer has said.

GPT4:
The summary states that "a horse died after being hit by a horse in Cheltenham," which suggests that the horse's death was the result of physical trauma caused by another horse during the event. However, the article does not mention any such incident. Instead, it explains that the horse, Many Clouds, collapsed and died after narrowly winning the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. The cause of death was confirmed by the British Horseracing Authority as a "severe pulmonary haemorrhage," which is an internal bleeding condition, not an injury caused by being hit by another horse.

Furthermore, the article details that Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, which involved overheating and wobbling, but there is no mention of the horse ever being hit by another horse. The article also includes a statement from Tony Welsh, the acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, discussing the rarity of such episodes and the determination to understand and prevent them, which further supports the conclusion that the death was due to a medical condition, not an external impact.

Lastly, the trainer, Oliver Sherwood, is quoted as describing Many Clouds as the "horse of a lifetime," but there is no mention of him saying anything about the horse being hit by another horse.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the summary's incorrect claim that the horse died after being hit by another horse, while the article clearly states that the death was due to a severe pulmonary haemorrhage, with no mention of any physical altercation with another horse.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that a horse died after being hit by a horse in Cheltenham, as per what a trainer has said.
2. However, the article reports that the horse, named Many Clouds, collapsed and died after narrowly beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. There is no mention in the article of the horse being "hit by a horse." The horse's death is attributed to a "severe pulmonary haemorrhage."
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that the horse died from being hit by another horse, whereas the article provides a different cause of death, a severe pulmonary haemorrhage, which is unrelated to being hit by another horse.
