He was first-team coach when Ally McCoist succeeded Smith in 2011, then returned to working with the youths again after McCoist resigned during season 2014-15.

Summary:

GPT4:
The summary states that "Rangers have confirmed the appointment of manager Paul Durrant to remain as manager at the end of the season." However, the article does not mention any confirmation of Paul Durrant being appointed as manager or remaining in that position. Instead, the article provides information that contradicts the summary:

1. The article states that Durrant "spent last season in charge of the Under-20 development squad," which indicates that he was not the manager of the main team.

2. It is mentioned that "Rangers manager Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel," which implies that Warburton is the current manager, not Durrant.

3. The article also says that Durrant "will not return for the start of pre-season training," which contradicts the idea of him being appointed or remaining as manager.

4. The article outlines Durrant's history with Rangers, noting that he "held several positions in the youth set-up" and was "first-team coach when Ally McCoist succeeded Smith in 2011," but it does not state that he was ever the manager of the main team.

5. Lastly, the article mentions that Durrant "returned to working with the youths again after McCoist resigned during season 2014-15," which further supports the fact that he was not in the role of the main team manager.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies Paul Durrant as being appointed to remain as manager, while the article clearly indicates that he was involved with the Under-20 development squad and is not returning to the coaching staff due to changes made by the current manager, Mark Warburton.
