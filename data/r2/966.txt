Let's analyze the summary step by step and compare it with the information provided in the article:

1. "Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion."
   - This statement is consistent with the article, which mentions that Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Brom.

2. "Swansea host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety."
   - This statement is not consistent with the article. The article states that Leicester, not Swansea, is hosting Swansea on Saturday. Additionally, the article implies that it is Leicester who is three points from safety, not Swansea.

3. "West Brom are bottom of the table."
   - This statement is not consistent with the article. The article clearly states that Leicester remains bottom of the table, not West Brom.

4. "Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs."
   - This statement is consistent with the article. Nigel Pearson, the Leicester manager, is quoted as wanting his side to focus on their own games and not get involved in anything else.

In summary, the inconsistencies in the summary are related to the incorrect identification of the team hosting the match (Leicester, not Swansea) and the incorrect team being at the bottom of the table (Leicester, not West Brom).
