There's a lack of pace, and a different mindset when they go away from home. They have to improve and quickly."

Summary:
chelsea boss mauricio pochettino says his side need to be ready to challenge for the premier league title after a 2-1 draw at tottenham

GPT4:
1. The article discusses a match where Sadio Mane scored twice for his team, which is not specified in the summary. However, the summary incorrectly states that the match ended in a 2-1 draw at Tottenham.

2. The article mentions that Spurs (Tottenham Hotspur) disappointed at Anfield, which implies that the match took place at Liverpool's home ground, not at Tottenham's. This contradicts the summary's claim that the match was at Tottenham.

3. The article quotes Mauricio Pochettino speaking about his team's performance and the implications for their title challenge. However, the summary incorrectly identifies Mauricio Pochettino as the Chelsea boss, when in fact he is the manager of Tottenham Hotspur.

4. The article does not provide a final score for the match, but it does indicate that Sadio Mane scored twice. The summary's claim of a 2-1 draw is not supported by the article, which suggests that Tottenham did not score or that the final score was different.

5. The article suggests that Tottenham's performance was poor and that they showed a lack of desire to play for a win, which is inconsistent with the summary's implication that Tottenham managed to draw the match.

6. The article also mentions that Chelsea could extend their lead at the top, which is unrelated to the summary's focus on a match involving Tottenham and an unspecified team for which Sadio Mane plays.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it misidentifies the team and manager, provides an incorrect match location, and inaccurately reports the match result.
