Article:
(CNN)Sky watchers in western North America are in for a treat: a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning. Here's how it's unfolding: . It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV . While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the "blood moon." NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a "tetrad."  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28. If you want to learn more about the eclipse, NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will take questions on Twitter @NASA_Marshall. Did you see the total lunar eclipse? Share your photos with CNN iReport.

Summary:
it started at 3:16 a.m. pacific daylight time, when the moon began moving into earth.

GPT4:
1. The article states that the total lunar eclipse began at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time (PDT), which is when the moon started moving into Earth's shadow.

2. The summary accurately reflects this starting time of the eclipse as mentioned in the article.

3. However, the summary is incomplete and does not provide the full context of the event. It only mentions the start time and the fact that the moon began moving into Earth's shadow, but it does not include any information about the duration of the eclipse, the total time the moon is engulfed in Earth's shadow, or any other details provided in the article.

4. The article also mentions that the total eclipse would last four minutes and 43 seconds and that it is the shortest one of the century, which is not included in the summary.

5. Additionally, the article provides information about the visibility of the eclipse in different regions, the reason for the reddish color of the moon during the eclipse (often referred to as a "blood moon"), and the fact that this eclipse is part of a tetrad (a series of four consecutive total lunar eclipses), none of which is mentioned in the summary.

6. The summary is not consistent with the article because it omits significant details that are necessary to understand the full scope and significance of the lunar eclipse event. It only captures the start time and a partial description of the beginning of the eclipse, leaving out the complete information provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the moon began moving into the earth.
2. The article states that the moon began moving into the earth's shadow.
3. The inconsistency is that the summary addresses the earth rather than the earth's shadow.
