Article:
Fosse Park, near junction 21 of the M1, opened in 1989 and was bought in August for Â£345.5m.
Plans are now being prepared to improve parking and traffic congestion and the appearance of units.
Ernie White, leader of Blaby District Council, said the new owners had met with the council to clear up "potential planning questions".
"Fosse Park is the gateway from Blaby into the city and they see it as an investment that they think they can improve," said Mr White.
"I think it could be a better view when you come into the city, at the moment all you see are far too many backs of sheds."
Paul Clarke, director of investments at Crown Estates, said: "Two things we want to address are parking and congestion issues around the park and we believe it has become rather tired over the last few years.
"We are very concerned to address the quality of what we call the common areas - where people have to walk and park - and the facilities available to make sure a location like Fosse Park is as good as it can be."

Summary:
more than 100 new parking units are needed to improve facilities at a west yorkshire park, the council has said.

GPT4:
1. Location Mismatch: The article mentions Fosse Park, which is located near junction 21 of the M1. There is no mention of West Yorkshire in the article. West Yorkshire is a different geographical location in the UK, which indicates that the summary is referring to a different place than the article.

2. Specific Number of Parking Units Not Mentioned: The article discusses plans to improve parking and traffic congestion at Fosse Park, but it does not specify the number of new parking units needed. The summary claims that "more than 100 new parking units are needed," which is a detail not provided in the article.

3. Source of the Claim: The article quotes Ernie White, the leader of Blaby District Council, and Paul Clarke, director of investments at Crown Estates, discussing the improvements and investments at Fosse Park. Neither of them is quoted as saying anything about the number of parking units required, nor does the article attribute this claim to the council in general.

4. Focus of the Article: The main focus of the article is on the recent purchase of Fosse Park and the plans to improve it, including addressing parking and congestion issues and enhancing the appearance of the units. The summary, however, introduces a specific claim about the number of parking units needed, which is not a focus or even a detail mentioned in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it refers to a different location (West Yorkshire instead of near junction 21 of the M1), includes a specific detail about the number of parking units that is not present in the article, and misattributes the source of this claim.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that "more than 100 new parking units are needed to improve facilities at a west yorkshire park." However, the article does not mention the word "parking units" or any specific number of parking spaces.
2. The article focuses on the new owners' plans to improve the park's appearance and address parking and congestion issues, but it does not mention anything about adding new parking units.
