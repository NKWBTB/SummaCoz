Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: ‘No, no, no, that’s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.’ The supplier, who has 35 years’ experience, says: ‘As you can see, they’ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they’ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can’t think there’s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.’ Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: ‘No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.’ Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’.

The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter. A great number suffer broken bones during this process.’ A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers ‘an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK’s most recognisable businesses’. It is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC.

Summary:
the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary arises from the phrase "the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed." This phrase suggests that the chickens are gassed while still in the sheds, which is not supported by the information in the article. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that the chickens are kept in huge sheds for 35 days, which is consistent with the summary.

2. However, the article then describes the process by which the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces, and sent to warehouses in large trays. This implies that the gassing and processing of the chickens occur after they have been removed from the sheds, not while they are still in them.

3. The article does not provide any information that the gassing happens within the sheds where the chickens live. Instead, it suggests a sequence of events where the chickens are first raised in the sheds and then later processed after they are large enough.

4. The summary's phrasing could mislead readers into thinking that the gassing occurs as part of the living conditions within the sheds, which is not the case according to the article.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the implication of where and when the gassing occurs, which is not accurately reflected in the summary based on the details provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
