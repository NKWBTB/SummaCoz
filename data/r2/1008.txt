Article:
Lilliard Gin is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.
It comes ahead of a number proposals, which are at various stages of the planning process, to open the region's first whisky distillery since 1837.
Lead distiller Kate Macinnes said the potential to make the Scottish Borders a "region of distilling excellence" was "really exciting".
"Our gin production is on a completely different scale to the other distilleries in development," she said.
"Our still is one of the smallest production stills in the UK, and our entire operation fits into a cowshed, but if people like our gin, that's all that matters.
"We have a rich abundance of wild food on our doorstep in the Teviot valley, and Lilliard Gin aims to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour palette and our Borders 'terroir'."
John Henderson, of Born in the Borders, said the gin distillery was a natural companion to the Scottish Borders Brewery on the site.
"To be able to play host to the first new distillery in the Borders in nearly 200 years is incredible," he said.
"And the fact that Lilliard Gin are looking to use Borders botanicals means they are completely in tune with our own ethos of local sourcing.
"We just can't wait for them to get started, and to taste their gin."
The gin takes its name from a legendary Borders figure.
"Lilliard was the heroine of the Battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545, fought just north of the distillery," explained Ms Macinnes.
"Lilliard reputedly fought to avenge the death of her lover at the hands of the English. The battle site is also known as Lilliard's Edge.
"We wanted a name that reflected our landscape, and our strong female production team, and Lilliard seemed like a natural choice."

a gin distillery has opened its doors to the public in the scottish borders.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses Lilliard Gin, which is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh. However, it does not explicitly state that the distillery has opened its doors to the public.

2. The article mentions that the gin comes ahead of several proposals to open the region's first whisky distillery since 1837, which implies that the gin distillery is already operational, but it does not confirm that it is open to the public for visits or tours.

3. The lead distiller, Kate Macinnes, talks about the production scale and the use of local botanicals, which suggests that gin production is underway. However, this does not equate to the distillery being open to the public.

5. The article concludes with background information on the name "Lilliard" and its historical significance, but it does not circle back to the current status of the distillery in terms of public engagement.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim that is not supported by the information provided.
