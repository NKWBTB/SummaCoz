Article:
(CNN)Blues legend B.B. King was hospitalized for dehydration, though the ailment didn't keep him out for long. King's dehydration was caused by his Type II diabetes, but he "is much better," his daughter, Claudette King, told the Los Angeles Times. The legendary guitarist and vocalist released a statement thanking those who have expressed their concerns. "I'm feeling much better and am leaving the hospital today," King said in a message Tuesday. Angela Moore, a publicist for Claudette King, said later in the day that he was back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren. "He was struggling before, and he is a trouper," Moore said. "He wasn't going to let his fans down." No more information on King's condition or where he was hospitalized was immediately available. B.B. is short for Blues Boy, part of the name he used as a Memphis disc jockey, the Beale Street Blues Boy. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and has 30 Grammy nominations. King, 89, has used various models of Gibson guitars over the years, and named each one of them Lucille. In the 1980s, Gibson officially dropped the model number on the guitar he used last and most. It became a custom-made signature model named Lucille, manufactured exclusively for the "King of the Blues." Some of his hits include "The Thrill Is Gone," which won him his first Grammy in 1970, "There Must be a Better World Somewhere" and "When Love Comes to Town," a collaboration with U2. Last year, the bluesman suffered from dehydration and exhaustion after a show in Chicago, forcing him to cancel the remainder of his tour. CNN's Greg Botelho and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Angela Moore was back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons.

2. First, the article mentions Angela Moore as a publicist for Claudette King, not as the person who was hospitalized or resting at home. Therefore, the subject of the summary should not be Angela Moore.

3. Second, the article clearly states that it was B.B. King who was hospitalized for dehydration and that he was the one who was "back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren" after being released from the hospital.

4. Third, the use of "his grandchildren" in the summary is incorrect when referring to Angela Moore, as it implies that Angela Moore is a male figure with grandchildren, which contradicts the information provided in the article.

5. The correct summary should reflect the information about B.B. King's hospitalization, release, and subsequent rest at home, not Angela Moore's activities.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies Angela Moore as the person who was hospitalized and resting at home, when in fact, it was B.B. King. The summary should be corrected to accurately represent the information about B.B. King's health and activities as reported in the article.
