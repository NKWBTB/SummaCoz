Article:
A petty feud between the two most powerful women in Ed Miliband’s inner circle has rocked the Labour Party. The dispute between the party’s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell – who is tipped as a future Labour leader – to attend the Brits ‘pre-party’ where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.’ The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the ‘second jobs’ debate was partly the responsibility of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London’s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co’ at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics – as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party’s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: ‘Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. ‘We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.’ A Labour spokesman said last night: ‘There is no truth in this allegation.’

GPT4:
The summary provided is not consistent with the article for several reasons:

1. The summary is incomplete and does not make sense grammatically. It states, "insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear," which is a fragment and does not convey a complete thought. It seems to be missing key information that would make it a coherent sentence.

2. The article discusses a feud between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, two powerful women in Ed Miliband's inner circle. The summary does not mention either of these individuals or the nature of their dispute.

3. The article provides details about the cause of the feud, which was a disagreement over Lucy Powell's plans to attend the Brit Awards pre-party on the night of a crucial Commons vote. The summary does not reference this event or the disagreement about attending it.

4. The article mentions that the argument was related to a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs from having second jobs and that Powell had a special duty to be present because of her role in the Shadow Cabinet Office team. None of this context is included in the summary.

5. The article includes quotes and opinions from sources about the dispute and its impact on the Labour Party, as well as a denial from a Labour spokesman. The summary does not reflect any of this information.

In conclusion, the summary fails to accurately represent the content of the article, omitting key details about the individuals involved, the nature of the dispute, and the context within which it occurred. It also presents a grammatically incorrect and incomplete sentence that does not capture the essence of the article.
