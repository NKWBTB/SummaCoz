GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the location mentioned. The article states that Trevor Deely was last seen in Dublin, specifically mentioning locations such as Chapelizod, the River Liffey, and Baggot Street. County Antrim, however, is not mentioned anywhere in the article. County Antrim is located in Northern Ireland, which is a separate jurisdiction from the Republic of Ireland, where Dublin is situated. The summary incorrectly states that the disappearance occurred in County Antrim, while the article clearly indicates that the events took place in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Therefore, the location in the summary does not match the information provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the article is about police investigating the disappearance of a man in County Antrim and releasing CCTV footage of a man they want to trace.
2. However, the article is about the search for Trevor Deely, a specific individual who went missing in Dublin, not County Antrim. The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, the area being searched in Dublin, the involvement of the Irish police (Gardaí), and the release of CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly places the events in County Antrim, while the article is specific to the case of Trevor Deely in Dublin.
