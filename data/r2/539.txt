GPT4:
1. The article does not mention a player named Glenn Groves; it mentions a person named Dan Groves. Therefore, the name "Glenn Groves" in the summary is inconsistent with the information provided in the article.

2. The article does not discuss any transfer or signing of a player to or from Crawley Town. The summary's claim that Crawley Town has signed a player is not supported by the article.

3. The article does not mention a non-league side called "Leway Town." The summary introduces a team that is not referenced in the article, which creates inconsistency.

4. The article talks about a potential deal involving a person named Wright buying a stake in Billericay Town FC and possibly becoming a club director. The summary does not mention this potential deal or Wright's involvement with Billericay Town FC, which is a key point of the article.

5. The summary incorrectly identifies the subject as a right-back, which is a specific playing position in football. The article does not specify any playing positions or indicate that the person in question is a player being transferred.

In conclusion, the summary introduces names, details, and events (such as a transfer to Crawley Town and a non-league side called Leway Town) that are not present in the article, making it inconsistent with the original text.

HUMAN:

2. However, the article states that Wright played non-league football for a succession of clubs, including Lewes, Crawley Town and Rushden & Diamonds.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies a player transfer between Crawley Town and Leway Town, while the article only mentions that Wright played non-league football for Crawley Town and Leway Town.
