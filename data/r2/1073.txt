GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary arises from the mention of "torrential rain" as a cause for the cancellations and disruptions. The article does not mention rain at all; instead, it attributes the damage and disruptions to strong winds. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the inconsistency:

1. The article begins by describing the damage caused by strong winds, such as part of a school roof being ripped off and power cuts across Wales.

2. It mentions a yellow 'be aware' warning for wind, not rain, which was in effect until midnight on Friday.

3. The disruptions listed in the article, including train delays, speed and lane restrictions on bridges, and power cuts, are all attributed to the wind.

4. The highest gusts of wind were recorded, further emphasizing the wind as the disruptive element.

5. Irish Ferries cancelled sailings due to "adverse weather conditions" on the Irish Sea, but the article specifies that it was the wind that led to these cancellations, not rain.

6. Arriva Trains Wales warned of issues due to the winds, not rain.

7. The National Trust closures of Erddig Hall and Chirk Castle are also attributed to expected high winds.

8. The article concludes by mentioning that winds eased on Friday evening and that a blustery forecast for the weekend led to the postponement of a festive event.

At no point does the article discuss torrential rain or attribute any of the weather-related issues to rain. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly cites "torrential rain and winds" as the cause of the cancellations and disruptions, when in fact, the article only mentions wind as the cause.

HUMAN:
1.The summary states that winds were caused by torrential rain
2. However, the article does not mention anything about torrential rain.
3. The article also mentions that the winds eased into Friday evening, indicating that there were no ongoing cancellations or disruptions due to winds which was not mentioned in the summary.
4. The article does not mention any cancellations due to winds. Instead, it mentions power cuts, train delays, and speed restrictions due to high winds.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of cancellations due to winds in the article.
