GPT4:
1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo has urged Andrea Pirlo and "Francisco Totti" to join him at Boca Juniors. However, the inconsistency lies in the name "Francisco Totti." The article refers to the Italian footballer as "Francesco Totti," which is the correct name. "Francisco" is a Spanish variant of the name, while "Francesco" is the Italian version.

2. The summary correctly mentions that Osvaldo moved to Boca Juniors on a loan deal from Southampton and has scored three goals in six games, which is consistent with the information provided in the article.

3. The summary states, "Osvaldo believes that the duo would love to have them line up on the la Bombonera pitch." This sentence is not only awkwardly phrased but also misrepresents Osvaldo's sentiment. The article indicates that Osvaldo believes the fans would love to have Pirlo and Totti at Boca Juniors, not that the duo themselves would love it. The correct sentiment is that Osvaldo thinks the fans would be excited to see Pirlo and Totti play at La Bombonera, Boca Junior's home stadium.

In conclusion, the inconsistency in the summary is the incorrect name "Francisco Totti" instead of "Francesco Totti," and the misrepresentation of Osvaldo's belief about who would love to see the duo play at La Bombonera.
