Article:
Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save. Fortunately for the young England player, it didn't prove costly as Mirallas went on to score the only goal of the game after 29 minutes.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Ross Barkley missed a penalty in the Premier League," which is consistent with the article. The article mentions that Barkley missed a penalty in the 10th minute of the game against Burnley.

2. The summary then mentions that "his replacement Leighton Baines had no problem taking the shot." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons:

   - The article does not mention that Leighton Baines replaced Ross Barkley for the penalty kick. Instead, it suggests that Baines was on the pitch at the time and was the usual penalty taker with a record of 15 penalties scored from 16 attempts.
   
   - The article indicates that there was no dispute between Barkley and Baines over the penalty, implying that Baines did not attempt to take the penalty instead of Barkley.
   
   - The article also quotes manager Roberto Martinez saying that Baines was happy to give Barkley the responsibility to take the penalty, which contradicts the idea of Baines being a replacement for Barkley for the penalty kick.

3. The summary implies that Baines took a penalty shot after Barkley missed, which is not supported by the article. The article only discusses the single penalty taken by Barkley and does not mention Baines taking a penalty shot at all during the match.

In conclusion, the inconsistency lies in the claim that Leighton Baines replaced Ross Barkley for the penalty kick and had no problem taking the shot, which is not supported by the information provided in the article. The article makes it clear that Barkley took the penalty with Baines' support and that Baines did not take a penalty shot during the game.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Ross Barkley missed a penalty, but his replacement Leighton Baines had no problem taking the shot.
2. However, the article states that Barkley took the penalty, not Baines.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Barkley missed the penalty and was replaced by Baines, when in fact Barkley took the penalty and it was saved by the goalkeeper.
