Article:
Mr Hockey's appointment comes after he left politics following his removal as treasurer by Malcolm Turnbull.
He had been seen as a close ally of Tony Abbott who was ousted as PM by Mr Turnbull in a party vote in September.
Mr Turnbull said Mr Hockey was "a great Australian, he is one of the most engaging, persuasive people I've known in public life".
"He's held very high office, he's got great contacts in the United States, he's a passionate patriot," he told Australian media.
Announcing the appointment, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia's relationship with the United States was the "bedrock of foreign and defence policy".
Some in the Labor opposition questioned the move, citing Mr Turnbull's role in ousting Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey's departure from politics.
"This is a very important posting for Australia and should be done by someone with a deep interest for foreign affairs," said deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek.
"There is no doubt this is a captain's pick by Malcolm Turnbull," she told ABC television.
Kim Beazley, who has has been Australia's ambassador to the United States since 2010, will be replaced by Mr Hockey in January.

GPT4:
The summary states that "Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been named as Australia's new Prime Minister." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons:

1. The article does not mention Malcolm Turnbull being named as Australia's new Prime Minister. Instead, it discusses his role in the political landscape, including his involvement in the ousting of Tony Abbott as PM and his subsequent appointment of Mr. Hockey as the ambassador to the United States.

2. The article actually refers to Malcolm Turnbull as the current Prime Minister at the time of the events described, indicating that he was already serving in that role. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to state that he has been named as the new Prime Minister within the context of this article.

3. The focus of the article is on the appointment of Mr. Hockey as Australia's ambassador to the United States, not on any change in the Prime Minister's position. Malcolm Turnbull's comments in the article are in his capacity as the Prime Minister discussing Mr. Hockey's new role.

4. The article mentions that Mr. Hockey was removed as treasurer by Malcolm Turnbull, which implies that Turnbull was already in a position of authority, consistent with him being the Prime Minister at the time.

In summary, the article is about Mr. Hockey's appointment as ambassador to the United States and Malcolm Turnbull's role as the existing Prime Minister, not about Turnbull being named as the new Prime Minister. The summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly suggests a new appointment for Malcolm Turnbull that the article does not support.
