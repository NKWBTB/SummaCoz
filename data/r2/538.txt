Summary:
billericay town have sacked manager jose wright, who has died at the age of 88. start to the season.

GPT4:
The summary contains several points that are inconsistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "Billericay Town have sacked manager Jose Wright," but the article does not mention anyone by the name of Jose Wright, nor does it discuss the sacking of a manager. The article instead talks about a potential deal involving a person named Wright, likely referring to Mark Wright, who is considering buying a stake in the club.

2. The summary claims that this individual "has died at the age of 88," which is inconsistent with the article. The article mentions that Mark Wright is 30 years old and is considering becoming a club director. There is no mention of anyone's death, let alone the death of someone named Jose Wright or Mark Wright.

3. The phrase "start to the season" in the summary is not connected to any coherent information and seems to be an incomplete thought. The article does not discuss the start of the season or any related context that would make this phrase relevant.

4. The article discusses the potential involvement of Mark Wright with Billericay Town, the club's current standing in the Isthmian League Premier Division, the recent takeover by Glenn Tamplin, and the signing of Paul Konchesky. None of these points are reflected in the summary, which instead provides incorrect and unrelated information.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces incorrect information about a managerial sacking and a death that are not mentioned in the article, and it fails to accurately represent the content that is actually discussed in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Billericay Town sacked manager Jose Wright, who has passed away at the age of 88, at the start of the season.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Billericay Town sacking manager Jose Wright or his passing at the age of 88. Instead, it discusses Akil Wright's potential involvement with Billericay Football Club and the club's current status.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary introduces a narrative about the sacking and death of a manager named Jose Wright, while the article does not mention it at all and primarily focuses on Akil Wright's potential deal with Billericay Football Club.
