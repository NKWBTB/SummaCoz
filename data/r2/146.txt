GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the use of the term 'tragic death' which does not appear in the article. The article only refers to the death as 'unexplained'. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The summary states "police have launched probe into 'unexplained death' of sophia walker." This is consistent with the article, which mentions "Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of Sophia Walker."

2. The summary then repeats itself with a slight variation, stating "police have launched a probe into the 'tragic death' of sophia walker." This is inconsistent because the article does not describe the death as 'tragic'; it consistently refers to it as 'unexplained'. The term 'tragic' is an interpretation that is not supported by the language used in the article.

3. The summary correctly states that the mother said she was 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead, which is supported by the mother's quotes shared in the article.

4. The summary accurately quotes the mother, Patricia Hodgdon, and her expression of grief, which is consistent with the article.

5. Lastly, the summary mentions that Sophia was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father, which is also consistent with the details provided in the article.

In conclusion, the inconsistency arises from the use of 'tragic death' in the summary, which is not a term used in the article. The article only refers to the death as 'unexplained'.
