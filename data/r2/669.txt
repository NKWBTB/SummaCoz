Summary:
a prison has said it is " frightened " after reports reports reports people were thrown into a prison by drones in essex.

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The emotion "frightened" is attributed to the prison in the summary ("a prison has said it is 'frightened'"), which is not consistent with the article. Prisons, as institutions, do not experience emotions. The article does mention a woman living near the prison who said, "I don't feel frightened," which contradicts the claim that the prison itself is frightened.

2. The summary states that "reports reports reports people were thrown into a prison by drones in Essex." This statement is nonsensical due to the repetition of the word "reports" and the claim that people were thrown into the prison by drones. The article does not mention anything about people being thrown into the prison. Instead, it discusses packages being thrown over the prison walls and the use of drones to fly contraband goods to prison windows, which is a very different scenario.

3. The location "Essex" is correctly mentioned in the summary, but the specific prison, Chelmsford Prison, is not named. While this is not a direct inconsistency, the summary could be misleading by not specifying which prison in Essex is being discussed.

4. The summary fails to include any mention of the types of contraband being thrown over the prison walls, such as mobile phones and synthetic cannabis, which are detailed in the article.

5. The article states that the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site, which contradicts the summary's claim about drones being used to throw people into the prison.

Overall, the summary misrepresents the content of the article by incorrectly attributing emotions to the prison, making an erroneous claim about people being thrown into the prison by drones, and omitting key details about the nature of the contraband and the actual events described in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a prison in Essex is "frightened" after reports of people being thrown into the prison by drones.
2. However, the article does not support this implication. While the article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the prison wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, it does not mention the prison itself being "frightened" or people being thrown into the prison by drones.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a statement not found in the article and misrepresents the prison's reaction to the reported incidents.
