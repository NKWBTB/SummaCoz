GPT4:
1. The article discusses the campaign expenditures of various political parties in the UK during the European elections, including UKIP, the Conservatives, the Lib Dems, Labour, and the Green Party.

2. The article states that UKIP won the election, not the Conservatives. Therefore, the Conservatives did not retain control as the summary suggests.

3. The article does not mention any party having control over the Green Party. The summary's claim that the Conservatives have retained control of the Green Party is not supported by any information in the article.

4. The article provides specific financial figures for each party's campaign spending and the cost per vote, but it does not discuss the control of one party over another.

5. The article mentions the 2009 European election campaign only in the context of comparing spending, not in terms of control or outcomes.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the Conservatives won the election and retained control of the Green Party, neither of which is supported by the article. The article is solely focused on campaign expenditures and the number of votes received by each party.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the Conservatives have retained control of the Green Party following the 2009 European elections.
2. However, the article does not contain any information about the Conservatives retaining control of the Green Party. It provides campaign expenditure figures for various political parties during the European elections but does not mention the control of the Green Party.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies a political control scenario that is not supported by the information in the article.
