GPT4:
The summary states that "the collection of the oldest collection in the UK, the Wedgwood Museum, has been saved after a campaign to save it." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons:

1. The article does not claim that the Wedgwood Museum has the oldest collection in the UK. It mentions that the collection includes 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters, and photographs, but there is no mention of the collection being the oldest in the UK.

2. The summary simplifies the situation by stating that there was a campaign to save the collection, which is true, but it omits key details that are present in the article. The article explains that the campaign was specifically launched to prevent the collection from being auctioned to pay off the pottery firm's pension debt. It also mentions that the campaign was successful and hit its target in just a month.

3. The article provides additional information about the future of the collection that is not included in the summary. It states that the Art Fund will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and it will then be loaned to the Wedgwood Museum. This detail is important as it outlines the arrangement made for the collection after the campaign.

4. The article includes quotes and comments from various individuals involved in the campaign and the administration of the museum, which adds depth to the story of the collection being saved. The summary does not reflect any of these perspectives.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately describes the Wedgwood Museum's collection as the oldest in the UK and fails to include important details about the campaign, the future plans for the collection, and the perspectives of those involved.
