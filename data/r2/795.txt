Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future.

Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that Emmanuel Adebayor "posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris." This is consistent with the article, which mentions that Adebayor posted a video on his Instagram account of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark.

2. The summary also mentions that "the Togo international has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane." This information is consistent with the article, which confirms that Adebayor has one year left on his contract with Tottenham.

3. The inconsistency arises with the statement that Adebayor is "the 27-year-old." The article does not provide Adebayor's age, and given that Adebayor was born on February 26, 1984, he would have been around 39 years old at the time of the article's knowledge cutoff in 2023. Therefore, the age provided in the summary is incorrect and not supported by the article.
