GPT4:
1. The article states that Kyle MacLachlan is the only cast member currently confirmed for the "Twin Peaks" reboot. This suggests that he is the only one who has been officially announced or attached to the project at the time of the article's publication.

2. However, the summary states that "MacLachlan is the only cast member for the reboot," which implies that he is the only one who will be in the reboot, excluding the possibility of other cast members joining.

3. The article also mentions other original cast members like Sherilyn Fenn, Sheryl Lee, James Marshall, and Peggy Lipton, who are actively supporting David Lynch in his salary standoff with Showtime. They appear in a video for the #SaveTwinPeaks campaign, which indicates their interest and potential involvement in the project.

4. The article does not explicitly state that these other cast members will not be part of the reboot; it only confirms that MacLachlan is currently the only one confirmed.

5. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it suggests that MacLachlan will be the sole cast member, which is not a claim made by the article. The article leaves open the possibility that other original cast members could be confirmed at a later date.
