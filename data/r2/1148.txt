Article:
Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15.
His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed "aggressively" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
"It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office," Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.
The teenager was described by his coach as "a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend".
Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.
If convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail.
Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: "We remain cautious. A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it's been [more than] 40 years since a cop was convicted in [Texas]."

GPT4:
The summary states that "a man has been charged with the murder of a Dallas teenager who was shot dead in the US state of Texas." This statement is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The summary refers to the individual charged as "a man" without specifying his profession or role. The article clearly identifies Roy Oliver as a police officer, which is a significant detail in the context of the incident.

2. The summary does not mention the name of the victim, Jordan Edwards, who was 15 years old. Including the victim's name and age provides important context to the incident.

3. The summary does not provide any details about the circumstances of the shooting. The article explains that the incident occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party, and that Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party. It also mentions that the police initially claimed the vehicle was reversing "aggressively" towards the officer, but this was discredited by footage showing the car driving forward, away from him.

4. The summary does not mention that Roy Oliver was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, which is relevant information as it relates to the other teenagers in the car.

5. The summary does not reflect the potential historical significance of the case mentioned in the article, which states that if convicted, Roy Oliver would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas County since 1973.

6. The summary does not mention that Roy Oliver has been fired from the police force for policy violations, which is an important detail in understanding the aftermath of the incident.

7. The summary does not include any information about the ongoing legal process, such as the fact that no trial date has been set, that Roy Oliver is currently free on bail, or the potential prison sentence he faces if convicted.

In conclusion, the summary lacks several critical details that are necessary to accurately represent the content of the article, such as the profession of the charged individual, the name and age of the victim, the circumstances of the shooting, additional charges, the historical context of the case, and details about the legal proceedings.
