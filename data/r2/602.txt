Summary:

GPT4:
1. The article does not mention that Clive Weatherhogg was jailed for eight years. The summary states this as a fact, but the article only discusses the conviction and the fact that the case was remitted to the High Court for sentencing due to its greater sentencing powers. The actual sentence is not provided in the article.

2. The article does not state that Weatherhogg was convicted of attempting to blackmail a woman. Instead, it says he was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with another man, not her boyfriend, which he found through an adult website.

3. The article does not mention anything about the woman's boyfriend or any sexual activity involving him. The summary incorrectly introduces the idea of the woman's boyfriend being involved, which is not supported by the information in the article.

4. The article does not state that Weatherhogg was convicted of sexual activity with the woman. It states that he coerced the woman to engage in sexual activity with another man, which is different from being convicted of engaging in sexual activity himself.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it provides incorrect information about the length of the sentence, the nature of the crime (blackmail versus coercion), and the involvement of the woman's boyfriend, none of which are supported by the details in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that a man has been jailed for eight years after being convicted of attempting to blackmail a woman and sexual activity with her boyfriend.
2. However, the article does not mention that the man was convicted of "attempting to blackmail a woman and sexual activity with her boyfriend." Instead, the article provides information about Clive Weatherhogg, who was found guilty of coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man. The charges against Weatherhogg involve arranging sexual encounters for the woman through an adult website and sending explicit material to the victim's sister, but it doesn't mention "blackmailing a woman" or "sexual activity with her boyfriend."
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies a different set of charges and circumstances that were not supported by the article.
