They are a stunning visualisation of the art - and how it is orange. A programmer has created these stunning graphs to reveal the dominant colour of artworks through history They show Orange has always been the most popular colour - although in recent years blue has begun to catch up. The software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online. The plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800-2000. The graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th Century, with all colours increasing except for orange. 'I made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time,' said Martin Bellander, a PhD student in psychology at the Karolinska Institute who created the graph. To do this, he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. Then, the software extract the relevant colour information from them, and plots it in a nice way. He found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue. 'The changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor,' he wrote. 'One of these could of course be trends in the use of colour. 'If we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings, it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use. 'For example the marked increase of blue at the time of the First World War, might actually reflect a true trend in colour use.' Two versions of Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting on show at the National Gallery in in London, England: Yellow and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800, it has been found. Bellander used freely available images for the project. 'There are a bunch of different sites where you can access (photos of) paintings,  for instance the BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. .'One of my favorites is the BBC's site where you can browse through over 200K of well organized paintings - an amazing resource. 'For many of these there is also information on the year they were painted, the artist, etc.' He believes that some experts who have claimed perhaps the change is due top the price of paint are wrong. 'I haven’t found any data on the prices of blue, so that explanation is hard to elaborate on. 'However, it is not only blue that increases but all colors except orange, which might speak against the pigment prices explanation. ' The same graph, but with only oil paintings 'UnTrou sur l'Orange' by Jesus Rafael Soto: Researcher have found orange is by far the most common colour in art.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement about the color trends in the artworks. The summary claims that "the graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th century, with all colours." This statement is misleading because it suggests that all colors have been increasing in usage, which contradicts the information in the article. The article specifically states that "all colours [are] increasing except for orange," indicating that orange is the exception to the trend.

Additionally, the summary omits the key finding that orange has been the most popular color historically, which is a significant detail from the article. The article states, "They show Orange has always been the most popular colour," and later it mentions, "Yellow and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800." This information is not reflected in the summary, leading to an inconsistency.

Lastly, the summary ends with a fragment that seems out of context: "they are available for free download - bbc." This sentence is incomplete and does not provide clear information. It appears to be an attempt to mention that the images used for the project were freely available for download from various sources, including the BBC, but it does not accurately or coherently convey that information.

In summary, the inconsistencies are:
1. The misleading statement about the trend of all colors increasing, which is not true for orange.
2. The omission of the historical dominance of orange as the most popular color in artworks.
3. The incoherent and incomplete mention of the availability of images for free download.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the software extracts relevant color information from images or artworks found online.
2. However, the article does mention the software used to extract relevant color information from images or artworks found online, which is consistent with the summary. However, the summary also includes the phrase "they are available for free download - bbc," which is not present in the article and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary adds information about the availability of images for free download from the BBC, which is not supported by the article.
