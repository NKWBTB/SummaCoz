Article:
Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016.
This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m.
Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield.
The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors.
It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear.
In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict.
"We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one.
"The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about."

Summary:
the scottish dairy industry has reported a pre-tax profit of £1. 5m for 2015.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses the financial results of the Harbro Group, an Aberdeenshire-based company, not the Scottish dairy industry as a whole. The summary incorrectly attributes the financial results to the entire Scottish dairy industry.

2. The pre-tax profit figure mentioned in the article for Harbro Group is £3.5m, not £1.5m as stated in the summary. This is a significant discrepancy in the financial data.

3. The time frame provided in the article is for the year ending in June 2016, whereas the summary mentions the year 2015. This is an inconsistency in the reporting period.

4. The article does not provide any specific information about the overall performance of the Scottish dairy industry, so the summary's focus on the dairy industry is not supported by the article.

5. The article mentions that Harbro Group's turnover fell by £1m to just over £100m, which is not reflected in the summary. The summary does not mention turnover at all.

6. The article specifies that Harbro Group's international sales grew and that it manufactures and supplies feeds for various agricultural sectors, including dairy. However, the summary's narrow focus on the dairy industry does not capture the breadth of Harbro Group's operations as described in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately represents the financial figures, the time frame, the entity in question (Harbro Group vs. the Scottish dairy industry), and omits key details about the company's operations and performance.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the Scottish dairy industry has reported a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for 2015.

3. The article does not mention anything about a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for 2015. It only states that Harbro Group saw a pre-tax profit increase of £800,000 to £3.5m in the year to the end of June 2016.
