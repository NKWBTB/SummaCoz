GPT4:
1. The summary states that "manuel pellegrini is currently under pressure to save manchester city's season." This is consistent with the article, which mentions that Pellegrini is under heavy pressure with City faltering in their Barclays Premier League title defence and facing an uphill task against Barcelona in the Champions League.

2. The summary also states that "mancini thinks pellegrini was 'really lucky' to inherit a strong side." This is consistent with the article, where Mancini is quoted saying, "I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team."

3. The summary mentions that "manchester city will look to overturn a 201 deficit against barcelona." This is inconsistent with the article, which states that Manchester City will look to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Barcelona, not a 201 deficit.

4. The summary includes the point that "pellegrini has come under fire for city faltering title defence." This is consistent with the article, which discusses the pressure Pellegrini is facing due to City's faltering title defence and their Champions League campaign.

5. Finally, the summary claims that "roberto mancini has turned up the heat for manuel pellegrini's successor." This is inconsistent with the article, as it suggests that Mancini is putting pressure on the person who succeeded Pellegrini, but the article is actually about Mancini putting pressure on Pellegrini himself, who is the current manager and not the successor. Mancini is the predecessor, not Pellegrini's successor.

In conclusion, the inconsistencies in the summary are the incorrect deficit mentioned in point 3 and the incorrect reference to Pellegrini's successor in point 5.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Manuel Pellegrini is currently under pressure to save Manchester City's season, and Roberto Mancini thinks Pellegrini was "really lucky" to inherit a strong side. It also mentions that Manchester City will look to overturn a 201 deficit against Barcelona, and Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defense. Finally, it states that Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat for Manuel Pellegrini's successor.
2. However, the article states that Manuel Pellegrini did win two trophies last season, contradicting the implication that he has been entirely unsuccessful. Additionally, while Mancini criticizes Pellegrini, the article does not explicitly mention that Pellegrini is currently under pressure or facing criticism for the ongoing season. The summary suggests a sense of urgency and criticism that may not be entirely supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies current pressure on Pellegrini and criticism for the ongoing season, while the article focuses more on Mancini's comments about Pellegrini being lucky, without explicitly stating that Pellegrini is currently under intense pressure or criticism.
