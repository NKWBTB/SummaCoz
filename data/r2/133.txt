GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the phrase "the tower itself did not have been halted around midnight." This phrase is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the article. The correct information from the article is that "the fire's spread had been halted around midnight," which refers to the containment of the fire, not the tower itself being halted. The tower cannot be halted as it is a structure, not an action or process that can be stopped. The summary should have stated that the spread of the fire was halted around midnight, not the tower itself.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday, and the tower itself did not have significant damage, and the fire was halted around midnight.
2. However, the article states that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday in the bell tower, specifically in the wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower as it undergoes restoration. The article mentions that the emergencies ministry for Moscow reported the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, and the fire's spread had been halted around midnight. The summary incorrectly mentions that the blaze broke out at the convent and in wooden scaffolding without specifying the bell tower. This creates a factual inconsistency.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary does not specify that the blaze occurred in the bell tower of the Novodevichy Convent and incorrectly attributes the lack of significant damage to the entire convent, not just the tower.
