Article:
Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. Tielemans, 17, has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal also and is a centre midfielder of some promise. He became the youngest Belgian player to play in the UEFA Champions League, making his Champions League debut at the age of 16 years, four months and 25 days in 2013. Chelsea are keen on signing Anderlecht teenagerÂ Youri Tielemans (pictured on the left) Leander Dendoncker is also said to be on Chelsea's radar after impressing for Anderlecht in recent weeks . Dendoncker, 19, is a more defensive player and can operate in midfield or at centre back. He scored Anderlecht's second goal in a feisty 2-0 win over Kortrijk on Sunday which saw both sides reduced to 10 men while Tielemans was one of four players booked. Belgium newspaper HLN reported that Chelsea scout Tony White was in the crowd to watch the game. Meanwhile, Chelsea have extended contracts for 18-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda Jnr to 2019 and his elder brother Tika Musonda until 2016.

Summary:
chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on anderlecht.

GPT4:
The summary states that "Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht," which is a very broad and vague statement. It does not accurately reflect the specific content of the article, which provides detailed information about Chelsea's interest in two Anderlecht players, Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. Here are the steps to identify the inconsistency:

1. The article specifically mentions that Chelsea is interested in Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. The summary does not mention these players at all.

2. The article provides details about the players' positions, ages, and recent performances, indicating that Chelsea's interest is in these individual players rather than the club Anderlecht as a whole.

3. The article also mentions that Chelsea scout Tony White was present at a game to watch the players, which further supports the idea that Chelsea's interest is focused on Tielemans and Dendoncker specifically.

4. Additionally, the article mentions contract extensions for other Belgian players at Chelsea, which is not reflected in the summary.

5. The summary's use of the term "watching brief" is too general and does not capture the targeted nature of Chelsea's scouting efforts as described in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it fails to accurately represent the specific details of Chelsea's interest in the Anderlecht players Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker.
