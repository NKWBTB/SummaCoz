GPT4:
1. The summary begins by stating "one of the men pleaded not guilty friday based on charges that she married 10 men over 11 years and charged a fee for her `services'". This is inconsistent with the article, which clearly states that it was Liana Barrientos, a woman, who pleaded not guilty to the charges of marrying 10 men over 11 years, not one of the men she married.

2. The summary then refers to "Barrientos Barrientos" which seems to be a typographical error or a repetition mistake. The article only mentions Liana Barrientos without any repetition of the last name.

3. The summary mentions that "Barrientos wed was deported back to Pakistan for making threatening statements against the United States in 2006 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force." This is misleading because it suggests that Barrientos herself was deported. In fact, the article states that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, who was deported to Pakistan, not Barrientos.

4. The summary correctly states that Barrientos is originally from the Dominican Republic and lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February. However, it incorrectly states that she was legally married to at least four people at the time of her arrest. The article does not specify the exact number of legal marriages at the time of her arrest, only that she had been married ten times in total and had divorced at least four times.

5. The summary omits important details from the article, such as the fact that Barrientos pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument involving marriage licenses, and that she had been arrested multiple times for various offenses. It also leaves out the information about the countries her husbands were from, which were considered 'red flags' for immigration, and the details of her marriages and divorces.

In conclusion, the summary contains inaccuracies and misleading statements that are not consistent with the information provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a woman pleaded not guilty to charges related to marrying 10 men over 11 years and charged a fee for her "services."
2. However, the article states that the woman in question is Lianna Barrientos, who pleaded not guilty to charges related to her alleged marriage-for-hire immigration scheme, which involved marrying 10 men over 11 years. It also mentions that one of the men she married was deported to Pakistan for making threatening statements against the United States.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary combines unrelated information into a single sentence and lacks details compared to the article, which provides a more comprehensive account of the situation, including the woman's name, specific charges, and details about her marriages.
