GPT4:
1. The article does not mention a player named "Jeremy Clarkson." It refers to a player with the last name Clarkson, but his first name is not provided in the provided text. Therefore, the summary incorrectly names the player as "Jeremy Clarkson."

2. The article does not state that Clarkson has been signed on loan. It simply mentions that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and is set to make his debut for St Mirren. There is no mention of the terms of his move to St Mirren, whether it is a loan or a permanent transfer.

3. The article does not specify the duration of Clarkson's contract or agreement with St Mirren. The summary claims it is until the end of the season, but this information is not corroborated by the article.

4. The article does mention that Clarkson could make his debut for St Mirren in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday, but it does not provide any details about the nature of his contract or the length of his stay with the club.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately names the player as "Jeremy Clarkson," incorrectly states that he was signed on loan, and provides a specific duration for his stay with St Mirren, none of which is supported by the information in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that St Mirren have signed forward Jeremy Clarkson on loan from Dundee until the end of the season.
2. However, the article states that the player in question is unnamed in the article, and there is no mention of Jeremy Clarkson. The article talks about a forward who joined Premiership Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship. The player's name is not provided.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which mentions Jeremy Clarkson, a well-known television presenter, in connection with a football transfer, which is not supported by the article's content.
