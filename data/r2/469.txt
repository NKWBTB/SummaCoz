Summary:
a fire that destroyed a disused waste site in eamonn, county down, is to be investigated by the environment agency.

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. Location of the fire: The summary states that the fire destroyed a disused waste site in Eamonn, County Down. However, the article mentions that the fire occurred on Duncan Street, with no reference to Eamonn, County Down. This suggests that the location provided in the summary is incorrect.

2. Status of the waste site: The summary describes the site as "disused," implying it was no longer in operation. However, the article does not state that the site was disused. In fact, it mentions that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire, which implies that the site was in use at the time of the incident.

3. Investigation by the Environment Agency: The summary claims that the fire is to be investigated by the Environment Agency. The article does not mention any new investigation to be initiated by the EA. Instead, it discusses actions already taken by the EA, such as revoking the environmental permit of the company and the previous concerns raised by the fire service to the EA.

4. The cause of the fire: The summary does not mention anything about the cause of the fire. The article, however, explicitly states that "The cause of the fire remains undetermined." This is an important detail that is omitted in the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides an incorrect location, incorrectly describes the operational status of the waste site, inaccurately claims a new investigation by the Environment Agency, and omits the current status of the fire's cause.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a fire that destroyed a disused waste site in Eamonn, County Down, is to be investigated by the Environment Agency.
2. However, the article discusses a fire in Duncan Street, Greater Manchester, and actions taken by the Environment Agency (EA) and the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS). There is no mention of Eamonn, County Down, in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary makes by referencing a different location (Eamonn, County Down) that is not mentioned in the article.
