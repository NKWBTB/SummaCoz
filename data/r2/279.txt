Real Madrid will need to play with intensity for 90 minutes and not just the first half if they are to have a chance of beating Barcelona in Sunday's La Liga 'Clasico', according to Real coach Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.

GPT4:
1. The summary starts with the correct statement that "Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games for Real Madrid." This is consistent with the article, which mentions "A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches."

2. The next part of the summary states "Ancelotti's Ancelotti says he was concerned by the way his players relaxed." This is a slight misrepresentation of the article. The article quotes Ancelotti expressing concern about the second half of the game, saying, "the second worries me a bit." The summary's phrasing is redundant with "Ancelotti's Ancelotti" and should simply be "Ancelotti says."

3. The summary correctly states that "Real Madrid will need to play with intensity for 90 minutes." This is consistent with Ancelotti's comments in the article, where he emphasizes the need for full-match intensity: "on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match."

4. The summary then says, "Bale has received a lot of criticism from his La Liga double." This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article mentions that Bale "silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu," implying that the criticism was prior to his performance in this match, not as a result of it. The summary incorrectly suggests that the criticism came from the double itself.

5. Lastly, the summary states, "both goals were scored in the first half." This is consistent with the article, which indicates that Bale's two goals were scored before halftime.

In conclusion, the inconsistency in the summary lies in the misrepresentation of the source of criticism towards Bale. The article suggests that Bale faced criticism before his performance against Levante, while the summary incorrectly implies that the criticism came from his performance in that match. Additionally, there is a minor error with the redundancy in Ancelotti's name.
