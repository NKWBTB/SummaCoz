Article:
Draft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate threatens to reduce Iranian women to 'baby-making machines' and set their rights back by decades, Amnesty International warned on Wednesday. The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.

GPT4:
The summary contains several points that need to be checked against the article for consistency:

1. "draft legislation threatens to reduce iranian women to 'baby-making machines'" - This is consistent with the article, as Amnesty International has warned that the draft legislation would set women's rights back by decades and view them as "baby-making machines."

2. "london-based human rights group says a first bill would restrict access to contraception" - This is consistent with the article, which states that the first bill would restrict access to contraception and force women into unsafe backstreet abortions.

3. "iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065" - This is not consistent with the article. The article states that Iran is seeking to double its population within 50 years, as per the call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. However, it does not specify the target year as 2065.

4. "second draft law would close many women who choose not to have children" - This is not consistent with the article. The article states that the second draft law would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children, not that it would "close many women." The summary's phrasing is unclear and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.

In summary, points 1 and 2 are consistent with the article, while points 3 and 4 contain inconsistencies. Point 3 inaccurately specifies a target year that is not mentioned in the article, and point 4 misrepresents the impact of the second draft law on women's employment opportunities.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the draft legislation threatens to reduce Iranian women to 'baby-making machines.' It also mentions that a first bill would restrict access to contraception, Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065, and the second draft law would close many jobs to women who choose not to have children.
2. However, the article states that the draft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate threatens to reduce Iranian women to 'baby-making machines.' The summary is consistent with this part. The first bill is mentioned to restrict access to contraception, supporting the summary. Iran's goal to double its population to 150 million by 2065 is also supported. However, the article doesn't explicitly state that the second draft law would close many jobs to women who choose not to have children. This part of the summary introduces new information not directly supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary adds information about the second draft law closing many jobs to women who choose not to have children, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article.
