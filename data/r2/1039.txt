Article:
The newly-designed form, used to apply for a divorce in England and Wales, asks for the name "of the person your spouse has committed adultery with".
Family lawyers say that, in most cases, involving a third party adds "conflict and complexity".
The Ministry of Justice said there was "no obligation" to name people.
Lawyer Margaret Heathcote, vice-chairwoman of family law group Resolution, is one of those concerned about the form.
"Generally speaking, we don't name the third party. It increases the conflict from day one," she said.
"There's no need. But because the box is there, the indication will be to fill it in."
The online form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly - especially as some complete the process without seeking legal advice.
The guidance on the form highlights that it is "not normally necessary" to name the person your spouse committed adultery with.
But Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers, Vardags, said people are "unlikely to read the much smaller print or choose to ignore it".
The older version of the form left a space for so-called "co-respondents" to be named where appropriate.
"The new form flatly asks for 'the name of the person your spouse has committed adultery with'," Ms Hamblin explained.
"This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse."
If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case.
They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs.
According to the latest statistics, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015.
Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. "Unreasonable behaviour" accounted for 46,815.
Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery "want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them".
"But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that," she said.
"Judges take a very dim view of petitioners trying to bring in new partners and embroil them in proceedings."

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "It has always been possible for a petitioner to name the person they believe their spouse has committed adultery with on divorce application forms.
"As set out in the previous form, and more clearly in the new form, there is obviously no obligation to do so. This is a relevant part of divorce proceedings."

Summary:
divorce lawyers are being warned that they are being let down by a new form of divorce form.

GPT4:
The summary states that "divorce lawyers are being warned that they are being let down by a new form of divorce form." This statement is not consistent with the information provided in the article for the following reasons:

1. The article does not mention any warnings to divorce lawyers about being let down by the new form. Instead, it discusses the concerns of family lawyers regarding the potential for increased conflict when a third party is named in divorce proceedings due to adultery.

2. The article quotes family lawyers and a representative from the Ministry of Justice, who express their views on the new form. Lawyer Margaret Heathcote and Georgina Hamblin, director at divorce lawyers Vardags, share their concerns about the option to name the person with whom a spouse has committed adultery, but they do not mention being let down by the form itself.

3. The Ministry of Justice is quoted as saying there is "no obligation" to name the person involved in adultery and that naming them is "not normally necessary." This indicates that while the option is present, it is not a requirement, and therefore, it does not necessarily let lawyers down.

4. The article explains that the form has been updated to make the legal process more user-friendly and that the guidance on the form highlights the lack of necessity to name the third party. This suggests an intention to improve the process rather than to create a disadvantage for lawyers.

5. The article provides statistics on the reasons for divorce and quotes professionals' experiences with clients wanting to involve new partners in the proceedings. However, it does not frame these experiences as a letdown caused by the new form.

In conclusion, the summary's claim that divorce lawyers are being warned about being let down by the new form is not supported by the article. The article focuses on the potential for increased conflict when naming a third party in adultery cases and the professionals' perspectives on this issue, not on any warnings or letdowns experienced by lawyers due to the new form.
