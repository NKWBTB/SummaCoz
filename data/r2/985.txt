Article:
Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed.

I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.'

GPT4:
1. The summary begins with the statement "Ross Barkley has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League." This is inconsistent with the article, which states that it is Leighton Baines who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League, not Ross Barkley.

2. The summary then mentions that "Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty at the club." This is a vague statement and does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article discusses a specific incident where Martinez defended the decision to allow Barkley to take a penalty, rather than defending "another penalty at the club" in general.

3. The summary correctly states that "the untried Barkley took the 10th minute kick for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon." This is consistent with the article, which describes the same event.

In conclusion, the inconsistency in the summary lies in the incorrect attribution of the penalty scoring record to Ross Barkley instead of Leighton Baines, and the vague reference to Martinez defending "another penalty" without specifying the context of the incident.
