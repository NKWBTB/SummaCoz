Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.

GPT4:
The summary contains several statements that need to be checked for consistency with the article:

1. "A Pennsylvania man was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to him."
   - This statement is consistent with the article, which states that Kevin Rebbie was arrested after the girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom.

2. "The girl told investigators that Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com."
   - This statement is consistent with the article, which mentions that the girl told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years and that he would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her.

3. "Authorities say Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to the Pottstown Mercury."
   - This statement is redundant and repeats the previous point. It is consistent with the article, but it is unnecessary to mention the same fact twice, attributing it to two different sources (Philly.com and the Pottstown Mercury).

4. "The girl told investigators that Rebbie would come into her."
   - This statement is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence. It does not provide any new information and seems to be an error in the summary.

The inconsistency in the summary is the repetition and redundancy of the second and third points, which essentially repeat the same information about Rebbie molesting the girl. Additionally, the last sentence is incomplete and does not contribute to the summary. The summary should have consolidated the information about the molestation into a single clear statement and omitted the incomplete sentence.

HUMAN:

The summary states that Authorities say Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to the Pottstown Mercury but the article Pottstown Mercury only states that he had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered
2. The summary does not make any mention of Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail
