GPT4:
1. The summary starts by correctly stating that Gregory van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. This is consistent with the article, which mentions that Van der Wiel has expressed his happiness at PSG and his desire to stay.

2. The summary also correctly mentions that the Dutchman recently had a falling out with his boss Laurent Blanc. The article supports this by describing an incident where Van der Wiel was dropped for a Champions League clash against Chelsea, which led to a spat with the manager.

3. The summary then states that "the Parisians continue to be linked with a move to French champions." This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article does not suggest that Paris Saint-Germain, who are themselves the French champions, are linked with a move to another French champion. This part of the summary is confusing and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.

4. Lastly, the summary mentions that Dani Alves is being linked to move to the French champions league. This statement is not consistent with the article for two reasons. First, the term "French champions league" is incorrect; it should be "French champions," referring to Paris Saint-Germain. Second, the article states that Dani Alves is being linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain, not to a league. The article suggests that the potential arrival of Dani Alves at PSG could affect Van der Wiel's future at the club.

In conclusion, the inconsistency in the summary arises from the incorrect reference to "French champions" as a team that PSG is linked with moving to, and the misstatement about Dani Alves being linked to a move to the "French champions league" instead of to Paris Saint-Germain.

HUMAN:
1. The summary only mentions that Van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain, but it does not provide any context or information to support this statement.
2. The article also mentions that Paris Saint-Germain is being linked with a move for Barcelona star Dani Alves, which could potentially lead to Van der Wiel being sold. This key point is not mentioned in the summmary.
