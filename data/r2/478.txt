Summary:
a cat has died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park, the rspca has confirmed.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions that a seven-month-old cat named Meereen died after ingesting a toxic substance, which was confirmed to be antifreeze by the vets.

2. The article does not specify the location where the antifreeze was ingested. It does not mention a car park as the place where the poisoning occurred.

3. The RSPCA spokesman in the article states that it is unclear whether the poisonings were accidental or deliberate, which implies that the source of the antifreeze is not known.

4. The summary incorrectly states that the cat ate antifreeze in a car park, which is a detail not provided in the article. The article only suggests that antifreeze is commonly used in cars and advises people to ensure there are no leaks and to clean up any spills properly.

5. Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the summary's claim about the specific location of the poisoning (a car park), which is not supported by the information in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a cat has died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park, as confirmed by the RSPCA.
2. However, the article does not specifically mention that the cat died after eating antifreeze in a car park. It mentions that cats in the area had ingested a toxic substance, but the article doesn't provide details about the specific location or circumstances of the poisoning.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which adds specific details about the cat's death that are not present in the article.
