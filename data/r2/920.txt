That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings.

The investigation into Siler's death continues.
