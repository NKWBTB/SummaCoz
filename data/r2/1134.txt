Article:
It was the fourth time in a week a device - believed to be a World War Two munition - had been found in the city.
Roads around Matilda Street were sealed off at about 10:30 BST and traffic was diverted as police liaised with a military bomb disposal team.
The area was declared safe by South Yorkshire Police about four hours later.
Three devices were uncovered in the same area last Wednesday and a temporary cordon was put in place.

Summary:
a world war two bomb has been found in a street in sheffield.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions that a "device" believed to be a World War Two munition was found in the city, but it does not explicitly state that the device was a bomb. The term "munition" could refer to various types of military weaponry or ammunition, not necessarily a bomb.

2. The article specifies that the device was found on Matilda Street, but the summary generalizes the location to "a street in Sheffield." This is less specific than the information provided in the article.

3. The article indicates that this was the fourth such device found in a week, suggesting a series of discoveries, but the summary implies that only one World War Two bomb was found, which does not reflect the repeated nature of the findings as described in the article.

4. The summary does not mention the police response, the involvement of the military bomb disposal team, or the fact that the area was declared safe after four hours, which are all important details included in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately describes the nature of the device found (bomb vs. munition), generalizes the location of the discovery, fails to convey the repeated nature of such discoveries, and omits key details about the response and resolution of the incident.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that a World War Two bomb has been found in Sheffield, but the article does not mention the place sheffield.
