There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

the scottish government has been accused of " unfairly unfair " by a watchdog after a report found that a council tax system was not stored.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which mentions that the council tax system has inherent problems and that there has been a failure to modify it, leading to more difficulties for policymakers.

2. The article does not mention any accusations against the Scottish government by a watchdog. Instead, it states that the Scottish government, along with the council body Cosla, set up the commission to examine the local tax system.

3. The article quotes a Scottish government spokesman who acknowledges that the government considers the current council tax system to be unfair and has established the Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.

4. The summary incorrectly states that the Scottish government has been accused of being "unfairly unfair" by a watchdog. This statement is not supported by any information in the article. The article does not mention any watchdog making such an accusation.

5. The summary also incorrectly suggests that the report found that the council tax system was not stored. The article does not mention anything about the council tax system not being stored. Instead, it discusses the inherent problems with the council tax system and the challenges of reforming it.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it introduces an accusation that is not present in the article and misrepresents the content regarding the council tax system and the Scottish government's stance on it.
