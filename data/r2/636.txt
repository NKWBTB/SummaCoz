There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

Summary:
the local authorities in scotland have " serious problems " with the council tax system, a report has found.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which acknowledges that the council tax system has built-in problems and that a failure to modify it has created difficulties for policymakers. However, the term "serious problems" is not directly used in the article.

2. The article quotes Prof Kenneth Gibb's findings on the council tax system, mentioning that it is stable and difficult to avoid but also generates confusion among taxpayers and is perceived as unfair by some because it is not linked to current income. This indicates issues with the system but does not necessarily equate to "serious problems."

3. The article mentions that the commission will report back later in the year and that a public consultation will be held across Scotland before publishing its report. This suggests that the commission is still in the process of evaluating the system and has not yet concluded that there are "serious problems."

4. The Scottish government spokesman is quoted as saying that ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair," which is a critique of the system but does not specifically state that local authorities have "serious problems" with it.

5. The summary's claim that "the local authorities in Scotland have 'serious problems' with the council tax system" is not directly supported by the article. The article does not provide a specific statement from local authorities expressing that they have "serious problems" with the system. Instead, it provides an overview of the issues identified by the review and the government's stance on the fairness of the system.

In conclusion, the summary's claim is not consistent with the article because it uses the term "serious problems," which is not directly quoted or supported by the content of the article. The article discusses issues and concerns with the council tax system but does not attribute the phrase "serious problems" to local authorities in Scotland.

HUMAN:
1. The summary suggests that local authorities in Scotland have encountered significant issues with the council tax system, as described in a report.
2. However, the article discusses the problems and challenges associated with the council tax system but does not explicitly use the phrase or mention that local authorities in Scotland have "serious problems" with the system.
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of the specific phrase "serious problems," which is not directly supported by the article. The article conveys issues with the council tax system but doesn't use this exact wording.
