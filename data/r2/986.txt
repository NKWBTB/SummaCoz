GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies when compared to the article:

1. The summary states "patrick kluivert has been winning start in world cup qualifiers." This is a grammatically incorrect sentence, but it seems to imply that Patrick Kluivert has had a winning start, which is consistent with the article's statement that he made a winning start as coach of Curacao.

2. The summary correctly mentions that "the caribbean island team advanced to the second qualifying round in concacaf."

3. The summary states "patrick kluivert 's team won 4-3 on aggregate at montserrat to win." This is consistent with the article, which states that Curacao won 4-3 on aggregate after a 2-2 draw in the second-leg match.

4. The summary incorrectly states "the holland face 2-2 in a second-leg match at montserrat." This is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention "Holland" in the context of the match; it is Curacao that played Montserrat and ended with a 2-2 draw in the second-leg match. The use of "Holland" here is incorrect and misleading, as the article is discussing Curacao's team, not the Dutch national team.

The main inconsistency is the mention of "Holland" in the summary, which is not supported by the article. The article is about Curacao's team and their performance in the World Cup qualifying match, not about the Dutch national team.

HUMAN:
1. The summary fails to state that Kluivert's team won 2-1 on Saturday in Willemstad.
2. The summary fails to that that Curacao face Cuba in the next round, on June 8 and 16. Kluivert, whose mother is from Curacao, was a World Cup losing semi-finalist in 1998 as a player, and last year as assistant to coach Louis van Gaal which the article does and is very important to the summary.
