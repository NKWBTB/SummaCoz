GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the last sentence: "the competition will be announced on may 2 and 3."

The article states that Usain Bolt will compete at the IAAF/BTC World Relays on May 2 and 3, not that the competition will be announced on those dates. The event itself is already scheduled and announced to take place on those dates, and the Jamaican team, including Usain Bolt, is confirmed to be participating.

The correct statement should reflect that the competition will take place or occur on May 2 and 3, rather than being announced on those dates. The summary incorrectly suggests that the dates are for the announcement of the competition rather than the event itself.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the competition will be announced on May 2 and 3, which is not accurate as the competition has already been confirmed to take place on those dates.
2. The summary does not mention that Bolt will be part of the Jamaican team, which is a key detail that is included in the article.
