Article:
The 50 year-old said she was "lucky to be here" after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online.
O'Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched "women's heart attack symptoms", which included sudden nausea and aches, before taking a few aspirin.
She visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked.
O'Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became nauseous and feverish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Nyack village home, near New York.
In the blog entry on her website, a poem entitled "my heart attack", O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the "widow maker".
The star, who has acted in several films and TV shows including Drop Dead Diva, Will and Grace and Nip/Tuck, also said she did not call the emergency services.
However, she issued a warning to her readers: "Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911."
She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gameshow was cancelled in March due to low ratings.

Summary:
actress and actress rosie o \'donnell has had a heart attack after she was diagnosed with a heart attack.

GPT4:
The summary states that "actress and actress rosie o'donnell has had a heart attack after she was diagnosed with a heart attack." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons:

1. Repetition: The summary redundantly states that Rosie O'Donnell "has had a heart attack" twice in a row, which is not only grammatically incorrect but also does not reflect the flow of events as described in the article.

2. Sequence of Events: According to the article, Rosie O'Donnell experienced symptoms, searched for them online, and then took action by taking aspirin and visiting a cardiologist the next day. The diagnosis of a heart attack was not mentioned before she experienced the symptoms and took these actions. The summary incorrectly suggests that she had a heart attack after being diagnosed, which is not the sequence of events presented in the article.

3. Diagnosis: The article does not explicitly state that Rosie O'Donnell was "diagnosed with a heart attack" before experiencing one. Instead, it describes the symptoms she had, her online search, and the subsequent medical intervention where a cardiologist inserted a stent due to a blocked artery. The diagnosis is implied by the treatment (stent insertion) and her own recognition of the symptoms, but the article does not mention a formal diagnosis prior to her taking action.

4. The summary fails to capture key details from the article, such as the fact that she helped a woman from her car before experiencing symptoms, that she wrote a blog post about her experience, and that she warned others to be aware of heart attack symptoms.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately represents the sequence of events, repeats information unnecessarily, and omits important details from the original text.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Rosie O'Donnell has had a heart attack after she was diagnosed with a heart attack.
2. However, the article states that she visited a cardiologist the next day after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online. Thus, she had a heart attack before the diagnose.
3. The summary misuses a repetitive phrase "actress and actress".
