Summary:

GPT4:
1. The article does not mention anyone named Simon Stevens. Instead, it states that Dan Stevens will play the Beast.

2. The summary incorrectly states that the character being played is "the beauty of the beauty and the beast." According to the article, Emma Watson has been cast as Belle, who is the "Beauty" character in the story.

3. The term "West End film" is not used in the article. The West End typically refers to the theater district in London, and the article does not mention any connection to the West End. It simply states that the film will be released in US cinemas.

4. The article is about the live-action adaptation of Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," not a stage production or a film specifically for the West End.

Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly names the actor playing the Beast, misidentifies the character being played, and inaccurately refers to the production as a "West End film."

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Simon Stevens is to play the "beauty" in Disney's West End film of Beauty and the Beast.
