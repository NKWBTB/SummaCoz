When Utah photographer Alan Lawrence learned that his newborn son, Wil, had Down Syndrome his 'mind was flooded with many emotions, most of which were not positive.' Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog -- That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies and errors when compared to the article:

1. The summary states, "alan lawrence, created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, wil, had down syndrome his `mind was flooded with many emotions'." This sentence is not only grammatically incorrect but also misleading. The article mentions that Alan Lawrence's mind was flooded with many emotions when he learned that his newborn son had Down Syndrome, not when he created the photo series.

2. The summary suggests that the emotions Alan Lawrence felt were part of the photo series, which is not the case. The article clearly states that these emotions were his initial reaction to his son's diagnosis, not related to the photo series itself.

3. The summary does not mention the name of the photo series, "Wil Can Fly," which is a significant detail in the article.

4. The summary incorrectly implies that the father's creation of the illusion (by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out) was a response to Wil removing limits from the family. The article does not make this causal connection. The photo series is a creative project and a way to celebrate Wil's unique presence in their lives, not a direct consequence of Wil's impact on the family.

5. The summary fails to mention that Lawrence plans to donate half the proceeds from the calendar to two Down Syndrome foundations, which is an important aspect of the story.

6. The summary does not include any information about the Kickstarter campaign, the purpose of raising awareness about Down Syndrome, or Lawrence's hopes to help people overseas through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

7. The summary omits all the descriptive content about the various scenes in which Wil appears to be flying, which are detailed in the article and contribute to understanding the scope and creativity of the photo series.

In summary, the provided summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, omitting key details and misrepresenting the context and purpose of the photo series "Wil Can Fly."

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Alan Lawrence created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil, had Down Syndrome, and Lawrence believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish.
2. However, the article states that Alan Lawrence learned that his newborn son, Wil, had Down Syndrome, and it does not mention that Lawrence believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly attributes a belief to Alan Lawrence about the limitations of having a child with Down Syndrome, which the article does not support.
