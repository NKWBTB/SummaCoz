GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement "the mls side are also keen on signing adrian heath." This statement suggests that Orlando City is interested in signing Adrian Heath, which is not supported by the article. In fact, the article states that Adrian Heath is already the coach of Orlando City, not a player they are looking to sign. The rest of the summary is consistent with the article, as it discusses Orlando City's interest in Javier Hernandez and mentions that he would be a popular figure among the club's supporters due to the large Latin-American fanbase.

HUMAN:
