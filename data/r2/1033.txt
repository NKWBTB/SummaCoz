Article:
Dan Groves said the "finer points" of a deal which could see Wright buy 20% of the club are yet to be released.
The Sun reported that the 30-year-old will become a club director.
Billericay are eighth in the Isthmian League Premier Division, three points adrift of a play-off place.
Wright, who was runner-up in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2011, played non-league football for a succession of clubs, including Lewes, Crawley Town and Rushden & Diamonds.
Billericay have recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said shortly after completing a deal for the club that he was "comfortable" investing Â£10,000 a week.
The club signed former England international Paul Konchesky, 35, at the start of March.

Summary:
celebrity celebrity reality tv star peter wright is set to take over from celebrity reality tv star timericayericay town.

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The name "Peter Wright" is mentioned in the summary, but the article does not mention anyone by that name. The article talks about someone with the last name "Wright," but it does not provide a first name, so we cannot confirm that "Peter Wright" is the person being referred to.

2. The summary states that "Peter Wright" is set to "take over" Billericay Town. However, the article only mentions that Wright is potentially buying a 20% stake in the club, not taking it over. There is a significant difference between purchasing a minority stake and taking over a club.

3. The phrase "celebrity reality tv star timericayericay town" in the summary is nonsensical and does not match any information provided in the article. It seems to be a jumbled mix of words that do not convey a coherent message.

4. The article does not describe Wright as a "celebrity reality tv star." It mentions that he was a runner-up in "I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here" in 2011, which indicates his participation in a reality TV show, but the article does not use the specific phrase "celebrity reality tv star."

5. The article provides additional context about the club's current situation, such as their position in the Isthmian League Premier Division and recent takeover by Glenn Tamplin, which is not reflected in the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately represents the involvement of "Wright" with Billericay Town, uses a name not provided in the article, and includes a nonsensical phrase while omitting relevant details from the article.
