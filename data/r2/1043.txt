Summary:
real madrid have signed real madrid striker alvaro morata on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.

GPT4:
1. The article states that Morata is playing for Spain at Euro 2016 and joined Juventus in 2014 after four seasons with Real Madrid. This information does not indicate that Morata has signed a new deal with Real Madrid; it only provides background on his career up to the time of the article.

2. The article mentions that the terms of Morata's move to Juventus included an option for Real Madrid to buy him back, with the fee reported to be up to 30m euros. This suggests that Real Madrid had the option to re-sign Morata, but it does not confirm that they have exercised this option or that a deal has been completed.

3. The article discusses Morata's performance for Spain in Euro 2016 and his achievements with Juventus, including goals scored and titles won. It also mentions his previous time at Real Madrid. However, nowhere in the article does it state that Real Madrid has re-signed Morata.

4. The summary claims that Real Madrid has signed Alvaro Morata on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee. This statement is not supported by any information in the article. The article does not mention a new contract, the length of any deal, or the fee involved in such a transaction.

5. The inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary introduces new information about a four-year deal that is not present in the article. The article only discusses Morata's past transfers and his performance, without any current transfer news regarding a new contract with Real Madrid.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it claims a new signing of Alvaro Morata by Real Madrid that the article does not confirm or even mention.
