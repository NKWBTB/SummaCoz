Article:
Sidwell, 34, has made 32 Championship appearances this season to help the Seagulls achieve promotion to the top flight for the first time in 34 years.
With his contract due to expire at the end of the campaign, the midfielder is now hoping to sign a new deal.
"I want to be a part of it next year because I know we can stay in the Premier League," he said.
Brighton's recent win over Wigan confirmed their promotion, and with a four-point lead over second-placed Newcastle, Chris Hughton's side are now hoping to wrap up the league title in the final two matches.
Sidwell made 19 appearances for Albion on loan from Stoke during 2015-16 before signing a one-year deal with Brighton in June 2016.
He has previously played in the Premier League with Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Fulham and Stoke and believes he deserves the opportunity to play at the top level again.
Sidwell told BBC Radio Sussex: "When I signed the contract last year no-one expected me to play as many games as I have. I've probably given a better impact than expected.
"When I have played I've played well, I've put my best foot forward and I've given myself every opportunity to earn a new deal.
"If there's one on the table then hopefully we can thrash it out, it can be done and we can enjoy the summer."

Summary:

GPT4:
1. The article states that Sidwell is a midfielder, not a defender as mentioned in the summary. This is the first inconsistency.

2. The article mentions that Sidwell's contract is due to expire at the end of the campaign and that he is hoping to sign a new deal. There is no mention of him having already signed a new contract.

3. The summary claims that Sidwell has signed a new three-year contract. The article does not confirm that a new contract has been signed, let alone specify the duration of any such contract.

4. The article indicates that Sidwell is still in discussions about his future with the club, hoping to "thrash it out" and that if there is a contract on the table, they can finalize it. This implies that at the time of the article, no new contract had been signed.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states Sidwell's position, asserts that he has signed a new contract, and specifies a duration for the contract that is not mentioned in the article.

HUMAN:
