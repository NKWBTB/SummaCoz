The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The summary states that "the entire incident was caught on a manhole cover," which is nonsensical. The article actually says that the incident was caught on camera by a tourist, not on a manhole cover. The manhole cover was the object the guard slipped on, not the device that recorded the event.

2. The summary mentions "he lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking bearskin on the side of the box." The article does describe the guard slipping and knocking his bearskin on the side of the sentry box, but it does not specifically say that he slid sideways. The article mentions that he "slid sideways" in a different context, referring to the guard's legs getting tangled as he tried to turn to march away.

3. The summary refers to "holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manoeuvre outside Buckingham Palace." While the article does mention that David Meadwell recorded the incident, it does not refer to the incident as an "unscheduled manoeuvre," which could imply that it was a planned part of the ceremony. The term "unscheduled" is not used in the article, and the incident was clearly an accident, not a manoeuvre.

4. The summary states, "queen 's guard was left red-faced after he slipped on manhole cover." The article does mention that the guard was left red-faced, but it does not attribute this directly to slipping on the manhole cover. The guard's embarrassment is implied to be due to the public nature of the fall and the attention it garnered.

5. The summary does not mention that the guard was carrying a rifle, which is an important detail as the article specifies that he fell still clutching his rifle.

6. The summary omits the context provided by the article that the guard's slip might have been caused by the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots, which is relevant information to understand why the slip occurred.

7. The summary does not include the information about the frequency of the Changing of the Guard ceremony or the operational status of the Queen's Guard, which are details that add depth to the understanding of the event and the guard's role.

8. Lastly, the summary does not mention the Ministry of Defence's response to the incident, which is included in the article and provides an official perspective on the matter.

In summary, the inconsistencies arise from misrepresenting the cause of the

HUMAN:
1. The aricle states that the guard slipped on a manhole cover, but the summary does not mention any manhole cover. 
2. The article states that the guard dropped his rifle, but the summary does not mention the guard dropping his rifle.
3. The summary does not state that the incident was caught on a tourist's camera.
