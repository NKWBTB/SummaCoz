Article:
The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said.
The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.
Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.
Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.
Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage.
In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.
In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.
Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.
Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor "came out of nowhere", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - "medium-strong" and "fairly shallow".
Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.
Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.
The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided "inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.
At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.
On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.

Summary:
an earthquake in italy has killed at least 18 people, italian scientists say.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is that it claims "an earthquake in Italy has killed at least 18 people," which is not supported by the information provided in the article. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article mentions a magnitude-4.8 earthquake that struck near the city of Lucca, but there are no reports of fatalities in the immediate aftermath of this quake. The summary's claim of at least 18 deaths is not corroborated by the article.

2. The article does discuss past earthquakes in Italy, including one in 2009 in L'Aquila that killed almost 300 people and another set of quakes in May of an unspecified year that left more than 20 people dead. However, these events are historical and not related to the current earthquake being reported.

3. The article specifically states, "There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage" in relation to the current earthquake. This directly contradicts the summary's claim of fatalities.

4. The article does mention the aftermath of the L'Aquila earthquake and the conviction of scientists for giving a falsely reassuring statement before that quake. However, this information is about a past event and does not pertain to the current earthquake.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately attributes fatalities to the recent earthquake when the article does not report any deaths resulting from this event.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that "at least 18 people" were killed in the earthquake in Italy, while the article states that "there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage." This is a clear inconsistency, as the summary asserts that people were killed, while the article states that there were no reports of injuries or damage.
2. The summary quotes Italian scientists. However, the article does not mention any word from Italian scientists.
