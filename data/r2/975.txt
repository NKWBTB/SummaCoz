It's crunch time this weekend at the top of the Premier League as second-placed Arsenal host table toppers Chelsea - and it appears one star of the former's team cannot wait for the ever-nearing kick-off. Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch. The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from £299 to £13,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon.

Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift, comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider. Accompanied with the caption: 'Excited about my new cool gadget! It's just like Michael Knight's watch, but a real one #knightrider #phone,' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday. The midfielder, who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season, is expected to start for Arsene Wenger's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Arsenal trail the Blues by 10 points with six league games remaining - but have been boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere. Wilshere was on the bench in their FA Cup semi-final win over Reading at Wembley on April 18 after five months out through injury. And club legend Ray Parlour believes that the 23-year-old’s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield. ‘I think he’s the future of the club,’ said Parlour. ‘I think if he stays fit, he’s a quality player, there’s no doubt about that. Jack Wilshere (centre) was on the bench for Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading . Ray Parlour, who won three championships with Arsenal, has backed Wilshere to be the future of the club . ‘The way he goes past players, the way he links up with people, I definitely think he’s got a big role to play. ‘But again, the big question mark is can he stay fit? Look at Abou Diaby. Diaby’s a terrific player. But look at him, the injuries the last few years. ‘The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period, like he hasn’t had for the last three or four seasons.’ Wilshere, the England international, is pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week .

Summary:

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Mesut Ozil took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday." This is consistent with the article, which mentions that Ozil shared his joy at his latest gift on Instagram, comparing it to Michael Knight's watch from Knight Rider.

2. The summary mentions that "the 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in # 299." This is a partial inconsistency because the article states that the price of the Apple Watch ranges from £299 to £13,500. The summary fails to include the full price range and incorrectly uses the symbol "#" instead of the currency symbol "£."

3. The summary claims that "Ozil was on the bench for Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading." This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article does not mention Ozil's participation or position during the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. Instead, it talks about Jack Wilshere being on the bench for that match after returning from injury.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the incorrect claim about Ozil's involvement in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading, as the article does not provide any information to support this statement.

HUMAN:
1. The summary solely focused on Wilshere's apple watch, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
