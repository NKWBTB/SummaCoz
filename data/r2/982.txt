(CNN)After a Russian fighter jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an "unsafe and unprofessional manner" earlier this week, the United States is complaining to Moscow about the incident. On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were "unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed," Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will "file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it "one of the most dangerous close passes in decades." The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska. CNN's Steve Brusk and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.

Summary:

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement "u.s. command says the transponder was off was false." This statement suggests that the U.S. command is claiming that the transponder being off is a false statement. However, according to the article, it was the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman who reported that the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off. The U.S. European Command official refuted this claim, stating that the claim about the transponder being off was false.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that the Russian state news agency Sputnik reported, according to a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, that the U.S. plane was flying with its transponder switched off.

2. The article then mentions that an official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false, directly contradicting the Russian report.

3. The summary incorrectly attributes the statement about the transponder being off to the U.S. command, making it seem as though the U.S. command is the source of the claim, rather than the entity refuting it.

4. The correct summary should reflect that the U.S. European Command disputed the Russian claim about the transponder being off, not that the U.S. command is asserting the transponder was off. 

Therefore, the summary should be corrected to accurately represent the U.S. European Command's position on the transponder issue.
