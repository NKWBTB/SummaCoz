Article:
There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.  Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans. The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium .

Summary:
doncaster 's league one play-off draw at doncaster 's fleetwood town in league one . doncaster 's media team won the match on 0-0 with 0-0 draw . saturday 's visit was so it was 27 seconds for the kick off .

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies and errors when compared to the article:

1. The summary states "doncaster 's league one play-off draw at doncaster 's fleetwood town in league one." This is incorrect because the article does not mention that the match was a play-off draw. It simply states that Fleetwood Town's play-off hopes had all but evaporated, implying that this was a regular league match, not a play-off.

2. The summary also incorrectly states "doncaster 's media team won the match on 0-0 with 0-0 draw." This is inconsistent with the article, which clearly states that the match ended in a goalless draw, meaning neither team won. Additionally, a media team does not play in the match, so they cannot win a match.

3. The summary's phrase "saturday 's visit was so it was 27 seconds for the kick off" is confusing and does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article mentions that the media team faced a challenge in compiling the match highlights, which resulted in a very short highlights video of just 27 seconds. The summary does not clearly convey this information.

4. The summary suggests that the 27-second video was for the kick-off only, which is not accurate. The article states that the 27-second video included the kick-off, a goal kick, and the final whistle, not just the kick-off.

5. The summary ends abruptly and does not include any mention of the managers or the touchline, which is mentioned in the article as part of the scene during the goalless draw.

Overall, the summary fails to accurately represent the content of the article, contains factual inaccuracies, and is not coherent in its presentation of the information.
