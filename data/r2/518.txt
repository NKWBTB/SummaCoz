GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is the mention of two different ages at the time of Christopher Hogwood's death. The summary first states that "music conductor Christopher Hogwood has died at the age of 88," and then contradicts itself by saying, "said he has died at the age of 72."

To determine the correct age, we would need to refer to the article for accurate information. However, the article does not specify Christopher Hogwood's age at the time of his death. Without this information, we cannot confirm which age, if either, is correct.

The inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary provides two conflicting ages, which cannot both be true. Since the article does not provide an age, we cannot resolve this inconsistency based on the information given. The correct approach would be to either find the accurate age from a reliable source or omit the age from the summary if it is not mentioned in the article.
