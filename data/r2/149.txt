Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: ‘No, no, no, that’s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.’ The supplier, who has 35 years’ experience, says: ‘As you can see, they’ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they’ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can’t think there’s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.’ Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: ‘No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.’ Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’.

A great number suffer broken bones during this process.’ A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers ‘an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK’s most recognisable businesses’.

GPT4:
The summary contains several points that need to be checked against the article for consistency:

1. "kfc with 23million chickens a year can be shown for the first time."
   - The article does mention that KFC supplies 23 million chickens a year and that this is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC, which supports this part of the summary.

2. "images show tens of thousands of chickens kept together in huge sheds, alive."
   - The article describes images of around 34,000 chickens kept in a shed, which aligns with the "tens of thousands" mentioned in the summary.

3. "the farmer in charge claims it's 'a very good life'"
   - The article quotes the farmer, Andrew, as saying the chickens have 'a very good life' and that he 'wouldn’t mind being a chicken in here', which supports this part of the summary.

4. "the chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed."
   - The article states that the chickens are kept alive for just 35 days before they are gassed, which is consistent with the summary.

5. "supplier andrew in shed filled with 34,00 chickens destined for fast food chain kfc."
   - The article mentions a supplier named Andrew and a shed filled with around 34,000 chickens destined for KFC, but there is a typo in the summary ("34,00" should be "34,000"). Despite the typo, the information is consistent with the article.

Based on the points above, the summary appears to be consistent with the article, except for the typo in the number of chickens. However, the summary does not mention any of the negative aspects highlighted by animal rights campaigners, which are a significant part of the article. This omission could be seen as a lack of balance, but strictly speaking, the points included in the summary are consistent with the information provided in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the farmer in charge claims the chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, and it presents this information as a new revelation about the conditions on the farms supplying KFC.
2. However, the article states that the farmer, Andrew, claims the chickens at his farm have a good life, saying he 'wouldn’t mind being a chicken in here.' The summary does not accurately represent the farmer's perspective, as it focuses on the negative aspect of the chickens living for 35 days before being gassed, omitting the farmer's positive comments about their overall well-being.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the article implies the farmer sees the chickens as having a good life, while the summary states that the chickens live in conditions where they are gassed after 35 days.
