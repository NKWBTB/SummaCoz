Article:
Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury. Left-armer Irfan, who has taken eight wickets in five matches so far, underwent an MRI scan after sitting out Pakistan's seven-wicket win over Ireland on Sunday with pain in his hip. After an initial scan proved inconclusive on Monday, Irfan underwent further tests on Tuesday where it was confirmed the seven-foot bowler had suffered 'an obvious stress fracture in the pelvis', according to a Pakistan Cricket Board statement. Mohammad Irfan will take no further part in the World Cup after scans revealed he has a fractured pelvis . Irfan had taken eight wickets in the first five games for Pakistan before missing the Ireland match . Team physiotherapist Brad Robinson said: 'This injury rules Irfan out of the World Cup.' Pakistan face Australia on March 20 in Adelaide, with a potential semi-final against defending champions India at stake, should the latter beat Bangladesh.

Summary:

GPT4:
The summary provided is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The summary is incomplete and lacks crucial information. It states that "Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis," which is not a complete sentence and does not make sense as it stands. The article specifies that the reason for Irfan missing the remainder of the World Cup is due to a "pelvis injury," which is a critical detail omitted in the summary.

2. The summary fails to mention the nature of the injury. The article clearly states that Mohammad Irfan has "an obvious stress fracture in the pelvis," which is a specific diagnosis and not just a general pelvis injury. This is an important detail that changes the understanding of the severity of the injury.

3. The summary does not reflect the information provided about the diagnostic process. The article explains that Irfan underwent an MRI scan, and after an initial inconclusive scan, further tests confirmed the stress fracture. This information is not present in the summary.

4. The summary does not include the context of Irfan's performance in the World Cup or the impact on the team. The article mentions that Irfan had taken eight wickets in five matches and that Pakistan will consider calling up a replacement after the quarter-final. This information is relevant to understanding the significance of Irfan's injury for the team's prospects in the tournament.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it is incomplete, omits critical details about the nature of the injury, and fails to provide context about Irfan's contribution to the team and the implications of his absence for Pakistan's World Cup campaign.
