GPT4:
The summary contains several points that need to be checked for consistency with the article:

1. "Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao go head-to-head in Las Vegas on Saturday, May 2." - This statement is consistent with the article, which mentions the fight taking place on the next Saturday night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena on the Las Vegas Strip.

2. "The two boxers has revealed a dozen oddities about themselves in the build-up to the mega fight." - This statement is consistent with the article, which states that each fighter has revealed a dozen oddities about themselves.

3. "Ramen noodle soup is one of his favourite snacks and he doesn't like five star restaurants." - This statement is not consistent with the article. The article mentions that ramen noodle soup is one of Mayweather's favorite meals, not a snack, and it does not explicitly state that he doesn't like five-star restaurants. Instead, it mentions that he doesn't like ketchup or mustard on hot dogs but uses BBQ sauce, and that he gets a manicure and pedicure at home once a week during training camp, among other things. The article does not provide information about Mayweather's preference for restaurants.

The inconsistency lies in the last point, where the summary incorrectly refers to ramen noodle soup as one of Mayweather's favorite snacks and inaccurately suggests that he does not like five-star restaurants without any supporting information from the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao go head-to-head in Las Vegas on Saturday, May 2. The two boxers have revealed a dozen oddities about themselves in the build-up to the mega fight. Ramen noodle soup is one of Mayweather's favorite snacks, and he doesn't like five-star restaurants.
2. However, the article provides additional details about the oddities of both Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. The summary only mentions Mayweather's preferences, omitting information about Pacquiao's oddities and focusing on specific details about Mayweather.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that both Mayweather and Pacquiao have revealed oddities, but it only presents details about Mayweather, excluding information about Pacquiao's preferences and habits.
