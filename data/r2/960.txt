GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the phrase "she was found guilty of injuries to the head and neck." This statement is incorrect based on the information provided in the article. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that Vanessa Santillan, a 33-year-old Mexican national, was found dead in a flat in Fulham, south west London, with injuries to her head and neck. There is no mention of her being found "guilty" of anything.

2. The term "guilty" implies culpability or responsibility for a crime or wrongdoing, which is not applicable to the victim of a crime. Vanessa Santillan was the victim in this case, not the perpetrator.

3. The article mentions that a 23-year-old man was arrested in connection with her death and has been bailed, indicating that he is the one under investigation, not Vanessa Santillan.

4. The police are appealing for information from anyone who may have had contact with Miss Santillan before her death, which further supports the fact that she is the victim and not someone who has been found guilty.

5. The summary incorrectly suggests that Vanessa Santillan has been told to return to a London police station for further questioning. This is not possible as she is the deceased victim. It is the arrested man who has been told to return for further questioning.

Therefore, the summary contains a significant error by misrepresenting Vanessa Santillan as being found guilty of her own injuries, which is inconsistent with the information provided in the article.
