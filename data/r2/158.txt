Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.'

GPT4:
The summary contains several points that need to be checked for consistency with the article:

1. "Detectives are hunting for attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl." - This is consistent with the article, which states that detectives are looking for the attacker.

2. "Officers described the footage as 'harrowing' but released in an effort to identify the attacker." - This is consistent with the article, which mentions that the footage was described as 'harrowing' and was released to help identify the attacker.

3. "Attacker drags the girl from the bus stop into the front garden." - This is consistent with the article, which describes the attacker dragging the girl from the bus stop into a garden.

4. "Attacker is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin." - This is consistent with the article, which provides a description of the attacker as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin.

5. "The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins with a large stone." - This point is not consistent with the article. The summary is missing the crucial information about what the man did with the stone. According to the article, the man hit the girl with a large stone to subdue her before raping her. The summary incorrectly implies that the man begins an unspecified action with a large stone, omitting the violent and criminal nature of the act.

The inconsistency lies in the last point of the summary, which fails to accurately convey the severity of the attack as described in the article. The summary should have mentioned that the man hit the girl with the stone and then committed a brutal rape, as this is a critical aspect of the crime being reported.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that detectives are hunting for an attacker who pounced on an 18-year-old girl, and the officers released harrowing footage in an effort to identify the attacker. The attacker is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and he drags the girl from the bus stop into a front garden, where he forces her to the ground and attacks her with a large stone.
2. However, the article states that the attacker not only subjected the girl to a serious sexual assault but also left her for dead at the end of the attack. The summary does not include information about the sexual assault and the severity of the violence, which is a significant omission.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary focuses on the physical assault with a stone and the description of the attacker's origin but omits the crucial information about the sexual assault and the fact that the attacker left the victim for dead. This omission results in a less accurate and incomplete representation of the incident.
