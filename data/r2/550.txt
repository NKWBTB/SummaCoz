Summary:
plans have been submitted for a glass tower on the edge of southampton seafront.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses the redevelopment of the disused Fawley power station, not the construction of a new glass tower. The summary incorrectly suggests that a new structure is being planned.

2. The article mentions that the developers, Fawley Waterside, plan to transform the existing power station chimney into an attraction, not build a new tower. The summary fails to mention the repurposing of the existing chimney.

3. The article describes the chimney as part of a larger development that includes a marina, housing, and restaurants, as well as fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth. The summary does not capture this broader context of the development.

4. The article specifies that the power station closed in 2013 and that the site was sold to developers in 2016. The summary does not reference the history or current status of the power station.

5. The article states that an application for outline planning permission is due later in the year, with building potentially starting in 2018. The summary incorrectly implies that plans have already been submitted.

6. The article provides a quote from Aldred Drummond of Fawley Waterside, emphasizing the value of the existing chimney as a "signature piece of infrastructure." The summary does not reflect this sentiment or the intention to retain and enhance the existing structure.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it inaccurately suggests that a new glass tower is being planned for the Southampton seafront, whereas the article actually describes the redevelopment of an existing structure (the power station chimney) into an attraction as part of a larger development project.

HUMAN:
1. The summary mentions plans for a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront.
2. However, the article discusses plans for a glass structure at the disused Fawley power station, which is not located on the edge of Southampton seafront but rather on the western side of Southampton Water.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mentions the plan of glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront, while the article provides more detailed information about plans for a glass structure at the disused Fawley power station.
