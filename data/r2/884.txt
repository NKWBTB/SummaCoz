Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup, but coach Vicente del Bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat, insists Gerard Pique. Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters. 'We have a very clear idea of our playing style and we are able to count on people who are gradually making a place for themselves in the team.'

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Holland beat Spain 2-0 in the group stage in Brazil on Tuesday night." This is inconsistent with the article, which mentions that the 2-0 defeat by Holland occurred in a friendly match, not in the group stage of a World Cup. The article refers to a previous encounter during the 2014 World Cup group stage where Holland beat Spain 5-1, but the 2-0 defeat mentioned occurred in a different context.

2. The summary suggests that "Del Bosque will be hoping to find the right mix of players to the World Cup." This is inconsistent with the article, which does not mention the World Cup in the context of Del Bosque's current plans. Instead, the article discusses Del Bosque's efforts to find the right mix of players for Spain's berth at Euro 2016, which is a different tournament.

3. The summary includes a sentence, "Gerard Pique could make the right mix of players to the tournament." This is inconsistent and confusing for several reasons. Firstly, the article does not suggest that Gerard Pique is responsible for selecting or making the right mix of players; that responsibility lies with the coach, Vicente del Bosque. Secondly, the article does not specify which tournament is being referred to, whereas the summary seems to imply Pique has a role in team selection for a tournament. Lastly, the phrasing "could make the right mix of players to the tournament" is unclear and does not accurately reflect any information provided in the article.

In summary, the inconsistencies arise from incorrect context (friendly match vs. World Cup group stage), incorrect tournament focus (Euro 2016 vs. World Cup), and incorrect attribution of responsibilities (Del Bosque's role vs. Pique's non-existent role in team selection).

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Holland beat Spain 2-0 in the group stage in Brazil on Tuesday night, which is not accurate.
2. However, the article states that Spain lost to Holland 2-0 at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday. It also mentions that this defeat brought back memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup.
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the error that incorrectly states the location and context of the match and does not accurately represent the actual content of the article.
