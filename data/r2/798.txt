Article:
Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

GPT4:
1. The summary begins by stating that Emmanuel Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday. This is consistent with the article, which mentions that the post on Adebayor's Instagram account emerged on Sunday.

2. The summary then mentions that the Togo international said he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. This is also consistent with the article, which states that Adebayor had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team.

3. The summary states twice that "Adebayor's goal return has led to speculation over his future." This is where the inconsistency lies. The article does mention that Adebayor's inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future, but it does not specifically say that his goal return has led to speculation over his future. The article does mention that his goal return has become more modest and that he has not scored in the league for Spurs since a certain match, but it does not directly link this to speculation over his future.

4. The repetition of the same line about Adebayor's goal return leading to speculation over his future is also an error in the summary, as it is redundant to repeat the same point without adding new information.

In conclusion, the inconsistency in the summary is the direct statement that Adebayor's goal return has led to speculation over his future, which is not explicitly stated in the article. The article suggests his form and the rise of Harry Kane have affected his position in the team, but it does not explicitly link his goal return to speculation about his future.

However, the article does not provide information about the emergence of Adebayor's official Instagram account on Sunday, and it does not mention any recent statement from Adebayor about being committed to fighting for his place.
