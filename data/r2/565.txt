Summary:

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary arises from the incorrect identification of the person returning to "EastEnders." The summary incorrectly states that "eastenders actress barbara kemp has returned to eastenders," which suggests that an actress named Barbara Kemp is the one returning to the show. However, the article does not mention an actress by that name. Instead, the article discusses actor Ross Kemp, who is returning to the show to reprise his role as Grant Mitchell.

Here are the steps that identify the inconsistency:

1. The summary refers to "eastenders actress barbara kemp," which implies that there is an actress with the last name Kemp returning to the show.
2. The article, however, talks about Ross Kemp, who is an actor, not an actress, and his character's name is Grant Mitchell, not Barbara Kemp.
3. The article mentions that Ross Kemp is returning for "Barbara's final episodes," referring to the character Peggy Mitchell, played by Dame Barbara Windsor, not an actress named Barbara Kemp.
4. The article details Ross Kemp's history on the show and his reasons for returning, which are tied to the storyline involving Peggy Mitchell's character, not an actress returning to the show.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the incorrect naming and gender of the person returning to "EastEnders" in the summary. The summary should correctly state that actor Ross Kemp has returned to "EastEnders" to reprise his role as Grant Mitchell.
