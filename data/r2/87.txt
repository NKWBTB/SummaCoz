Article:
A Colorado woman accused of luring an expectant mother to a basement and cutting the baby from her belly will not be charged with murder. Catherine Olguin, a spokeswoman for the Boulder County District Attorney's Office, said prosecutors won't bring the charge in the baby's death, but she declined to say why or what charges Dynel Lane, 34, will face. Investigators say Lane lured Michelle Wilkins, 26, to her Longmont home March 18 with an ad on Craigslist offering baby clothes. Inside, police say, Lane attacked Wilkins and extracted her unborn baby girl. Scroll down for video . Dynel Lane (left)  will not be charged with murder for cutting out the baby of expectant mom Michelle Wilkins (right) Wilkins had gone over to Lane's Longmont, Colorado home (above) on March 18 after responding to a CraigsList ad for baby clothes . Lane's husband found the infant in a bathtub and rushed the child to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Wilkins survived the attack and was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. District Attorney Stan Garnett is expected to release more information Friday about the decision not to charge Lane with murder, and the coroner's office is expected to release the findings of an autopsy performed on the baby. The gruesome attack revived the highly-charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being. Even though the baby girl died, legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that Colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide. State legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights, and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014. Advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law. Naomi Garcia, 11, holds a sign in the direction of passing cars during a protest against Dynel Lane . Legal experts say a person can still be charged with homicide for an unborn child's death under existing Colorado law if the baby was alive outside the mother's body and the act that led to its death also occurred there. After rejecting a fetal homicide law in 2013, Colorado legislators did pass a measure that makes it a felony to violently cause the death of a mother's fetus. The maximum punishment under that provision is 32 years in prison. The maximum punishment for homicide in Colorado is the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Lane is expected to be formally charged on Friday.

lane's husband was found in a bathtub and rushed the child to the hospital.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is found in the statement that "Lane's husband was found in a bathtub and rushed the child to the hospital." This statement is incorrect based on the information provided in the article. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that "Lane's husband found the infant in a bathtub and rushed the child to the hospital," which indicates that it was the infant who was found in the bathtub, not Lane's husband.

2. The summary incorrectly suggests that Lane's husband was the one found in the bathtub, which is not supported by any information in the article.

3. The correct information, as per the article, should be that Lane's husband found the infant (not himself) in the bathtub and then took action to rush the child to the hospital.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the misrepresentation of who was found in the bathtub. The summary should accurately reflect that it was the infant who was found in the bathtub by Lane's husband, who then proceeded to rush the baby to the hospital.
