Article:
Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders. Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK, the Mail can reveal. Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Tighter measures: Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade. This would disclose whether they had a clean criminal record or had committed offences. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘This power will enable us to require those applying for a visa to provide a criminal record certificate covering the last ten years – an additional tool to help stop criminals from coming to our country.’ Some 1.9million people arriving on visitor visas, or those from 56 countries and territories which do not need visas, will not need to provide their criminal histories because this would be ‘disproportionate’ in terms of time, cost and bureaucracy. The system will also exempt under-18s, asylum seekers and those people where it is not ‘reasonably practicable’. Tougher stance: Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK .

Summary:
migrants who come to britain to live or work must prove they have committed a crime.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement that migrants must prove they have committed a crime. This is incorrect based on the information provided in the article. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years. This is a requirement for obtaining a visa to enter the UK.

2. The summary, however, inaccurately claims that migrants must prove they have committed a crime, which is the opposite of what the article says.

3. The article explains that the purpose of the new measures is to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Requiring proof of criminal activity would not align with this goal.

4. The article specifies that non-EU migrants will need to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country or any country they have resided in during the past decade to show whether they have a clean criminal record or have committed offenses.

5. The summary's claim is not only inconsistent with the article but also illogical in the context of tightening border security and immigration controls.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states that migrants must prove they have committed a crime, whereas the article clearly states that they must prove they have not committed a crime to be eligible for a visa to enter the UK.

HUMAN:
1. The article states that migrants must provide a criminal records certificate from their home country to prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years.
2. However, the summary states that migrants must prove they have committed a crime.
3. These two statements are contradictory, as one states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime, while the other states that they must prove they have committed a crime.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
