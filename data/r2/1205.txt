Article:
The English rider crashed at this year's TT and the Fireblade bike has been plagued by mechanical problems.
Martin told MCN that he was quitting road racing but he later clarifying his position on Facebook.
"I've not given up on racing or road racing but I've got no plans to do anymore road racing on the Hondas this year," he said.
Martin didn't race at the North West 200 after team-mate John McGuinness crashed in practice and he will not compete in next month's Ulster Grand Prix.
He added: "The TT was a bloody disaster, aside from walking the dog and racing the Mugen, I didn't enjoy it.
"It was clear even before that we were going to struggle and then it turned into me really being a test rider, which I did.
"But after we did more testing at Cadwell a few weeks back, I said to the team the bike won't be competitive at the Ulster Grand Prix and they decided to withdraw me from the event, although they didn't tell me, which is OK as the decision was made for me.
"There's no unfinished business and I want to race classics and oddball stuff."

Summary:
northern ireland\'s martin mcguinness has said he will not quit racing at the 2016 isle of man tt because of a mechanical problem.

GPT4:
1. The article does not mention "Northern Ireland's Martin McGuinness." Instead, it refers to an English rider, Guy Martin, and his teammate John McGuinness. The summary incorrectly identifies the rider as Martin McGuinness, who is a different person.

2. The article states that Guy Martin told MCN (Motorcycle News) that he was quitting road racing but later clarified on Facebook that he has not given up on racing or road racing. The summary incorrectly suggests that Martin McGuinness (which should be Guy Martin) said he will not quit racing at the 2016 Isle of Man TT, which is not mentioned in the article.

3. The article mentions mechanical problems with the Fireblade bike and that the TT was a disaster for Guy Martin, but it does not specifically state that he will not quit racing because of a mechanical problem. The summary incorrectly attributes the decision not to quit racing to a mechanical problem.

4. The article also mentions that Guy Martin did not race at the North West 200 and will not compete in the Ulster Grand Prix, but it does not mention the 2016 Isle of Man TT in the context of quitting racing. The summary incorrectly connects the decision not to quit racing to the 2016 Isle of Man TT.

5. The article concludes with Guy Martin expressing his interest in racing classics and oddball stuff, which indicates a shift in his racing interests rather than a definitive statement about quitting racing altogether.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the incorrect identification of the rider, the misrepresentation of the rider's statements regarding quitting racing, and the incorrect connection to the 2016 Isle of Man TT and a mechanical problem.
