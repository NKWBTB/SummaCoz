GPT4:
1. The article does not mention the "chief executive of the republic of ireland council." Instead, it refers to individuals associated with a local authority, but there is no indication that this authority is in the Republic of Ireland.

2. The article mentions a person named Angela Scott as the council chief executive. The summary incorrectly refers to the chief executive as "he," while the article implies that Angela Scott is likely a woman.

3. The article does not state that the chief executive is leaving or not standing in the job. Instead, it mentions the departure of three other individuals: Richard Ellis, Ciaran Monaghan, and Ewan Sutherland.

4. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, which is about the departure of specific staff members from a local authority and not about the chief executive's intentions regarding their position.

Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the chief executive's gender, suggests that the chief executive is leaving (which the article does not state), and wrongly implies that the council is in the Republic of Ireland.
