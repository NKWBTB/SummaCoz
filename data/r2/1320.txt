Article:
Thomas Baker, known as Tommy, was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in the Old Swan area of Liverpool on 27 January.
The 44-year-old, from Everton, had been shot in the head and chest. He died later in hospital.
The three Liverpool men arrested - two aged 29 and the other 32 - remain in police custody for questioning.
Merseyside Police said Mr Baker had left Phoenix Gym at the market shortly before he was shot while getting into his car.
Detectives believe those involved in the shooting had been waiting outside the gym for about an hour.
Det Ch Insp Bev Hyland said officers were still searching for a silver VW polo, which "left the scene at speed" and travelled along a number of roads including Balmoral Road, Molyneux Road and Queens Road.
She added that a number of people captured on CCTV near the meat market had yet to come forward and while "they may not think what they saw would be of any significance, they could have information which is key to our inquiries".

Summary:
a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was shot dead in liverpool.

GPT4:
1. The article states that Thomas Baker was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in Liverpool and later died in the hospital from gunshot wounds to the head and chest.

2. The article mentions that three Liverpool men were arrested in connection with the shooting, but it does not specify that any of them have been charged with murder. They are described as being in police custody for questioning.

3. The summary simplifies the situation by stating that "a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder," which implies that only one individual has been arrested and that this person has been arrested specifically on suspicion of murder.

4. The inconsistency lies in the number of individuals arrested (three, not one) and the lack of information in the article about any formal charges of murder being made against the arrested individuals at the time of the report.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately represents the number of arrests and the nature of the charges or suspicions at that stage of the investigation.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but the article does not mention any arrests.
2. The article states that three men were arrested, but the summary only mentions one man.
