Summary:
scotland\'s laura muir is to miss the commonwealth games in london next month because she is missing the commonwealth games.

GPT4:
1. The article states that Laura Muir will miss the Commonwealth Games because they are scheduled for April on Australia's Gold Coast, not in London. The summary incorrectly states that the games are in London next month.

2. The reason given by Muir for missing the games is due to her veterinary medicine studies and exams in May, which conflict with the timing of the Commonwealth Games in April. The summary does not mention this reason and instead repeats the fact that she is missing the games without explanation.

3. The article mentions that Muir is focused on her studies to complete her final year and that she has to think about getting her degree, which is important to her. This detail is omitted in the summary.

4. The summary incorrectly states that the Commonwealth Games are "next month," whereas the article does not specify the exact month the interview or statement was made, only that the Commonwealth Games are in April of the following year.

5. The summary does not reflect Muir's sentiments about missing the games, where she expresses that she is "gutted" and wishes the Scotland team well, nor does it mention her potential target of the World Indoor Championships in March, which is discussed in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states the location and timing of the Commonwealth Games, omits the reason why Muir will miss the games, and fails to capture other relevant details provided in the article.
