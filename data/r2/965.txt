GPT4:
1. The summary states that "fans will see Aidan Turner's new baby daughter as Sunday night's episode." This is inconsistent with the article, which specifies that the baby will be seen within ten minutes of "tomorrow night’s episode," not Sunday night's episode. The article does not mention which day of the week the episode airs, so we cannot confirm that it is a Sunday night episode.

2. The summary also states, "last week, Demelza Poldark is now the mother to the show's tv episode." This sentence is confusing and does not accurately reflect the information in the article. The article mentions that "last week she was barely showing," referring to Demelza's pregnancy, and now she is the mother to the show's latest addition, meaning she has given birth to a baby. The phrase "the mother to the show's tv episode" does not make sense in this context.

3. Lastly, the summary mentions that "Demelza Poldark has been eight months pregnant." This is consistent with the article, which states that at the start of the next episode, Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant. However, the summary omits the criticism from the article about the unrealistic timeline of the pregnancy, which is a significant point of discussion in the article.

In conclusion, the summary contains inaccuracies and confusing statements that do not accurately represent the content of the article, particularly regarding the timing of the episode airing and the phrasing about Demelza being a mother to the show's latest addition.

HUMAN:
1. The summary does not mention the timeline of the pregnancy, which is a significant inconsistency with the article, as the article states that the pregnancy has progressed rapidly, with the last month passing in less than the blink of an eye.
2. The summary does not mention the fact that the pregnancy was announced in the previous episode, and that the next episode will show Demelza giving birth. This is a significant omission, as it is a key plot point in the article.
