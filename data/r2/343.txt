Article:
(CNN)The first daughter to be married from the hit reality show "19 Kids and Counting" has also become the first mother. People magazine reports that Jill (Duggar) Dillard gave birth Monday to a 9-pound, 10-ounce son she and husband Derick have named Israel David. Jill's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, posted a video of the new family on their official Facebook page. The baby was a bit tardy, going past his due date by more than a week. Dillard, who is a student midwife, said she gave herself two due dates and was prepared for the wait. "I have told myself, 'First-time moms often go a week and a half over, so don't get discouraged,' " she told People. "When everyone else is asking you, 'When are you going to have that baby?' The baby will come when the baby comes." Dillard has a ways to go to catch up with her mother. Her super-sized family and their lives have been well-documented on their TLC series, including Jill and Derick's wedding on June 21. Eldest Duggar son Josh is already the father of three children, and his wife, Anna, is expecting their fourth in July.

GPT4:
1. The article states that Jill (Duggar) Dillard gave birth to a son named Israel David.

2. It mentions that Jill's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, posted a video of the new family on their official Facebook page.

3. The article notes that the baby was a bit tardy, going past his due date by more than a week.

4. However, the article does not explicitly state that Jill's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, said the baby was tardy. It simply reports the fact that the baby was overdue without attributing this statement to anyone in particular.

5. The summary incorrectly attributes the observation about the baby being tardy to Jill's parents, which is not supported by the article. The article provides the information as part of the narrative without quoting Jill's parents on this matter.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the attribution of the statement about the baby's tardiness to Jill's parents in the summary, which is not found in the article.
