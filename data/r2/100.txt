Hong Kong (CNN)The search is on for China's teen top guns. China said Monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits. The schools, in 11 provinces across the country, will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16, the China Daily reported. Successful applicants will receive flight training and "military standard" physical training in addition to their regular high-school studies. It's the latest attempt by the People's Liberation Army's air force to attract more talent. Last year, it said it would require wannabe pilots to take psychological assessments and a flight simulation test. China's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power in the pursuit of what President Xi Jinping has called "balanced strength." "China has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft, but it must make sure there can be sufficient, well-trained pilots to fly them," Wang Ya'nan, deputy editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine told The China Daily last month. The recruits will receive a stipend and board at the schools. Traditionally, serving in the military has not been a sought-after career in China and a U.S. report on China's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge. Many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education, while country's one-child policy, which has created the "little emperor" phenomenon of spoiled children, produces recruits who "may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline," the report added. To this end, China has been making efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates as it modernizes its armed forces. On completing the three-year program, students will take a pilot selection test, and those who pass will join a PLA flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes.

The summary provided states that "the latest attempt by the people's air force will attract more talent." To determine the consistency of this summary with the article, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the article.

1. The article mentions that "China said Monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits." This indicates that the initiative is indeed an attempt to attract more talent to the air force.

2. The article specifies that "The schools, in 11 provinces across the country, will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16." This detail supports the idea that the initiative is targeting young talent for future pilot training.

3. The article also states that "Successful applicants will receive flight training and 'military standard' physical training in addition to their regular high-school studies." This further confirms that the program is designed to develop talent with the specific skills needed for the air force.

4. The article does not mention "the people's air force" but refers to the "People's Liberation Army's air force." The summary's reference to "the people's air force" is not consistent with the terminology used in the article.

5. The article provides context for the initiative, explaining that "China's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power." This context aligns with the summary's implication that the initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance the air force's capabilities.

6. The article also discusses the challenges faced by the Chinese military in recruiting well-qualified individuals and the efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates. This supports the summary's claim that the initiative is a new attempt to attract talent.

Based on the analysis, the summary is largely consistent with the article, except for the minor discrepancy in the terminology used to refer to the air force. The article uses "People's Liberation Army's air force," while the summary shortens this to "the people's air force." Despite this slight inconsistency in terminology, the essence of the summary captures the main point of the article, which is the attempt by China's air force to attract more talent through a new pilot training program in selected high schools.
