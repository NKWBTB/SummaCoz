Article:
Pte Matthew Boyd, 20, was off-duty on a night out in Brecon when he was punched and beaten by Jake Vallely.
But the jury cleared Vallely's friend Aaeron Evans of manslaughter after Cardiff Crown Court was told he was not present during the attack.
Vallely, 24, will be sentenced on 8 December.
The unconscious body of Pte Boyd, who served with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, was found by police in the town in the early hours of 8 May.
Pte Boyd, who is originally from Carrickfergus, County Antrim, had been in the town for training exercises at the infantry battle school.
During the trial, the court heard Pte Boyd was making his way back to the barracks when he was attacked outside a bar called The Cellar.
CCTV footage showed the soldier being punched, going to the ground and being beaten until he no longer moved.
Vallely then dragged his body from the scene before fleeing.
The trial was told the killer had been on a seven hour drinking binge and in the hour before the attack was boasting he was the "hardest man in Brecon".
His friend Mr Evans was cleared of any involvement in the attack, after the jury was told he had left the scene before the start of any violence.
Senior investigating officer Det Supt David Guiney, from Dyfed-Powys Police, called the attack "a despicable act" that "shocked" the community of Brecon.
"I plead with anyone who plans a night out drinking with their friends to please, walk away from any conflict, do not resort to violence," he said.
A family tribute described Pte Boyd as an "all-rounder" who had "a promising career ahead of him which has been cut short".
The tribute read: "Matthew was full of life. He was loving, caring and loyal. He was always playing jokes on his peers and family, and always brought smiles to our faces."
It said Vallely had created "a void in our family that will never be filled", adding the "unbearable pain" was something they will have to live with for the rest of their lives.
"During this trial, it has been mentioned that Jake Vallely called himself the 'hardest man in Brecon' on the night that he murdered Matthew," the tribute said.
"He couldn't have been more wrong. There has been such a massive outpouring of love from the community in Brecon towards our family; in our mind, those are the strongest people in Brecon."

Summary:
a soldier has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a soldier who was attacked in a bar in cardiff.

GPT4:
1. The location of the attack is incorrect in the summary. The article states that Pte Matthew Boyd was attacked in Brecon, not Cardiff. The trial took place at Cardiff Crown Court, but the incident itself occurred in Brecon.

2. The summary incorrectly states that the attack happened in a bar. The article mentions that Pte Boyd was attacked outside a bar called The Cellar, not inside it.

3. The summary does not specify the name of the soldier found guilty. The article clearly states that Jake Vallely was the person convicted of the attack.

4. The charge mentioned in the summary is manslaughter, but the article implies that the attack was fatal and refers to Vallely as the "killer" and mentions "the night that he murdered Matthew." This suggests that the charge may have been more severe than manslaughter, potentially murder, although the article does not explicitly state the exact charge for which Vallely was convicted.

5. The summary does not mention the acquittal of Vallely's friend, Aaeron Evans, who was cleared of manslaughter, which is a significant detail in the context of the case.

6. The summary fails to capture the key details of the incident, such as the fact that Vallely was on a drinking binge, boasted about being the "hardest man in Brecon," and dragged Pte Boyd's body from the scene.

For these reasons, the summary is not consistent with the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that a soldier has been found guilty of the manslaughter of another soldier who was attacked in a bar in Cardiff.
2. However, the article states that Jake Vallely, the man who attacked Pte Matthew Boyd, was found guilty of manslaughter, not a soldier.
3. The summary does not mention the name of the soldier who was found guilty, while the article clearly states that it is Jake Vallely.
4. The summary does not provide any information about the attack or the circumstances leading up to it, while the article provides detailed information about the incident, including the CCTV footage and the victim's background.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not provide accurate information about the case and does not mention the name of the person found guilty.
