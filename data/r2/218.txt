The Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life', pictured at George's christening in 2013 . Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life’. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne’s frustrations is the so-called ‘Middletonisation’ of his son William’s life — specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole’s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called ‘March of the Middletons’ that he has complained to friends: ‘They never let me see my grandson.’ Adds a source: ‘Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.’ It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it’s a deliberate move on William’s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles’s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate’s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot’s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William’s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

GPT4:
The summary contains several points that need to be checked against the article for consistency:

1. The Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life'.
   - This statement is consistent with the article, which mentions that the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather in the same way.

2. The heir-to-the-throne amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole.
   - This statement is not clear and seems to be missing some words to make sense. However, the article does discuss the Prince of Wales's concerns about the amount of time his son, Prince William, spends with his in-laws, Michael and Carole Middleton.

3. Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role.
   - This statement is consistent with the article, which states that Charles is said to be perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in Prince George's life.

4. Prince Charles is said to be frustrated at the so-called 'Middletonisation' of his son William.
   - This statement is consistent with the article, which mentions that Prince Charles is frustrated with the 'Middletonisation' of Prince William's life, referring to the influence of the Middleton family.

The inconsistency in the summary lies in the second point, which is not clearly articulated and does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article discusses Prince Charles's frustration with the amount of time Prince William spends with the Middletons, not the heir-to-the-throne's own time spent with them. The summary should be revised to clearly state that it is Prince William who is spending a significant amount of time with his in-laws, leading to Prince Charles's frustration.
