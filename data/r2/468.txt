Summary:
a fire at a waste processing plant in greater manchester has been suspended after a fire broke out at the site.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary arises from the phrase "a fire at a waste processing plant in greater manchester has been suspended." This phrase suggests that the fire itself has been suspended, which is not possible as a fire cannot be suspended; it can be extinguished or put out. The correct information from the article is that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire. The suspension is not of the fire, but of the company's operations as a result of the fire.

Here's the step by step reasoning:

1. The article states that firefighters spent several days at the site following the blaze, which indicates that there was a fire at the waste processing plant.

2. The article mentions that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire. This indicates that the company's operations were suspended, not the fire itself.

3. The summary incorrectly states that "a fire... has been suspended," which is a misinterpretation of the actions taken by the EA.

4. The correct summary should reflect the suspension of the company's operations as a result of the fire, not the suspension of the fire itself.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately describes the suspension as being of the fire rather than the company's waste processing operations.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a waste processing plant in Greater Manchester has been suspended after a fire broke out at the site.
2. However, the article mentions that Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, the company running the site, has been suspended from accepting waste by the Environment Agency (EA) due to reasons not directly related to the fire. The article does discuss the fire incident, but it does not directly attribute the suspension to the fire.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary that suggests the suspension is primarily a result of the fire, whereas the article clarifies that the suspension is related to waste management and environmental issues, which may or may not be connected to the fire incident.
