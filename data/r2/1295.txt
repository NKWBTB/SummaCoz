Article:
Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday, with almost 10% of pupils failing to reach the academy's standards.
Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures.
But Hanson Academy claims it "communicated clearly" its expectations for this school year.
Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers.
Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed.
Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday.
She said in an earlier statement: "We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.
"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.
"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn."
The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for "adult life".
She said: "This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect.
"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other.
"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school."
Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes.
She said: "It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather."
She said buying new shoes was not an easy option.
"I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important."
Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps.
"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes," she said.
Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home.
Fiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: "Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00.
"So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon."
The school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents.
She said the school would work with parents who were struggling to dress their children appropriately.

Summary:
pupils at a west yorkshire academy have been banned from wearing high-flying shoes after complaints they were made against them.

GPT4:
The summary states that "pupils at a west yorkshire academy have been banned from wearing high-flying shoes after complaints they were made against them." This statement is inconsistent with the article for several reasons:

1. The article does not mention "high-flying shoes" at all. Instead, it discusses the enforcement of a school uniform policy at Hanson Academy, which includes rules about the type of footwear allowed. The policy specifies that students must wear black shoes, lace-up, no trainers, and flat-soled.

2. The article does not indicate that the ban on certain types of shoes was a result of complaints against them. Rather, it describes the school's uniform policy as part of a broader push on conduct, behavior, attitudes, and respect.

3. The article provides examples of students being sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes and black pumps, but there is no mention of "high-flying shoes" or a ban specifically targeting them.

4. The article is focused on the school's strict enforcement of its uniform policy and the reactions from parents, some of whom are struggling to afford the required items. It does not frame the issue around a specific type of shoe or complaints about such shoes.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary introduces a claim about "high-flying shoes" that is not supported by any information in the article. The article's actual content is about the enforcement of a specific school uniform policy, which includes rules about appropriate footwear, but does not mention any ban related to "high-flying shoes."

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that pupils at a West Yorkshire academy have been banned from wearing high-flying shoes.
2. The article does not mention anything about high-flying shoes. Instead, it talks about the school's strict uniform policy, which includes rules about earrings, trousers, hair color, and footwear.
