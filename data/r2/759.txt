GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The summary incorrectly states that "pga tour star rickie fowler accused alexis of being a `gold digger'." This is not true. The article clearly states that it was an online hater, a troll known as 'fatalsplash,' who accused Alexis Randock of being a 'gold digger,' not Rickie Fowler. Fowler actually defended his girlfriend against this accusation.

2. The summary also incorrectly states that "alexis also was quick to judge and accused of working at mcdonald's." The article does not mention Alexis Randock accusing anyone of working at McDonald's. Instead, it was other posters who criticized the troll 'fatalsplash,' suggesting that he might work at McDonald's.

3. The summary mentions that "alexis randock's user name was called `fatalsplash'." This is incorrect. 'Fatalsplash' was the username of the online hater who accused Alexis of being a 'gold digger.' Alexis Randock is the girlfriend of Rickie Fowler, and there is no indication in the article that her username was 'fatalsplash.'

4. Lastly, the summary states that "the golfer's girlfriend has now earned extra brownie points." This phrase is ambiguous and does not clearly reflect the content of the article. The article mentions that Rickie Fowler has earned extra brownie points with his fans for defending his girlfriend, not that his girlfriend earned brownie points.

In summary, the inconsistencies are due to incorrect attributions of actions and statements, as well as a misunderstanding of the usernames and the context of who earned "extra brownie points."

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that a troll called 'fatalsplash' accused Alexis Randock of being a 'gold digger,' and both Rickie Fowler and Alexis responded to this accusation.
2. However, the article states that 'fatalsplash' is the one who accused Alexis Randock of being a 'gold digger' and that Rickie Fowler and Alexis Randock responded to this accusation. The article provides the correct sequence of events.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary that suggests that Alexis Randock accused herself of working at McDonald's. This is not accurate; the article correctly attributes the accusation to 'fatalsplash' and the responses to Rickie Fowler and Alexis Randock.
