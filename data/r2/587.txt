A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded.Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win.The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties.More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up.However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break.Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.Gloucester: Marshall; Sharples, Trinder, Twelvetrees, May; Burns, Heinz (capt); McAllister, Hibbard, Hohneck, Savage, Thrush, Moriarty, Rowan, Morgan.Replacements: Matu'u, Thomas, Afoa, Galarza, Ludlow, Braley, Atkinson, Purdy.Cardiff Blues: Morgan; Cuthbert, Lee-Lo, Shingler, Scully; Anscombe, Williams; Jenkins (capt), Dacey, Filise, Earle, Hoeata, Warburton, Navidi, Williams.Replacements: Rees, Domachowski, Assiratti, Cook, Bennett, Williams, Halaholo, Summerhill.Referee: Pascal Gauzere (France)For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.

Summary:
gloucester maintained their 100% start to the european champions cup with a bonus-point win over gloucester at kingsholm.

GPT4:
1. The article discusses a match between Gloucester and Cardiff Blues, not Gloucester versus Gloucester. The summary incorrectly states that Gloucester played against themselves.

2. The article does not mention the European Champions Cup; instead, it refers to a European Cup competition, which could be the European Rugby Challenge Cup, given the context of Gloucester having won the competition in 2015 and going out at the quarter-final stage last year. The European Champions Cup is a different, higher-tier competition.

3. The article does not state that Gloucester maintained a 100% start to the competition. It only mentions the outcome of this particular match and some historical context about Gloucester's performance in previous years.

4. The article does mention a bonus-point win, but this is in the context of Gloucester scoring four second-half tries, which is a detail specific to rugby union scoring rules that award a bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match.

5. The summary fails to mention Cardiff Blues at all, which is a significant omission since they are the opposing team in the match described in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the teams involved, the competition being played, and omits the performance and participation of Cardiff Blues.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states, "Gloucester maintained their 100% start to the European Champions Cup with a bonus-point win."
2. However, the article does not mention the European Champions Cup, nor does it confirm or provide information about Gloucester's 100% start in this competition. The article discusses a rugby match between Cardiff Blues and Gloucester, detailing the events and scores during the game.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary making a specific claim about Gloucester's performance in the European Champions Cup, which is not supported or addressed in the article. The article focuses primarily on the match itself.
