Summary:
bbc wales \'leanne jones has announced that a baby boy has been born to a father.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions that the individual who revealed the news of the baby's birth is from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire. However, the summary refers to "Leanne Jones," but the article does not mention any name. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may have incorrectly named the person or is referring to a different individual.

2. The article states that the news was revealed live on BBC One's The One Show, but the summary does not mention this detail. While this omission doesn't necessarily make the summary inconsistent, it does leave out a significant context of how the announcement was made.

3. The article specifies that it is "Miss Jones'" first child with her partner Charlie Thomson. The summary, however, does not mention Charlie Thomson and instead refers to "a father," which is vague and does not confirm that Charlie Thomson is the father as stated in the article.

4. The article provides specific details about the baby, including the time of birth (in the morning of Sunday, 22 January) and the weight (7lbs 11). The summary does not include any of these details, which again, while not inconsistent, is less informative.

5. The article uses "Ms Jones" to refer to the individual, while the summary uses "Leanne Jones." The use of a different name without confirmation from the article creates inconsistency in the identity of the person being discussed.

6. The article mentions that Ms. Jones had concerns about fertility after filming a documentary, which is not mentioned in the summary. This is additional context that is not reflected in the summary.

In conclusion, the inconsistency arises primarily from the use of a name, "Leanne Jones," in the summary that is not mentioned in the article. The summary also lacks specific details provided in the article and uses vague language ("a father") instead of the specific name of the partner, Charlie Thomson.

HUMAN:
1. The summary mentions Leanne Jones.
2. However, the article does not mention Miss Jones's first name is Leanne.
