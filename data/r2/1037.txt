Article:
No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful.
And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF).
Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?
Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.
Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.
Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA ("there is no alternative").
What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.
Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.
Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).
There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.
So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.
Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.
So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.

Summary:
it\'s easy to imagine that the new eurozone president, alexis tsipras, is in the hands of the rest of europe.

GPT4:
The summary contains a statement that is inconsistent with the information provided in the article. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the inconsistency:

1. The article discusses the situation in Greece, focusing on the government led by Alexis Tsipras and the Syriza party. It mentions austerity measures, the influx of tourists, and the economic challenges faced by the country.

2. The article states that Alexis Tsipras is the leader of Greece and mentions his political party, Syriza. It talks about the measures his government is poised to implement and the financial bailout they are negotiating.

3. The article does not mention anything about Alexis Tsipras being the "new eurozone president." Instead, it refers to him as the leader of Greece who is dealing with the country's economic issues and negotiations with creditors.

4. The term "eurozone president" is not a recognized position. The eurozone has different leadership roles, such as the President of the Eurogroup, which is a meeting of the finance ministers of the eurozone countries. However, the article does not attribute any such role to Alexis Tsipras.

5. The summary's claim that Alexis Tsipras is the "new eurozone president" is not supported by any information in the article. This creates an inconsistency, as the article does not assign any eurozone-wide leadership role to Tsipras.

In conclusion, the inconsistency lies in the summary's incorrect attribution of the role of "new eurozone president" to Alexis Tsipras, which is not a position mentioned or implied in the article. The article only discusses Tsipras in his capacity as the leader of Greece.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that Alexis Tsipras is in the hands of the rest of Europe, implying that he has surrendered to their demands.
2. However, the article states that Tsipras is still popular despite failing to deliver an end to austerity, and that he has conceded to obtain a new bailout.
3. The article also mentions that Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze and that the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.
4. The article does not support the idea that Tsipras is in the hands of the rest of Europe, as it highlights his popularity and the challenges faced by Greece.
