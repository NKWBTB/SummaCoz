Summary:
police investigating the murders of two british tourists on the thai island of kodge are to travel to thailand, the prime minister has said.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the timing of the events described in the article versus what is stated in the summary. The summary suggests that the police are planning to travel to Thailand, indicating a future action. However, the article clearly states that the Metropolitan Police officers "flew out last month to work with Thai police," which indicates that the travel has already occurred. Additionally, the article mentions that the UK detectives "have completed their work, as far as possible," and are now returning to the UK to compile their report. This further confirms that the visit to Thailand has already taken place and is not a future event as the summary implies.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that police investigating the murders of two British tourists on the Thai island of Kodge are to travel to Thailand, according to the Prime Minister.
2. However, the article does not mention that the Prime Minister has stated that the police are traveling to Thailand.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary's claim that the Prime Minister has announced the travel of police investigators to Thailand, which is not supported by the article. The article does not include any statement or information from the Prime Minister regarding the travel of the police team to Thailand.
