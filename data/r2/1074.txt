Article:
Pars goalkeeper Sean Murdoch denied Jamie Adams in a first half of few chances before two quick fire goals put the visitors in control.
El Bakhtaoui raced on to a Ryan Wallace ball to score his first, before scoring a stunning 30-yard volley from Michael Paton's cross.
Craig Moore fired a late chance over for Ayr United, who remain third.

Summary:
ayr united scored two late goals to beat ayr united in the first round of the scottish challenge cup.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "Ayr United scored two late goals to beat Ayr United," which is inconsistent because a team cannot play against itself or score against itself in a competitive match. This is a clear error in the summary.

2. The article does not mention the Scottish Challenge Cup or the first round of any competition. It simply describes a match with no reference to the specific tournament or stage of the competition.

3. The article mentions that two quick-fire goals were scored by El Bakhtaoui for the visitors (not specified, but not Ayr United), not Ayr United. This contradicts the summary's claim that Ayr United scored two late goals.

4. The article mentions a late chance fired over by Craig Moore for Ayr United, suggesting that Ayr United did not score late in the game, which is inconsistent with the summary's claim.

5. The article does not indicate the final result of the match or that Ayr United won the game, as implied by the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the scoring team, the timing of the goals, the competition being played, and the outcome of the match.

HUMAN:
