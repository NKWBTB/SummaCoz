Summary:
newport gwent dragons will not be given a contract before the end of the season, says the rugby football league (foxall).

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the information provided in the article:

1. The subject of the contract: The article does not mention the Rugby Football League (RFL) at all. Instead, it discusses a takeover bid by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) for the Newport Gwent Dragons, a rugby team that shares Rodney Parade with Newport County AFC (referred to as "County" in the article).

2. The nature of the contract: The article talks about an existing lease contract that Newport County AFC has to use the ground at Rodney Parade until 2023, with primacy of fixtures if they remain in the Football League. There is no mention of a new contract being negotiated or given before the end of the season.

3. The statement by Foxall: The article quotes Foxall, presumably a representative of Newport County AFC, as saying, "Our view is quite clear - we've got a contract," referring to the existing lease. Foxall does not make any statements about the Newport Gwent Dragons not being given a contract.

4. The timing of the takeover vote: The article states that the WRU's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to a vote on Tuesday, 9 May. There is no mention of the end of the season in relation to this vote.

In summary, the article is focused on the potential impact of the WRU's takeover of the Newport Gwent Dragons on Newport County AFC's lease agreement and use of Rodney Parade. The summary inaccurately attributes a statement to Foxall regarding the Newport Gwent Dragons and a contract, which is not supported by the article's content.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that Newport Gwent Dragons will not be given a contract before the end of the season, as stated by the rugby football league (Foxall).
2. However, the article does not mention any statement from the rugby football league or its CEO (Foxall) regarding Newport Gwent Dragons or the issuance of a contract.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which attributes a statement to the rugby football league CEO without supporting evidence in the article. The article primarily discusses Newport County's lease and potential impact from the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover bid, but it does not reference the rugby football league CEO or the specific statement mentioned in the summary.
