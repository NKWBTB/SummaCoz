He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, a statement on his website said.It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date.Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement.The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years.The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments.Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt.His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London.He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society.

And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director."The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: "I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing.

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is evident when we compare the details provided in the article with the information presented in the summary. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The article does not mention a "British composer Michael Handel." Instead, it talks about Christopher Hogwood, who was a conductor and a key figure in the early-music movement.

2. The article does not provide any information about Christopher Hogwood's age at the time of his death. Therefore, the age "89" mentioned in the summary cannot be verified against the article.

3. The summary refers to the individual as a "composer," while the article primarily discusses Christopher Hogwood's contributions as a conductor, founder of the Academy of Ancient Music, and a musicologist. Although he may have had compositional experience, the article does not emphasize him as a composer, which is misleading in the context of the summary.

4. The summary does not capture the essence of the article, which is to pay tribute to Christopher Hogwood and his legacy in the field of music, particularly in historically informed performances and the early-music movement.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly names the individual as "Michael Handel," provides an unsubstantiated age, misrepresents his role as primarily a composer, and fails to accurately reflect the content and focus of the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that tributes have been paid to British composer Michael Handel, who has died at the age of 89.
2. However, the article states that Christopher Hogwood, the conductor and founder of the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM), has passed away. There is no mention of Michael Handel in the article, and the focus is on Christopher Hogwood's life and contributions to music.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly attributes the death and tributes to Michael Handel instead of Christopher Hogwood, the subject of the article.
