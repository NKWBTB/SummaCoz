Article:
The fight, Adams' second as a professional and first in her home city for 20 years, will be over four three-minute rounds, rather than the usual two-minute rounds for women.
The flyweight voiced her frustration with two-minute rounds after beating Virginia Carcamo last month.
Salazar, 18, has lost once in six professional contests.
Adams, 34, says the extra minute in each round will give her a chance to try out things she has learnt in the gym.
She said: "I had two minutes to find my rhythm, distance and take out my opponent. It's not enough time.
"I found, by the end of the rounds, I needed a couple more seconds and it would be over.
"Now we have three minutes, I'm able to relax more, establish the jab, find the rhythm properly and really get in the swing of things."
On the same card, WBC international featherweight champion Josh Warrington defends his title against Spain's Kiko Martinez.

GPT4:
1. The article does not mention Nicola Adams losing her WBO super-bantamweight title to Alberto Salazar. Instead, it discusses Adams' upcoming fight in her home city and her thoughts on the change from two-minute to three-minute rounds.

2. The article states that Adams' opponent, Salazar, has lost once in six professional contests, which implies that Salazar is not the reigning champion and that the fight is not for the WBO super-bantamweight title.

3. The article does not specify the outcome of the fight, as it seems to be discussing the event before it has taken place. Therefore, it cannot be claimed that Adams lost the fight in the first round, as the summary suggests.

4. The article mentions that the fight will be over four three-minute rounds, which contradicts the summary's claim that Adams lost in the first round. The summary's statement cannot be substantiated without information on the fight's result.

5. The summary introduces the name "Alberto Alberto Salazar," which is inconsistent with the article. The article only mentions "Salazar" without a first name, and there is no indication that the person's name is "Alberto Alberto."

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it presents an outcome of a fight that is not discussed in the article, misrepresents the status of the fighters, and introduces incorrect names.
