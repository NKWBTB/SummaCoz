Summary:

GPT4:
1. The article states that Roberto Mancini has made comments about Manuel Pellegrini, who is the current manager of Manchester City at the time of the article. Mancini is quoted as saying that Pellegrini should be winning a trophy every year given the strong team he inherited.

2. The summary incorrectly refers to Mancini turning up the heat for "Manuel Pellegrini's successor." This is inconsistent with the article because it implies that Pellegrini is no longer the manager and that Mancini is directing his comments towards the next person in line, which is not the case.

3. The article clearly indicates that Pellegrini is under pressure in his current role, not that he has been succeeded by someone else. Mancini's comments are directed at Pellegrini himself, not at a successor.

4. The article also mentions that Pellegrini won two trophies in the previous season and is currently facing challenges with Manchester City's performance, which further supports that Pellegrini is the current manager and not someone who has already been replaced.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly suggests that Manuel Pellegrini has been succeeded by another manager, while the article is actually discussing the pressure on Pellegrini in his current role as the manager of Manchester City.
