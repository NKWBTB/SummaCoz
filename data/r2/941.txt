GPT4:
1. The summary states that "the full back signed a three-year deal with Atletico Madrid in July." This is inconsistent with the article, which clearly states that Filipe Luis signed a three-year contract with Chelsea, not Atletico Madrid, when he moved from the Spanish champions last July.

2. The summary also mentions that "he is refusing to let his league leaders rest on their return until the job is done." This statement is misleading because it implies that Filipe Luis is the one refusing to let the league leaders rest. However, the article specifies that it is Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho who is refusing to let his league leaders rest on their laurels, not Filipe Luis.

3. The phrase "on their return" in the summary is vague and does not correlate with any specific information provided in the article. It could be misinterpreted as referring to Atletico Madrid or Chelsea, and it does not clarify what "return" means in this context.

In summary, the inconsistencies are found in the incorrect mention of the team Filipe Luis signed with and the misattribution of the statement about not letting the league leaders rest, which in the article is attributed to Jose Mourinho, not Filipe Luis.
