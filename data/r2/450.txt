Summary:
st mirren have signed striker jeremy clarkson on a season-long loan from dundee.

GPT4:
1. The article states that Clarkson joined St Mirren, but it does not mention that this move was on a season-long loan. Instead, it simply says he joined for a second spell, implying a permanent transfer or a different type of contract, not necessarily a loan.

2. The article mentions Clarkson's previous season at Dundee, where he scored nine goals, but it does not say that he has moved from Dundee to St Mirren on loan. The absence of the word "loan" suggests that the summary's claim about the nature of the transfer is inconsistent with the article.

3. The summary introduces the name "Jeremy Clarkson," which is not mentioned anywhere in the article. The article refers to the player simply as "Clarkson," without providing a first name, so the inclusion of "Jeremy" is inconsistent with the information provided.

4. The article provides details about Clarkson's readiness to play and his fitness, his past international experience, and his anticipation for upcoming games with St Mirren. However, it does not provide any details about the terms of his transfer, such as it being a season-long loan, which is a key claim in the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states the nature of Clarkson's transfer as a season-long loan and introduces a first name, "Jeremy," that is not found in the article.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that St Mirren has signed striker Jeremy Clarkson on a season-long loan from Dundee.
2. However, the article does not mention any transfer of Jeremy Clarkson to St Mirren. Instead, the article discusses a player named Clarkson (without specifying the first name) who joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship. The player in question appears to be a footballer, not the well-known TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary assumes Jeremy Clarkson, the TV presenter, has been signed by St Mirren, while the article discusses a different individual who is a footballer.
