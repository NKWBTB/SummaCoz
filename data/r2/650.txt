Summary:
national league side torquay united have signed striker myles anderson on a two-year contract after he was released by the national league club.

GPT4:
1. The article states that a player named Anderson has cancelled his contract with Barrow to join their National League rivals. However, it does not specify the first name of Anderson, nor does it mention that the player's first name is Myles.

2. The article does not mention the length of the contract that Anderson has signed with the new club. Therefore, the claim in the summary that Myles Anderson has signed a two-year contract is not supported by the information in the article.

3. The article does mention a player named Myles, but it refers to him as Myles Keating, not Myles Anderson. Keating is described as a striker, while Anderson is referred to as a centre-back. This indicates that the summary has incorrectly combined two separate individuals into one person.

4. The article does not state that Anderson was "released" by his former club; it says that he "cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent." This is a different situation than being released, as it implies a joint decision between the player and the club.

5. The summary incorrectly identifies the National League side as Torquay United for the signing of the player named Myles Anderson. The article does not specify which National League rivals Anderson has joined, only that he could feature against his old club on 18 February.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly merges details about two different players (Anderson and Keating), provides incorrect information about the length of the contract and the manner of Anderson's departure from his previous club, and inaccurately names the club involved in the signing.

2. However, the article states that Centre-back Anderson has canceled his Barrow contract by mutual consent and is joining their National League rivals. The article does not mention any signing of Myles Anderson by Torquay United on a two-year contract. Instead, it discusses the departure of Centre-back Anderson from Barrow.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies that Torquay United signed Myles Anderson after his release, whereas the article provides information about another player, Centre-back Anderson, who canceled his contract with Barrow.
