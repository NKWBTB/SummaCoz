Article:
Four burly Swedish cops put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty on a Manhattan subway train last night. The friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik Näslund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus Åsberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said. When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Misérables.

GPT4:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The summary states that Samuel Kvarzell is 26 years old, but the article states that he is 25 years old. This is a factual inconsistency regarding the age of one of the Swedish officers.

2. The summary mentions "Makrus Åsberg, 25, Samuel Kvarzell, 26, and Eric Jansberger, 28," but it omits the fourth officer, Erik Näslund, who was also involved in the incident. The article clearly states that there were four Swedish cops, and it provides the names and ages of all four individuals.

3. The summary says, "the train found the homeless man in the fight," which is a confusing and incorrect statement. It was not the train that found the homeless man; rather, the Swedish officers intervened in the fight between the homeless man and another rider after hearing the conductor's call for police assistance.

4. The summary does not mention that the Swedish officers were on a 6 train during rush hour when they intervened in the assault, which is an important detail provided in the article.

5. The summary does not accurately reflect the sequence of events or the actions taken by the Swedish officers as described in the article. It fails to mention that the officers subdued the attacker, held him until the NYPD arrived, and that one of them stayed with the victim.

6. The summary does not capture the quote from the article correctly. It states, "`we came here for vacation, just tourists,'" which is a fragmented and incomplete representation of the actual quote from Makrus Åsberg in the article: "We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists."

7. The summary does not mention that the officers were on their way to see "Les Misérables" when the incident occurred, which is a detail that sets the context for their presence on the subway.

Overall, the summary fails to accurately represent the details of the article, omitting key information and introducing inaccuracies regarding the individuals involved and the events that took place.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the Swedish cops, who were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway, put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a Manhattan subway train.
2. However, the article states that the Swedish cops, including Makrus Åsberg, Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell, and Eric Jansberger, were already on the subway train when they heard a frantic conductor asking if there were any police officers on the train. They then sprang into action to stop the assault. The summary incorrectly suggests that the assault occurred after the friends were on their way to see Les Misérables.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly implies the timing of the assault, suggesting it happened while the friends were on their way to see Les Misérables, while the article states that they were already on the subway train when they intervened.
