A hound's howl breaks through the cold rainfall. Dozens more hounds emerge from a stand of trees and bound across a field in search of a fox's scent. Horses carrying riders in red and black coats follow from a ways behind, quickly disappearing again over a hillcrest, minutes away from Baltimore's growing suburbs. The Elkridge-Harford Hunt Club has roots dating back to 1878, but records show organized foxhunts took place in Maryland as early as the 1790s. In order to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space in the midst of one of the world's densest regions, the club has managed to protect a patchwork of land that is larger than Manhattan. According to the website of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, there are nearly 160 organized foxhunting clubs in the U.S. and Canada. And while the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns 10 years ago is still debated, the American hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill a fox. In many places red foxes are a rarity in the US so the hounds chase coyotes - a distant cousin of the fox - instead. But from dress to decorum, many of the traditions remain unaltered from its inception.

GPT4:
1. The summary states that "the Elkridge-Harford Hunt Club have roots dating back to 1878." This is consistent with the article, which mentions the same founding year for the club.

2. The summary also mentions that "the club has managed to protect the land that is larger than Manhattan." This is consistent with the article, which states that the club has protected a patchwork of land larger than Manhattan to preserve their pastime.

3. The summary correctly notes that "there are nearly 160 organized foxhunting clubs in the U.S. and Canada," which is supported by the article's reference to the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America's website.

4. The summary claims that "the American hunt is a ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns." This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article mentions that the sport's ban in Britain is still debated, but it does not say that the American hunt is banned. Instead, it implies that the American version of the hunt is different, focusing on the chase rather than the kill, which is not a ban.

5. Lastly, the summary mentions "horses carrying riders in red and black coats follow from ways behind." This is consistent with the article's description of the scene during a fox hunt, where horses and riders follow the hounds.

The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement about the American hunt being banned in Britain due to animal welfare concerns. The article does not state that the American hunt is banned; it only discusses the ban of foxhunting in Britain and how the American hunt differs in its approach to the chase.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that the American hunt is a ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns, but the article states that the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns 10 years ago is still debated. This implies that the ban is not a permanent one and that the sport is still being debated.
