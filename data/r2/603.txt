Summary:

GPT4:
1. The article does not mention that the abuse took place in a "Dundee flat." It only states that the trial took place at Dundee Sheriff Court. The location of the abuse is not specified in the provided text.

2. The term "sexually abusing" is not used in the article. Instead, the article states that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with another man. While this could be considered a form of sexual abuse, the summary's wording does not accurately reflect the specific charges mentioned in the article.

3. The article does not explicitly state that the man (Clive Weatherhogg) has been jailed. It mentions that he was placed on the sex offenders register and that the case was remitted to the High Court for sentencing due to its greater sentencing powers, but it does not provide information about the actual sentence he received.

4. The summary omits significant details from the article, such as Weatherhogg setting up meetings through an adult website, filming the encounters, and sending explicit clips to the victim's sister and father. These details are important to understand the full scope of Weatherhogg's actions and the charges against him.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately suggests the location of the abuse, uses a term not present in the article to describe the crime, does not confirm that Weatherhogg has been jailed, and omits key details of the case.

HUMAN:
1. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat.
2. However, the article does not mention that the man was specifically convicted of "sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat." The article provides details about Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister. While the article describes sexual misconduct and harassment, it does not specify that it occurred in a Dundee flat or use the term "sexually abusing."
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary simplifies the charges and circumstances, which are more complex in the article, and uses different terminology that is not directly supported by the article.
