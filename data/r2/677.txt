GPT4:
The summary states that "police in the republic of ireland are searching for a man who has been missing for more than 20 years." This statement is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The article does not mention that the police are currently searching for the missing man, Trevor Deely. Instead, it discusses a specific search of a site in Chapelizod in Dublin, which started on a Saturday morning.

2. The article focuses on the details of the search, including the location, the involvement of excavations, and the expected duration of the search. It also mentions a review of Mr. Deely's disappearance and the enhancement of CCTV footage.

3. The article talks about the police's interest in a man dressed in black who was seen talking to Mr. Deely on the night of his disappearance and who was later seen following him. The police have appealed for this man to come forward.

4. The summary's reference to "searching for a man" could be interpreted as looking for Mr. Deely himself, whereas the article is actually describing a search of a specific area related to his disappearance and an appeal for information about an unidentified man seen in the CCTV footage.

5. The article does not state that the search for Mr. Deely is ongoing beyond the specific search mentioned. The summary's use of the present continuous tense ("are searching") implies an active, ongoing search for Mr. Deely himself, which is not supported by the details in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately suggests that the police are actively searching for the missing man himself, rather than conducting a search of a specific site and seeking information about an unidentified individual seen in connection with Mr. Deely's disappearance.

HUMAN:
1. The summary implies that the article is about police in the Republic of Ireland searching for a man who has been missing for more than 20 years.
2. However, the article is about the search for Trevor Deely, a specific individual who went missing in December 2000. The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, including the area being searched, the involvement of the police (Gardaí), and the efforts to identify a man seen in CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests a more general search for a missing person in the Republic of Ireland, while the article is specific to the case of Trevor Deely.
