Summary:
st mirren have signed st mirren midfielder jack clarkson on loan until the end of the season, with the option of a further 12 months.

GPT4:
1. The article mentions that Clarkson has joined St Mirren, but it does not specify that the move is a loan deal. The summary incorrectly states that "St Mirren have signed St Mirren midfielder Jack Clarkson on loan."

2. The article does not mention any "option of a further 12 months." The summary introduces this detail without any support from the article.

3. The article refers to Clarkson as a player who could make his debut for St Mirren, implying he is a new addition to the team. The summary incorrectly refers to him as "St Mirren midfielder Jack Clarkson," which suggests he was already a part of the team before this move.

4. The article does not mention the player's name as "Jack Clarkson." It simply refers to him as "Clarkson," so the inclusion of the first name "Jack" in the summary is not supported by the article.

5. The article provides background information on Clarkson's career, including his previous teams and his performance, but it does not mention anything about the terms of his contract or the duration of his stay with St Mirren, which contradicts the specifics given in the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it introduces details about a loan deal and an option for an additional year that are not present in the article, incorrectly names the player, and incorrectly suggests that Clarkson was already a St Mirren player before this move.
