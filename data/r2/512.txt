Summary:

GPT4:
The inconsistency in the summary is the mention of the "Republic of Ireland." The article does not mention the Republic of Ireland at all; instead, it discusses James Milner's career with the England national team. Here are the steps that identify the inconsistency:

1. The article states that James Milner is a former Manchester City player who has won 61 caps for England, indicating his international career was with the England national team.

2. The article mentions Milner's participation in World Cups and European Championships, which are competitions he would have played in as a member of the England squad, not the Republic of Ireland.

3. The quote from Milner in the article references Sam Allardyce, who is associated with English football, further confirming Milner's connection to England.

4. Milner's record as the most capped England Under-21 player and his goal in the 2014 Fifa World Cup qualifiers for England are additional details that confirm his international career was with England.

5. The summary's claim that Milner announced his retirement from international football with the Republic of Ireland is inconsistent with the entire content of the article, which clearly associates Milner with the England national team throughout his international career.

Therefore, the summary is incorrect because it incorrectly associates James Milner with the Republic of Ireland when, in fact, his international football career was with England.
