Centrelink's service, Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service that helps to manage welfare funds . Of that $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems and other home theatre devices.

A report released by finance company Credit Suisse has expressed that any change in the rules that regulate the consumer leasing industry would have a huge effect on Radio Rentals and their business. Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service offered by Centrelink and deducts welfare payments in manageable amounts in order to pay nominated bills. Those bills can be toward rent, electricity, gas, water, ambulance or medical services and many more.

Five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City and it could prove more tense and exciting than the Barclays Premier League title race itself. Adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join Europe\u2019s elite next season must swallow an estimated \u00a330million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish . Louis van Gaal said that he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total . \u2018The best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can,\u2019 said Arsenal manager Wenger. \u2018You can see the quality of the teams behind us. Seventy-two points might be enough. \u2018People have finished in the top four with 67 points, but if you look at this year, we have 51 points, so it will be in the 70s. It is a tough run-in, similar to last year.\u2019 Arsenal finished fourth last year with 79 points, well clear of Everton in fifth with 72. It is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years. When Everton came fourth in 2005, they had 61 points ahead of Liverpool in fifth with 58. In each of the past two years, however, the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points. Van Gaal acknowledged Wenger\u2019s years of expertise in the area. \u2018I want to believe him,\u2019 said the Manchester United boss. \u2018It is a rat race. It is going into the last week.\u2019 Arsenal have not given up hope of catching City to finish second, but there is a nine-point gap to Chelsea who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top. Wenger said: \u2018We are nowhere near close to being in the title race. We are too far from Chelsea to say that we are in the title race, but you never know what can happen. \u2018Why should Manchester City give up for the title? They did it before from eight points behind. Without speculating on the weaknesses of any team, we want to be consistent and do as well as we can.\u2019 World Cup winner Mesut Ozil has been in impressive form for Arsenal since returning from injury . ARSENAL . Suffered a Euro wobble but form is strong in the Premier League, winning six of seven since defeat at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day, after which Wenger switched goalkeepers. Attention is spread over three competitions, although maybe not for long.\u00a0They trail Monaco 1-3 in the Champions League and go to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They are awash with goals, have key players fit and options to make changes, especially up front. Also experienced top-four finishers, with an eye still on catching Manchester City. Top 7 games to play: 3. Prediction: 76pts. Wayne Rooney has returned to an attacking role since Robin van Persie's injury and has performed well there . MANCHESTER UNITED . Results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of Robin van Persie\u2019s injury has moved Wayne Rooney back up front which may prove serendipitous. But they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures, with five of the top seven to play and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle. Away form is poor, with 16 points on the road this season \u2014 the worst in top half barring West Ham. Fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals, but more likely a problem with form so sluggish. Should at least be fresh, having only played 32 games in all competitions. Top 7 games: 5. Prediction: 71pts. Liverpool have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat Manchester City . LIVERPOOL . Finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start. Helped by a settled system, the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Steven Gerrard. They boast the best form in the Premier League since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past. They also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more Europe, but finish with awkward away games at Chelsea and Stoke. No sign of fatigue but Burnley is their 45th game of the season. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 73pts. Morgan Schneiderlin has impressed for Southampton this season as the Saints surprised everyone . SOUTHAMPTON . Scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager Ronald Koeman since the end of January, as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing Champions League qualification and are plotting to stop them. Perhaps this, together with increased expectations, is catching up with them after a brilliant start. Injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which cannot boast the same depth as others pursuing the Champions League. The dream faded during February, a month when Saints scored once in five games, but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 61pts. Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, scoring 24 goals so far in all competitions . TOTTENHAM . In a mini-slump after five without a win in all competitions and bruised by a Europa League exit and Wembley defeat inside three days. Can they be revived and refocused after a gruelling season of 45 games to date? There are 12 more to go, including seven tricky away fixtures. It is a character test for a young team which has key players such as Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Eric Dier completing their first full Premier League campaign.

Taylor's influence is now mind blowing - she has\u00a052.8 million Twitter followers and\u00a074.4 million likes on Facebook. Last year, Shake It Off went to No.1 on the iTunes chart in 64 different countries and in January, she sold the four millionth copy of 1989 in the US alone. The new success had coincided with a new Taylor - one who had cut off her long blonde hair into a sophisticated bob, moved to New York and developed a close-knit group of female friends who she frequently hosts dinner parties for at her Tribeca apartment. Perhaps most crucially though, 2014 also marked the year that Taylor Swift was a singleton. Taylor with with the supermodel Cara Delevingne . Taylor with the singer Lorde (left) and Ellie Goulding (right) Since she was 16, Taylor has had a slew of celebrity boyfriends that have all ended in heartbreak. It would be hard not to be aware of her failed romances, given the coverage they have received both in her music and in the news. In her teens, she dated heartthrobs Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas, before moving on to the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer. There was a brief romance with Conor Kennedy before what has now become her most famous relationship - Harry Styles. Taylor Swift with ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas, who she dated in 2008 . Taylor Swift with Taylor Lautner, who she dated in 2009 . But her dalliance with the One Direction star was enough to put Taylor off men and since her break-up with the singer in January 2013, she has focused on living a single life. She told The Telegraph on Saturday: 'The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship - I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are.' 'I used to think it was important to find a boyfriend, but I don't feel that it is now.' In doing this, the tide has turned for Taylor in terms of public opinion - up until last year, many derided the star for being boy crazy and acting like a crazed bunny boiler. The reputation for being a man hunter also unfairly affected people's opinions about her professional success, which has been almost unprecedented for a singer/songwriter of her age. Taylor with Jake Gyllenhaal (left), who she dated in 2010 and Conor Kennedy, who she dated in 2012 . Taylor with Harry Styles in December 2012 in New York . But with 1989, a new Taylor emerged - the songs were no longer about men and more about her relationships with her peers and the public. Shake It Off was a brilliant two fingers up to the 'haters' who had been criticising her for so long simply for having boyfriends. Taylor's move to New York from Nashville also coincided with a chic new style. For the last 12 months, the star has consistently been photographed on the world's best dressed lists and she even holds her own when out partying with her gaggle of supermodel friends like Karlie Kloss. From left: Cara Delevingne,\u00a0Natalia Vodianova,\u00a0Karlie Kloss and Taylor . Taylor with Lena Dunham in New York last December . Every morning, she leaves her Manhattan loft dressed in an immaculate ensemble that puts most celebrities to shame. Stick her name into Google and it is virtually impossible to find a snap of Taylor with a hair out of place.

Taylor with Karlie at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in London last December . Ellie Goulding and Lewis Hamilton present Taylor Swift with the award for International Female at last month's BRIT Awards . Her feelings of responsibility towards her fans is one of the strongest in showbiz - she researches their hobbies on social media and then buys presents for them that reflect their personalities. According to the Telegraph, she has even been known to help pay off her supporters' student loans. She said: 'Do they like photography? I'll get them an 1980s Polaroid camera. Do they like vintage stuff? I'll go to an antiques place and get them 1920s earrings. Do they work out a lot? I'll get them workout stuff. 'When you actually get to know them on a person-by-person basis, you realise what you're doing is special and sacred and it matters.'

Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. \"We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours,\" said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. \"We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need.\" Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. \"He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife.\" \"I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing.\" Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. \"It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves,\" Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. \"Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society.\" Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to \"reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial.\" The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant \"that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\"\u200b .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nshafqat hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged thursday.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Exit polls showed Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists. This meant a loss of 30 of the regional councils for Francois Hollande's party, which came to power nationally in 2012. Scroll down for video . France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure' Even the Correze department - Mr Hollande's home turf in the south west - was won by the UMP. Former president Mr Sarkozy said: 'Tonight, the Republican right, and the centre, has won the departmental elections.' Referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments.' Mr Sarkozy said 'three years' under the most outdated Socialist party in Europe had brought the country to its knees, and the electorate had had enough. Exit polls showed the opposition UMP party under Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured) controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists . 'A new era is starting. Hope is reborn for France,' said Mr Sarkozy. 'The road will be long and hard, but change is coming and nothing can stop it.' Also highlighting the 'failure' of the Socialists, was the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen. Although the FN was expected to win up to one department maximum, they were on course to win more than 200 seats on regional councils. Calling on Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, 'to resign', Ms Le Pen said her anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had a huge part to play in the future of France. Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, conceded 'incontestable' electoral defeat soon after the polls closed at 8pm. Far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen (pictured) also highlighted the 'failure' of the Socialists . Noting increased extremism in his country, Mr Valls said: 'Far-right gains in local elections are a sign of lasting change in the French political system'. The election will choose 4,108 local councillors and - crucially - shape the political landscape in the run-up to the 2017 presidential race. The vote was also a key test for Mr Sarkozy who, despite a series of corruption scandals, is convinced he can return to power in two years' time. According to the exit polls, the UMP and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as President Hollande's Socialists..

Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena.

Jihadi John, who was recently unmasked as 26-year-old Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was last seen in a video posted online which appeared to show Japanese hostage Kenji Goto lying dead. Saleh, who worked as a translator, also revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die. ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi who is known as Jihadi John (seen, left, with Japanese hostage Kenji Goto) was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives, claims a defector known as Saleh (right) Face of a killer:\u00a0Saleh, who worked as a translator, revealed that Emwazi (above) routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die . Speaking to told Sky News in broken English from Turkey after fleeing ISIS, Saleh said: 'When he killed Kenji Goto, I live showed this (saw this) but not near, from a little (distance). 'The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say \"put this camera there, change place there\" but John (was) the big boss. 'All time, all time say to all \"fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish\". So respect him. Only he talks orders - others do.' Saleh said the prisoners would be given Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured that they would not be killed. He said: 'He would say to me \"say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. \"We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors\".' Saleh said he explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed. His comments explain why so many of the prisoners appear so calm in the executions videos right up to the point where the knife is placed against their throat. A still photo of  Kenji Goto holding a picture of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh. ISIS defector Saleh revealed how hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends . After Mr Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. Appearing with his face covered, the man added Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. He said: 'Maybe because he use the knife. I cannot understand why he is so strong. 'One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in ISIS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John.' And hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, with their captors telling them they would not be killed as it was a show for the camera, according to Saleh. Murderer: Jihadi John seen (in black mask) leading the execution of a dozen prisoners. Emwazi was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to defector Saleh . Kuwait-born Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities, but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. In e-mail exchanges with a journalist, the University of Westminster computer programming graduate said he considered suicide after coming face to face with what he suspected to be a British spy as he attempted to sell a laptop computer in 2010. Jihadi John rose to notoriety after he first appeared in a video posted online last August, in which he appeared to kill American journalist James Foley. Dressed in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose, and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

Broner, a former three weight world champion, won a unanimous points decision over John Molina on Saturday as he continued to rebuild his reputation after losing his undefeated record two years ago to Marcos Maidana \u2013 who then twice fought and lost to Mayweather. So comfortable was the Molina fight for Broner that on Tuesday he said he would be ready to face Khan 'at the end of this month'. Writing on Instagram, Broner said: 'No disrespect to Virgil Hunter he is a great coach and I got endless love for him but me and Amir Khan can fight at the end of this month I haven't taken any punishment I'm back in the gym and ready to make a fool out of anybody #AboutBillions #ABonNBC' Khan appeared to laugh off Broner's claims on Twitter before going on to tweet: 'Would love to fight @AdrienBroner next! #KhanvsBroner lets make it happen.' Broner won a unanimous points decision on Saturday but says he copped little punishment and is in the gym . On Monday, Broner even suggested he would be prepared to come to England to fight Khan. 'I can't wait. I'd even fight him at Wembley,' Broner told BoxingNews24. Last year Mayweather hit back at Khan's claims he was running scared and told him to prove his credentials by beating Broner on the undercard of his first fight with Maidana. Floyd Mayweather hit back at Khan's claims he was running scared but chose to fight Manny Pacquaio . Mayweather tweeted: 'I don't have an easy fight on May 3, 2014, so I can't overlook @ChinoMaidana but @AmirKingKhan, if you and @AdrienBroner end up fighting each other on my show and you win (which you won't) ...

The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. \"What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,\" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. \"I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,\" Richel said. \"I didn't hear him say anything,\" she said. \"Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today.\" She said the man came \"within inches\" of whacking her with the machete. \"This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,\" Richel said. \"And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible.\" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. \"Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" she said. \"I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him.\" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. \"What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,\" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. \"The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span ... of this event,\" Normand said. \"Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else.\" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said \"there is a mental illness component\" in their investigation of the suspect. \"No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,\" Normand said. \"And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior.\" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport. Contrary to earlier reports, Normand said Saturday, White was no longer a taxi driver. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport was with a machete and a car containing smoke bombs.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Mancini thinks Pellegrini was 'really lucky' to inherit a strong side from him and he should be delivering continual success at the Etihad Stadium. But Pellegrini, who did win two trophies last season, is now under heavy pressure with City faltering in their Barclays Premier League title defence and facing an uphill task against Barcelona in the Champions League. Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure to save Manchester City's season and his job as well . Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defence and Champions League campaign . Manchester City will look to overturn a 201 first-leg deficit against Barcelona in their Champions League tie . Mancini, who was sacked by City in 2013 despite winning the Premier League title the previous year, told CNN: 'I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players. 'I think City can win a title every year and have a chance - it should and must try to win a title every year.' Mancini's jibe came on the eve of the second leg of City's last-16 Champions League tie at Barcelona, which they will go into trailing 2-1. Roberto Mancini guided Manchester City to the Premier League title in 2012 after FA Cup success in 2011 . Mancini lost his job at City in 2013 after his team's failed title defence and poor European showing . The success or otherwise of City's season now appears to hinge on the outcome at the Nou Camp as, trailing Chelsea by six points having played a game more, the Premier League looks beyond them. But Mancini said: 'It's my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League. It's in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it's the best team.

After months of negotiation, the Government failed to secure the crucial agreement to protect customers, as bank bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking. The High street banks have agreed to new industry-wide rules setting out a series of steps they must take before closing branches. Blame it on the internet: As they refuse to commit to never closing 'the last bank in town', bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking . But critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country \u2013 even when there is no other bank in the community. Under the new regime banks will have to consult with local communities before any branch closure and ensure there are alternatives for customers such as free cash machines, \u2018mobile banking vans\u2019, and a local Post Office where they can sort out their finances. Existing rules stipulate that they have to go through this process only if they are closing the last branch in a town or village. Banks also have to give 12 weeks\u2019 notice before they shut a branch. Business secretary Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019. But last night Labour described the rules as another \u2018nail in the coffin for the High street\u2019, as all the major lenders have now ditched a previous commitment always to keep open the \u2018last bank in town\u2019. Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019 Lloyds became the last to do so in October, as it announced a three year plan to shut 200 branches and open 50. Efforts by Mr Cable to force banks to reinstate this commitment have been rejected and experts have warned that 978 branches around the country are now at risk. In total more than 500 branches are expected to be shut during the course of the year, with 210 closures announced so far. Of these 124 are the last branch in the community. For example, some 8,000 residents of Keynworth in Nottinghamshire have been left without a bank after the closure of their local NatWest branch earlier this year. and St Agnes in Cornwall has also lost its only branch after Barclays put down the shutters for the final time. There are now just over 9000 bank branches across the country, half the number of 25 years ago. Derek French from the Campaign for Community Banking said efforts by the coalition to beef up protection for consumers have failed. He said: . \u2018The government is trying to gloss over the fact that in reality it has achieved nothing and will not prevent hundreds of branches from disappearing from Britain\u2019s high streets. This is hugely damaging for local communities. The hardest hit will be small businesses, the elderly and the vulnerable \u2013 who rely heavily on their local bank\u2019. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: \u2018This is a massive embarrassment for Vince Cable. Local communities sometimes rely on the basic services of a branch and this feels very much like another bail in the coffin for the High Street.\u2019 The bosses of all the major banks have justified the closure of branches by stressing the soaring popularity of digital banking \u2013 both online and on smart phones. They have also argued it is not viable to keep certain branches open because so few customers use them. Royal Bank of Scotland boss Ross McEwan last year described its busiest branch as the 7.01am train from Reading to London Paddington, with over 167,000 using its mobile banking app between 7am and 8am on their commute to work every day. The British Bankers\u2019 Association says internet and mobile banking is now used for transactions worth \u00a36.4 billion a week \u2013 up from \u00a35.8 billion last year. But according to charity Age UK, more than a third of older people have mobility problems making travelling long distances to their nearest branch difficult. Almost 15pc have limited dexterity which means it is hard to use the internet while 4.8 million people aged 65 and over have never been online. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK said: \u2018Accessing cash and paying bills are essential services which must be easily available to everyone. But the combination of bank and building society closures, particularly in rural areas, and the industry\u2019s growing reliance on online services mean access has become increasingly difficult for many older people.\u2019 Vince Cable has said that the Post Office can play a vital role in providing an alternative for bank customers. Most banks already offer basic services via the Post Office\u2019s 11,500 branches.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ncritics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The Toffees were the country's last hope on the continent before a 5-2 loss to Dynamo Kiev in Europe on Thursday night meant they followed Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City in crashing out at the last 16 stage. It meant that there were no English teams in Friday's draw for either the Champions League or Europa League quarter-finals for the first time since 1995, sparking a countrywide debate about the state of the domestic game. Everton boss Roberto Martinez has highlighted an extensive fixture list behind their Europa League exit . However, Martinez believes it is the competitive nature of the Premier League, coupled with a lack of a winter break, which is hampering clubs when they face fresher, less-tested teams in European competitions. 'I think there are aspects there that make it very, very difficult for an English club to have success in Europe,' the Spaniard said. 'If you look at the top leagues in Europe most of those have got a little break in the winter. I'm not saying that's the difference but it can make a big difference in a squad that is playing domestically two cup competitions, when others are playing one cup competition. Everton's Phil Jagielka, Tim Howard and Leighton Baines look dejected after Dynamo Kiev ran riot . Everton's Ross Barkley and James McCarthy (right) look miserable during the painful defeat on Thursday . 'We need to understand that our league is the best in world football. And when I say the best it's because if you are at 70 per cent in a game, you're going to lose it. That's how competitive it is. It doesn't matter about position in the table and I don't think the other leagues have that. 'The top teams that are normally involved in Europe can cruise through games and that makes it a lot easier to plan a group of fixtures in a two-to-three-week period. That is a big difference and that affects English clubs. 'It's not by coincidence. Some of the clubs in the Champions League have been unfortunate, there have been small margins but those small margins could easily be the demands that you face domestically. It's something that clearly hasn't been working in our favour.' Roberto Martinez and substitute Leon Osman\u00a0remonstrate with the fourth official Christoph Bornhorst . Martinez's men were ruthlessly eliminated in Kiev by a display of clinical attacking finishing as the hosts exposed their visitors' defensive frailties. But while the manner of their exit was disappointing to Martinez, he took plenty of heart from a campaign which saw them beat Wolfsburg home and away and take four points off Lille in the group stage. 'It's started a real thirst to be in that environment again,' Martinez added. The scoreboard tells its own story as Everton were outclassed by\u00a0Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine . 'For our younger players, it is the first time they've been in Europe and the way we succeeded in many of those games, going away into different countries and being able to perform has been very important. 'I do feel that the players in the squad, myself, my staff and the football club as a whole will want more of it. It gives you a real desire to push ourselves to become a winning team and have that more often. 'We're all disappointed from the result last night but to reach the quarter-finals of this competition is something we last did 30 years ago, that shows you the size of the achievement.'

Five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City and it could prove more tense and exciting than the Barclays Premier League title race itself. Adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join Europe\u2019s elite next season must swallow an estimated \u00a330million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish . Louis van Gaal said that he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total . \u2018The best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can,\u2019 said Arsenal manager Wenger. \u2018You can see the quality of the teams behind us. Seventy-two points might be enough. \u2018People have finished in the top four with 67 points, but if you look at this year, we have 51 points, so it will be in the 70s. It is a tough run-in, similar to last year.\u2019 Arsenal finished fourth last year with 79 points, well clear of Everton in fifth with 72. It is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years. When Everton came fourth in 2005, they had 61 points ahead of Liverpool in fifth with 58. In each of the past two years, however, the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points. Van Gaal acknowledged Wenger\u2019s years of expertise in the area. \u2018I want to believe him,\u2019 said the Manchester United boss. \u2018It is a rat race. It is going into the last week.\u2019 Arsenal have not given up hope of catching City to finish second, but there is a nine-point gap to Chelsea who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top. Wenger said: \u2018We are nowhere near close to being in the title race. We are too far from Chelsea to say that we are in the title race, but you never know what can happen. \u2018Why should Manchester City give up for the title?

ARSENAL . Suffered a Euro wobble but form is strong in the Premier League, winning six of seven since defeat at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day, after which Wenger switched goalkeepers. Attention is spread over three competitions, although maybe not for long.\u00a0They trail Monaco 1-3 in the Champions League and go to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They are awash with goals, have key players fit and options to make changes, especially up front. Also experienced top-four finishers, with an eye still on catching Manchester City. Top 7 games to play: 3. Prediction: 76pts. Wayne Rooney has returned to an attacking role since Robin van Persie's injury and has performed well there . MANCHESTER UNITED . Results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of Robin van Persie\u2019s injury has moved Wayne Rooney back up front which may prove serendipitous. But they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures, with five of the top seven to play and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle. Away form is poor, with 16 points on the road this season \u2014 the worst in top half barring West Ham. Fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals, but more likely a problem with form so sluggish. Should at least be fresh, having only played 32 games in all competitions. Top 7 games: 5. Prediction: 71pts. Liverpool have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat Manchester City . LIVERPOOL . Finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start. Helped by a settled system, the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Steven Gerrard. They boast the best form in the Premier League since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past. They also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more Europe, but finish with awkward away games at Chelsea and Stoke. No sign of fatigue but Burnley is their 45th game of the season. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 73pts. Morgan Schneiderlin has impressed for Southampton this season as the Saints surprised everyone . SOUTHAMPTON . Scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager Ronald Koeman since the end of January, as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing Champions League qualification and are plotting to stop them. Perhaps this, together with increased expectations, is catching up with them after a brilliant start. Injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which cannot boast the same depth as others pursuing the Champions League. The dream faded during February, a month when Saints scored once in five games, but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 61pts. Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, scoring 24 goals so far in all competitions . TOTTENHAM . In a mini-slump after five without a win in all competitions and bruised by a Europa League exit and Wembley defeat inside three days.

It is a character test for a young team which has key players such as Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Eric Dier completing their first full Premier League campaign.

The west side of Lewis is the best place in the country to view the event, and Stornoway Astronomical Society has already received nearly 500 enquiries from people across Britain and Europe wanting to visit the islands for the eclipse. Eclipse viewing glasses have been selling out fast - and guest houses and B&Bs are opening up seasonally early to cope with the tourist demand. Scroll down for video . Visitors to the Isle of Lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse . Friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind 16 years and the best place to witness it is set to be in the Isle of Lewis . The tiny and remote hamlet of Aird Uig on the isle's west coast has been named as the best place in the UK to experience the deepest part of the solar eclipse - and shadow fever is starting to grip the area. Seacroft is Aird Uig's only B&B. Proprietor Sarah Taylor-Gerloch had sold both her spare rooms - but one, costing \u00a375-a-night, was to a couple of Dutch eclipse chasers. 'They have had to unfortunately cancel. He wanted to treat his wife to a surprise 50th birthday experience to watch the eclipse but it turned out there was a clash of birthday surprises. So the room is free,' said Mrs Taylor-Gerloch. Aird Uig is set to be the best place for viewing Friday's solar eclipse - and there are still rooms to rent . The village of Aird Uig has only one B&B, and one couple's cancellation has freed up a room for the eclipse . The Isle of Lewis is als famous for the Callanish prehistoric stone circle whis is said to be over 5000 years old . 'Ironically the other people who have booked did not know about the eclipse until I told them. They were coming for an outdoor break so this is a real bonus for them. 'We have a glorious view all the way to the Butt of Lewis but the eclipse has helped put Aird Uig on the map. It will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists. But it is a long way to come on the off chance. Aird Uig is a village on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Aird Uig is within the parish of Uig. Known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape. Aird Uig is mainly a former Cold War camp, high above sea level, used by the RAF to man a vital communications post. The giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting Aird Uig listed as an official dark skies spot. Richard Leparoux, who runs the small four star hotel Auberge at Carnish in Uig, said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from England - paying \u00a3135-a-night. 'I think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse,' he said. Pupils at Uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons. 'Many of our members have opened up in March especially for the eclipse,' he said. 'We have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok. Cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse. We are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost. 'People coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like Cornwall where people just hopped in a car. 'We have the best view in the UK and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them.' A spokesman for the Western Isles Council added: 'It is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not, in this case.' Aird Uig is a vital communications post, but residents want a community buyout of the military land . The moon will travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth and darkening the skies across Scotland and across Europe in the morning of Friday (20 March). It is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight. The partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will start around 8.30am and will last until about 10.45am. The further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland\u00a0is the place to be on this list . Dr Steve Bell, head of the HM Nautical Almanac Office said: 'The path of totality lies well to the northwest of the UK making landfall over the Faroe Islands and Svalbard as totality moves towards the North Pole. 'The UK will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse. 'The place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the UK is the west coast of the Isle of Lewis close to Aird Uig. 'Here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am. 'Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands.' Stornoway Astronomical Society are staging a special observing session at the 5,000 year old Callanish Stones - thought to have been an ancient observatory. Society president Donny Mackay said it had received a deluge of inquiries about the eclipse and were expecting a large number of visitors. 'The Isle of Lewis is the best location in the UK for viewing the eclipse - marginally better than in Shetland and the Orkney isles. We are hoping the weather will be in our favour on the day,' he said. A team from BBC Breakfast will be broadcasting live from Callanish too. David Warrington, resident astronomer at the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory added: 'It will suddenly get dark for half an hour or so with an eerie false dawn. 'From the Borders upwards you should get this noticeable darkening and the further north you travel the darker it will appear to be as more of the sun will disappear behind the moon.' Birds can be fooled by the sudden darkness and are likely to fly off to find refuge. Experts warned people not to look at the sun for too long and use eclipse glasses or a pinhole viewer.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nvisitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on friday.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest. 'We know what's going on up there, but we can't do anything about it. Nobody can help.' The club website advertises the first Wednesday of every month as 'greedy girl day' beginning at midday . The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave. Mrs Jewell added: 'We've made a couple of complaints, but there's no law for sexual activities. It's two years now just wasted.' According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm. The two businesses share a landlord, Frank Patterson, who said he has asked No 3 Club to take steps improve the situation. Mr Patterson said: 'The No 3 Club came into the unit five years ago, Cheryl and Matthew have been there two years. There were two other tenants before them and it wasn't a problem. 'Now the No 3 Club has extended its hours into the working day. 'I've heard the noises and it's not acceptable. I've spoken to the No 3 Club about it on numerous occasions on behalf of Cheryl and Matthew and they've made no effort to improve the situation. If anything it's got worse.' He added: 'I've written to the No 3 Club and, if and when they renew their lease, I've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day.' Councillor Paul Walmsley, from Chorley Council, said: 'The council has received a complaint about the No.3 Club, but as both parties are commercial premises, we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings.

Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill. To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds. Scroll down for video . A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail.\u00a0Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket . The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes. This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed. Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, R\u00e9union and Mauritius. Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. Lifespan: Two to five years . Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth. The tongue\u2019s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself. In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion. The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved. Previous studies didn\u2019t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said. When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics.

'Although it\u2019s open to all, each day they take students off for morning prayers and my daughter would not be doing that, and she would, therefore, be taken out and isolated. I\u2019m not sure she would be able to cope with that.\u2019 St Giles Church in Stoke Poges. Khalsa Secondary Academy opened in the village in September . Khalsa Secondary Academy opened with 180 pupils, and aims to build up to 850. The school intends to cater for students from all backgrounds, with \u201850 per cent of places prioritised for non-Sikh students\u2019. Plans to open the school were put forward by Slough Sikh Education Trust in 2013. Khalsa Primary School was already open in Slough, which is just across the border in Berkshire and has a large Sikh population. But the trust said there was no suitable site for the new school in Slough. There was a legal battle over the plans to open the school after people in Stoke Poges protested, saying they were worried about extra traffic and the \u2018urbanisation\u2019 of their village. A Buckinghamshire County Council spokesman said: \u2018Where we can\u2019t meet any of a parent\u2019s preferences, then the nearest school is allocated. \u2018In Mrs Jarvis\u2019s case, Khalsa Academy is the nearest school at 1.771 miles away, although Burnham Park E-Act Academy is the catchment school where there are still places. 'The advice to parents is \u2013 accept the place at this point and then appeal for preferred schools.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nshe said freya's friends have been allocated places at a school in beaconsfield.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

ENGLAND . Why they can win it . I\u2019m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in. George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France. Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster\u2019s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance. Bath fly half George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline this season . England and Wasps flanker James Haskell runs with the ball during training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Stuart Lancaster has been in charge of England for four seasons but has yet to secure a Six Nations title . They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven\u2019t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It\u2019s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there\u2019s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster\u2019s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 \u2014 and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity \u2014 but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi\u2019s absence hasn\u2019t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach\u2019s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster \u2014 compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O\u2019Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe\u2019s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don\u2019t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O\u2019Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach\u2019s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent\u2019s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He\u2019s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach\u2019s strengths? Warren Gatland\u2019s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him \u2014 the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I\u2019d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ndespite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Footage to be screened this evening on BBC1 focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows. When they are large enough the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to warehouses in large trays where they are then distributed to branches nationwide. The farmer in charge claimed the birds had 'a very good life' and showed how they were healthy . Farms supply KFC with around 23 million chickens each year and its chains sell almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. At one farm around 34,000 chickens are penned into sheds with few windows . About 1,000 farms in the country supply KFC with 23million chickens a year. The programme focuses on a farmer called Andrew who says the chickens at his farm \u2013 left to do nothing but eat and drink until they reach the required weight \u2013 have a good life, saying he \u2018wouldn\u2019t mind being a chicken in here\u2019.

Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: \u2018These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays . The trays of chicken are then distributed to KFC branches nationwide and sold to customers . This is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . \u2018Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. \u2018These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter. A great number suffer broken bones during this process.\u2019 A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers \u2018an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK\u2019s most recognisable businesses\u2019. It is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC.

The student is suing the Davis County School District for $674,000 for emotional damage he says he suffered as a result of the affair, which happened when he was 17, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. His former teacher, 35-year-old Brianne Altice, has been charged with 14 felonies - including rape, sodomy and sex abuse - for allegedly having sexual relationships with three different students. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on \u00a0bail for charges relating to the first two students. Her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars. Not happy: A student who says he had sex with his teacher, Brianne Altice, is now suing the school district. Altice is pictured in court last month after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied . The student who has brought the lawsuit accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claims they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He claims that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. School district spokesman Chris Williams said he was unaware of the lawsuit. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. Locked up: Altice, pictured in court in January, had her bond revoked earlier this year after it emerged she allegedly had sex with a third student while out on bail for having sex with two other students . In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal. Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . Brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in October 2013 to interview her. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' Last month, she requested to drop one of the charges, claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys. But a judge denied the motion. No trial dates have yet been set but she faces up to life in prison if convicted.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbrianne altice, 35-year-old brianne, has been charged with rape, sodomy and sex abuse.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

So did the fathers, for a brief moment, but then, in chorus, they ask\u2122ed: \u2018Um . . . and whose was the . . .?\u2019 Civilized, cultured, happily married men, not a porn-hound or a libertine among them, but they couldn\u2019t help it. Willy-worship, willy-pride, is hard-wired deep in the male brain. However much they deny it, men do seem to care. Actors Jonny Lee Miller (left) and\u00a0Benedict Cumberbatch (right) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark-naked performances as Frankenstein a few years ago . Why else would King\u2019s College London have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure (one hopes not the hard, cold, sharp steel sort) and proudly report that the average length, unstimulated, is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect. I do admire the chaps\u2019 willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler. Brrr. But the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends. And that they all secretly, privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average. The academics explain that it\u2019s all about \u2018using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position\u2019, and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder, and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online. So, don\u2019t tell me men don\u2019t care. Further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing Frankenstein play at the National Theatre a few years ago, in which on alternate nights the role of the Creature, stark-naked during a long opening scene, was taken by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. Conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable, centring on who won that particular contest, and including the immortal line in a theatre-bar argument. \u2018Ah yes, I see what you mean, but is it a show-er or a grower?\u2019 We women edged away, to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being Dr Frankenstein. Libby says she blames author, Jilly Cooper (pictured), for giving men the impression that women are worried about size . Though to be fair, some of the girls were admiring the surrounding abs, pecs, and glutes. We do like a man who looks healthy. It\u2019s a primitive need in the female to bond with a man who is going to be able to take the bins out unaided. But honestly, hand on heart, I suspect that very few of us during early courtship \u2014 or afterwards, or even after the golden wedding \u2014 are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6in average. The idea that we are waiting with a ruler and a scornful frown for the kecks to come off is miles from reality. I blame author Jilly Cooper for giving men that impression, with all her crazed descriptions of things rearing up like the Tower of Pisa, or space shuttles, or \u2014 my least favourite \u2014 a \u2018joyous otter\u2019. I suppose the trouble is that writing sex scenes you have few choices. You can resort to heavy innuendo, or do some Barbara Cartland stuff about being carried away to heaven on wings of bliss. Or you can throw in the towel and pretend the female eye will only be delighted by the spectacle of something that would fit neatly into the London or Manhattan skyline, somewhere between Centrepoint and the Gherkin. Though ideally, of course, not the Shard. The porn industry is obsessed with size, but anyone with half a brain and heart knows porn has little to do with the reality of lovemaking. Most of us have never cared about size. We don\u2019t carry on like the fearsome coven on TV\u2019s Sex And The City, shriekingly comparing notes in the back of taxis or skinny-muffin cafes. It is worth noting, without comment, that much of the genius behind those series and films came from \u2014 ahem \u2014 men. Gay men, in many cases. Out here in the real world, that is not the way women carry on. The only ones I\u2019ve ever known talk about male size were sad, angry girls, unhappy in themselves about their failure to bond happily with any of the possessors of the said tackle. Libby is keen to point out that most women don't carry on like the women in Sex And The City (pictured), comparing detailed notes on the men they know . What we like is much harder to measure. I know a lot of women, and have been one for ages, and it\u2019s simpler than you think. We like hugs, we like tenderness, we like men who seem (often bafflingly) to be delighted and aroused by the very sight of us, even without make-up and a heavy cold. We really like to be laughed into bed and treated with affectionate consideration once we\u2019re there. We like men who think our enjoyment is at least half the point of the exercise, if not a bit more. We approve of chaps, of any dimension, who work out how to make the main event fun all round. We like men who chat and don\u2019t mind being rolled over when they snore or hauled around when they have hogged the duvet. We like faithfulness and kindness, and a man who loves to cuddle the baby even when it\u2019s leaking a bit. And we really like it when they grow out of caring about the 3.6in, or expecting it to be worshipped.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe three and four-year-old boys were snapping at their pyjama elastic.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far \u2014 and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship \u2014 Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . \u2018Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\u2019 said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. \u2018Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. \u2018At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. \u2018We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.\u2019 Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker\u00a0Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England\u2019s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster\u2019s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England\u2019s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: \u2018We don\u2019t control it. It\u2019s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.\u2019 England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . England practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle . Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship\u2019s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born. His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England\u2019s chances, despite Saturday\u2019s missed opportunities. Captain Chris Robshaw knows his side face a tough test against the French if they want to claim a crucial win . England duo Richard Wigglesworth (left) and Robshaw will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy . \u2018It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,\u2019 he said. \u2018We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress. \u2018We\u2019re happy with what we have created. Now it is just a case of doing the last bit. The easier bit is the finishing. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll work on.

They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder. Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering. For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger.

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy. This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with \u00a328million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot. Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected to plant a firm shot past Brad Guzan. Sherwood, who saw his side lose to Stoke in injury time of his Villa debut, was in terse mood afterwards. Defeat hurts him deeply.

Sherwood yells out instructions to his Villa charges as they try to break the deadlock against Garry Monk's men . 'That's the second time it's happened now,' he said. 'There comes a time in a game when if you're looking like not winning it you make sure you don't lose it. We have to try and address that.' It was a close match. Swansea bossed the first half, Villa shaded the second. In the 57th minute Gabby Agbonlahor thought he had scored when Christian Benteke's header fell his way four yards out. But Neil Taylor blocked brilliantly. Scott Sinclair and Fabian Delph both sent good openings wide and Sinclair almost found an equaliser in added time when volleying inches over the bar. By now Benteke had gone off because of a niggling hip problem and Swansea could have extended their winning margin when Routledge ran free close to the end. But Guzan saved well. In the first half the American goalkeeper twice denied Gomis, who should have scored from Taylor's cross on six minutes. He also had a great chance 16 minutes from time after Monetro's ball but Clark diverted the shot away. Gomis was not to be denied, leaving Garry Monk delighted.

(HarperCollins \u00a318.99) Tom Jones has been a genuine global star for half a century. How many other people can say that? By my reckoning, it\u2019s no more than a handful: Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood and HM The Queen. And only one of them, I believe, lives in a larger house than Sir Tom\u2019s. Sir Tom Jones (pictured in Los Angeles in 1978) had his first No 1 in the UK in March 1965 . It was in March 1965 that his first hit, It\u2019s Not Unusual, went to No 1 in the UK and made him famous. To this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. Another significant milestone approaches on June 7, when he will turn 75 years old. All of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed, no-holds-barred hardback biography. Smith\u2019s is not the first \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the twelfth. But it\u2019s the first for nearly two years, and should keep us going until the autumn, when Sir Tom\u2019s autobiography is due out. What else will the great man be able to reveal, given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made? Tom (pictured in early 1970s) married his wife Linda in 1957 when they were both only 16-years-old . For Sir Tom has not lived a particularly secretive life. Though married to Linda, nee Trenchard, for 58 years, and happily so, he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life. But as long as Linda doesn\u2019t have to read about it in the newspaper \u2014 let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t read this \u2014 she turns a blind eye. It\u2019s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it. It\u2019s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it. Such opportunities would never have arisen, of course, without the talent. Jones was born with the gift of a golden voice, and he knows exactly what to do with it. This was apparent on his first hit, and has not wavered since. Tom Jones (pictured) was born\u00a0Thomas Woodward but was persuaded to change his name by his manager\u00a0Gordon Mills, who also persuaded the star to move to London from Wales . Quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but, under the watchful eye of his son, Mark, who has managed him since the mid-Eighties, he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans. Several generations, in fact. The backstory is well known. Babies hear it on their mothers\u2019 knees, and then tell it to their own babies many years later. Born Thomas Woodward in Treforest, South Wales, the infant Tom \u2018had an edge, even as a youngster in short trousers. He didn\u2019t just sing a song; he performed it with verve and passion\u2019. Aged 12, he lost a year at school through tuberculosis; at 16, he was married with a child on the way. \u2018Most of the girls found him very attractive,\u2019 said one schoolmate. \u2018He seemed a bit rough to me, but he definitely had the charisma. He had a way with him, a swagger.\u2019 Tom Jones (right) is pictured with his manager, Gordon Mills (left), in January 1969. Mills worked as the superstar's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986 . The climb from obscurity, though, was long and arduous. Tom was a member of a band called The Senators, who weren\u2019t going anywhere terribly fast. A sharp-eyed young manager, Gordon Mills, persuaded him to move to London, change his name to \u2018Tom Jones\u2019 and begin a solo career. He was already in his mid-20s. For 20 years, until Gordon died of cancer, Tom always deferred to his expertise. In return, Gordon did all Tom\u2019s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking. It was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly. Hits in the Sixties led to Las Vegas in the Seventies, and what might best be described as the Underwear Throwing Years. No bow-tie was larger or fluffier than Tom\u2019s, no hips swivelled more suggestively. Elvis was a good friend and was convinced Tom wore a sock down the front of his trousers. Tom knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them, though he didn\u2019t like it when John Lennon, with his characteristic Scouse wit, called him a \u2018Welsh poof\u2019. Would anyone? Tom (pictured) has been a judge on the Voice UK talent show since 2012, as has will.i.am (pictured) Nonetheless, an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when Tom recorded five consecutive country albums in the early Eighties. The live tours and Vegas residencies had made him hedge-fund rich. He and Linda lived in splendour in California, with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner. But was it making him happy? Well, yes, but at the same time, Tom clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier, rootsier music he had first loved. It hasn\u2019t been an entirely easy ride since then, but his last two studio albums, Praise & Blame (2010) and Spirit In The Room (2012), have been the best of his long career. What comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man. Other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises, when they have clearly had the lot done. Sir Tom Jones has also had the lot done \u2014 but cheerfully admits to it. He has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket, yet is generous with family and close friends, as you or I would be in his position. He doesn\u2019t like drugs or gambling, but enjoys a good cigar, and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good. Sir Tom (pictured), unlike many other celebrities, has admitted to having had plastic surgery work . Smith is an efficient chronicler of the life, as befits an old pro whose previous books have included Kylie, Gary (Barlow), Alesha (Dixon), Tulisa, Kate (Middleton), Cheryl and, of course, Victoria. There are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge: Leonard Cohen\u2019s song is called Tower Of Song, not Tower Of Strength, for instance, and he doesn\u2019t know that Burt Bacharach did not write the lyrics to his songs, which is a bit poor. But his book bounces along happily enough, forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every-thing and become universally adored. As Rob Brydon put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award: \u2018Tom Jones has lived the life we would all love to live.\u2019 I have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept, and Sir Tom probably sang It\u2019s Not Unusual for about the 20,000th time.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe fame is untainted and talent uneroded.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as \u2018a unique moment in anyone\u2019s life\u2019. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince\u2019s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne\u2019s frustrations is the so-called \u2018Middletonisation\u2019 of his son William\u2019s life \u2014 specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole\u2019s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called \u2018March of the Middletons\u2019 that he has complained to friends: \u2018They never let me see my grandson.\u2019 Adds a source: \u2018Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.\u2019 It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles\u2019s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it\u2019s a deliberate move on William\u2019s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles\u2019s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate\u2019s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot\u2019s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William\u2019s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

Dozens more hounds emerge from a stand of trees and bound across a field in search of a fox's scent. Horses carrying riders in red and black coats follow from a ways behind, quickly disappearing again over a hillcrest, minutes away from Baltimore's growing suburbs. The Elkridge-Harford Hunt Club has roots dating back to 1878, but records show organized foxhunts took place in Maryland as early as the 1790s.

According to the website of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, there are nearly 160 organized foxhunting clubs in the U.S. and Canada. And while the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns 10 years ago is still debated, the American hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill a fox. In many places red foxes are a rarity in the US so the hounds chase coyotes - a distant cousin of the fox - instead. But from dress to decorum, many of the traditions remain unaltered from its inception.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nAhead of Super Saturday, Sportsmail's Sir Clive Woodward rates the three contenders for the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title... ENGLAND . Why they can win it . I\u2019m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in. George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France. Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster\u2019s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance. Bath fly half George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline this season . England and Wasps flanker James Haskell runs with the ball during training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Stuart Lancaster has been in charge of England for four seasons but has yet to secure a Six Nations title . They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven\u2019t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It\u2019s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there\u2019s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster\u2019s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 \u2014 and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity \u2014 but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi\u2019s absence hasn\u2019t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach\u2019s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster \u2014 compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O\u2019Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe\u2019s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don\u2019t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O\u2019Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach\u2019s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent\u2019s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He\u2019s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach\u2019s strengths? Warren Gatland\u2019s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him \u2014 the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I\u2019d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nstuart lancaster's side are yet to win this competition.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup. They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them. England coach Peter Moores talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time . Moores finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level . But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job. 'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better. 'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment \u2013 to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament. 'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old b\u00eate noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice.\u00a0The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the\u00a0Polytechnic University of Valencia, said:\u00a0'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts. 'These produce a strange flavour or odour, a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration. 'Using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing.'

Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup. They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them. England coach Peter Moores talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time . Moores finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level . But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job. 'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better. 'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment \u2013 to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament. 'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old b\u00eate noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice.\u00a0The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the\u00a0Polytechnic University of Valencia, said:\u00a0'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts.

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far \u2014 and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship \u2014 Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope.

You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. \u2018We need to make sure we convert those into points.

Northampton Saints flanker\u00a0Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England\u2019s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster\u2019s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England\u2019s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: \u2018We don\u2019t control it. It\u2019s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.\u2019 England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons.

Leo Dennis Kozlowski, 68, lives in a small, rented apartment in midtown Manhattan with his third wife, Kimberly, 48, whom he met while he was spending time at Mid-State Correctional Facility in upstate New York. Kozlowski was jailed in 2005 for taking unauthorized bonuses, conspiracy and other charges.\u00a0He was also ordered to pay $167 million in restitution and fines. Former chief executive of Tyco International Dennis Kozlowski and second wife Karen leave New York State Supreme Court in June 2005 soon after he was found guilty of stealing $150 million . Kozlowski, poses with two women in toga costumes in a frame taken from an amateur video tape of the lavish $2.1 million, week-long  party for his second wife Karen's 40th birthday . Last month, he completed his parole after spending three years on work-release. He spent almost seven years behind bars for his white-collar crimes although he faced up to 25 years. During his time in jail, he was separated from other prisoners due to his 'high-profile' status. Although he knows that he did wrong, Kozlowski admitted to The New York Times in a recent interview that he feels plenty more on Wall Street did not pay the price. Kozlowski's fall from grace - known as 'deal-a-day' Dennis, he turned Massachusetts-based Tyco from a small firm into a $150billion force \u00a0- was a gripping case of schadenfreude for the tabloids because of the gaudy life of excess he had led. In the early 2000s, The New York Post published a picture of him under the headline 'Oink Oink' after revelations emerged of his\u00a0$6,000 gold-and-burgundy shower curtain in his lavish, $30million 5th Avenue apartment paid for by Tyco. But as he told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0this week: 'I was piggy. But I\u2019m not that person anymore.' Kozlowski's princely lifestyle was legendary - he owned a multi-million-dollar art collection and had an oceanfront estate in Nantucket and a mansion tucked in an exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. Tyco also paid half of the $2million cost of Kozlowski's second wife, Karen's 40th birthday party in 2001. Held on the island of Sardinia, the bash had a 'Roman orgy' theme and featured an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David urinating Stolichnaya vodka. \u00a0Jimmy Buffet was flown in to perform. Karen Mayo (second left)  poses with a friend and two men in gladiator costumes at her $2million birthday bash - half of which was paid for by Tyco . The Tyco CEO once had a home in this exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. He also owned a home in Nantucket and on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan . The businessman also owned a 130-foot yacht, Endeavor, which he would sail around the world to compete in regattas. Life now, couldn't be more different. Mr Kozlowski's time behind bars has given him perspective on simple pleasures. He loves spending time with his grandchildren, enjoys subway rides, eating avocados - and even trips to the dentist. He also paid tribute to his third wife Kimberly Fusaro - a divorced Wall Street trader whom he met behind bars after she began writing to him. She began visiting him in 2009 and sending fresh fruit and vegetables from the garden of her Long Island cottage. He proposed to her with a $300 Cubic zirconium ring and they got married last year. He also got a job as part of his parole requirement. He borrowed an office from a friend in Midtown and consults on low-profile\u00a0mergers and acquisitions. He would not discuss his finances with The Times but claimed to have 'no real estate' and a hold a 'minuscule percentage' of the New York Yankees. Fortunately for its  employees, Tyco is still standing, making security systems and employing around 57,000 people.

ENGLAND . Why they can win it . I\u2019m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in. George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France. Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster\u2019s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance. Bath fly half George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline this season . England and Wasps flanker James Haskell runs with the ball during training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Stuart Lancaster has been in charge of England for four seasons but has yet to secure a Six Nations title . They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven\u2019t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It\u2019s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there\u2019s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster\u2019s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 \u2014 and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity \u2014 but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi\u2019s absence hasn\u2019t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach\u2019s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster \u2014 compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O\u2019Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe\u2019s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don\u2019t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O\u2019Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach\u2019s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent\u2019s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He\u2019s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach\u2019s strengths? Warren Gatland\u2019s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him \u2014 the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I\u2019d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ndespite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. \"Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further,\" the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. \"We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax.

Aubrey said she was also told her son would be eligible for a wheelchair when he is five years old. Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a miniature wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk. Scroll down for video . A California boy, two, who was born paralyzed from the waist down has been denied a wheelchair from his parent's insurance company which would allow him to be more independent (above Crue Allred) Aubrey (right) and Joe Allred (center), the parents of toddler Crue (left), said they wanted their son to have a wheelchair, however, Anthem Blue Cross has refused to grant him one because he is too young. Aubrey said she was told he would be eligible when he is five years old . Aubrey, 29, a mother-of-two, said she is heartbroken because she believes her son should have the freedom to be independent,  according to Fox News. The family submitted a claim for a wheelchair which was rejected in October. They resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago. On March 3, Aubrey wrote on Facebook that the claim had been denied. She wrote: 'I know that our son is only two but his mobility shouldn't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company, who has never met him. 'Crue is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think. I don't know where he would be without his little ZipZac chair. That chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own. 'He's been using that chair for almost two years now (no thanks to the insurance). I just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age, the difference they'd be making in their lives. 'An able child learns to walk at the age of one so why is it not okay for a young disabled child to learn to use a chair at the age of two?' Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a small wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk (Crue pictured above in his ZipZac wheelchair) Anthem Blue Cross has said the child's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline. 'Our records reflect that claim was denied because their doctor, despite efforts by Anthem to obtain this information, did not provide necessary documentation before the legal deadline to process a claim expired,' Darrel Ng, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross told Fox News. The insurance company also said the family can appeal the decision that the chair is not necessary for Crue, according to ABC. The toddler's parents plan to appeal the decision and keep fighting for their son. Insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross, said the child's doctor is at fault for submitting the required documents in a timely fashion (above, Crue pictured in February during his routine kidney and bladder check up) Crue's parents plan to appeal the decision given by the insurance company and will keep fighting for their son (above Crue pictured in January enjoying sled hockey) Aubrey began sharing her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend of theirs to start a donation\u00a0page to help raise funds so that Crue could have a new wheelchair. As their friend, Chanda Clark Steggell, was only intending to raise $10,000, by Saturday $15,995 had been raised in donations. Now Crue will also be able to have a standing walker and standing wheelchair. The donations will also help with many other of his other medical needs that are incurred on both a weekly and monthly basis. Since Aubrey shared her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend to help raise nearly $16,000 by Saturday. Now Crue will get a new wheelchair, as well as a standing walker and a standing wheelchair (above the Facebook post thanking people for generous donations) Aubrey said she gets teary-eyed thinking about all of the donations, and that she along with Joe are determined to show Crue that he can do whatever he wants in life (above Aubrey and Joe) 'This little boy is beyond shocked and so grateful for all the donations he has gotten,' a recent Facebook post said. 'He just wants to thank each and every one of you for all you love, support, prayers, and kind words. 'We are truly blessed to have such amazing people in our lives.'

Now engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms and give them the same ability as the colourful reptile. The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand, by  bending it. Engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms, giving them the  ability to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon . Researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies, colour-shifting camouflage, and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges and aircraft. \u2018This is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon-like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it,\u2019 said Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain, a member of the University of California Berkeley team that developed the material. They made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair. The markings enabled them to select the range of colours the material would reflect, depending on how it was flexed and bent. Engineers made the material (illustrated) by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair . The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand like a chameleon (stock image), by applying a minimal amount of force . Chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells. The colours we see in paints and fabrics, for example, occur when white broad spectrum light strikes their surfaces. The unique chemical composition of each surface then absorbs various bands, or wavelengths of light. Bands that aren\u2019t absorbed are reflected back, with shorter wavelengths giving objects a blue hue and longer wavelengths appearing redder, with a rainbow of possible combinations in between. While autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make-up, the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light. Professor Chang-Hasnain said that such \u2018structural colour\u2019 is much less common in nature, but is used by some butterflies and beetles to create a an iridescent display. To make the material, the Berkeley team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon, which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility. Rather than spreading the light into a complete rainbow, the ridges reflect a specific wavelength of light. Other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards, active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate\u00a0structural fatigue in bridges, for example. A stock image of Crescent City Connection Bridge in New Orleans is shown . By \u2018tuning\u2019 the spaces between the ridges, Professor Chang-Hasnain said it is possible to select the specific colour to be reflected. They realised it would be possible to subtly shift the spaces between the ridges, and therefore the colour, by flexing or bending the material. As the silicone is bent or flexed, the gaps between the ridges respond . Professor Chang-Hasnain said: \u2018If you have a surface with very precise structures, spaced so they can interact with a specific wavelength of light, you can change its properties and how it interacts with light by changing its dimensions.\u2019 The study, published in the journal Optica, says the material is easy to manufacture with the desired surface properties and is able to reflect very pure colours, reflecting up to 83 per cent of the incoming light. So far the experts have created a piece of material that\u2019s one square centimetre, so more time and research is needed before clothes can be created, for example. Professor Chang-Hasnain said: \u2018The next step is to make this larger-scale and there are facilities already that could do so. \u2018At that point, we hope to be able to find applications in entertainment, security, and monitoring.\u2019 She said the chameleon material to make a new type of billboard as well as create an active camouflage on the exterior of vehicles that would change colour to better match the surrounding environment. It could also be used to make sensors that would change colour to indicate that structural fatigue was stressing critical components on bridges, buildings, or the wings of airplanes. \u2018This is the first time anyone has achieved such a broad range of colour on a one-layer, thin and flexible surface. I think it\u2019s extremely cool,\u2019 she said.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthey made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to McLaren in the early years and then moving to Mercedes for the 2013 season, despite the aristocracy of British motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team. The importance of making the correct decision was reinforced on the podium after Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, when he saw Sebastian Vettel on the top step after the German\u2019s own successful move from Red Bull to Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton sits on the podium alongside Sebastian Vettel after he claimed his first victory for Ferrari . Hamilton, out of contract at the end of the season, says his new Mercedes deal will be completed this week . Hamilton, who finished second, also thought of Fernando Alonso, whose career management has been disastrous since he left Renault in 2005, the year he won the last of his two world titles. The Spaniard then walked out on McLaren when he could have won a third championship, went back to Renault as a stop-gap, joined Ferrari while it was moribund and returned to McLaren this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners Honda. Alonso managed less than half of Sunday\u2019s race before a cooling problem intervened. Vettel, in only his second race for Ferrari, won in the car Alonso had just vacated. \u2018It\u2019s nice to see Ferrari back up,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I sat next to Sebastian and thought to myself, \u201cWhat is Fernando thinking?\u201d I remember when I left McLaren and came here, we were better the next year. I had a good feeling then, but he\u2019s almost done the opposite of what I did. It could have been him today. It\u2019s just strange how things turn out. Hamilton finished behind race-winner Vettel in Sepang but still remains in the lead of the world championship . Hamilton led Vettel off the start-line at the Malaysian Grand Prix but eventually lost out to the German . \u2018McLaren are a fantastic team. It looks bad now but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get it together. Before you know it, it will be the three of us fighting, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u2019 Alonso\u2019s predicament is a terrible shame because he was the heir who supplanted Michael Schumacher as the German approached his first retirement in 2009. Hamilton, 30, does not want to fall into the same trap, and says he is ready to sign a new contract with Mercedes for three more years beyond this season. The tantalising prospect of his joining Ferrari, where he is hugely admired by president Sergio Marchionne, seems remote. They have Vettel and Hamilton is already part of a top team. No matter Sunday\u2019s result \u2014 Hamilton beaten on pure pace by Vettel\u2019s Ferrari \u2014 Mercedes are the team of the moment. Asked about signing for Ferrari, Hamilton said: \u2018No, don\u2019t be silly. My contract at Mercedes should be done this week. There\u2019s no reason why not. Honestly, it\u2019s 99.6 per cent done.\u2019 Hamilton is expected to earn more than his current annual \u00a320million salary when he pens his new deal . The exact terms of drivers\u2019 contracts are kept secret, but it is thought that Hamilton will get more than his current annual \u00a320million salary, though probably not match Vettel\u2019s deal at Ferrari, which could be worth up to \u00a335m if he collects all his bonuses and extras. The Mercedes board want their team to be cost-efficient and will not pay the Earth even for a driver of Hamilton\u2019s talent. As well as tying up the contract, Mercedes will spend the fortnight before the next race in China responding to the Ferrari challenge. It is believed that the cooler temperatures expected in Shanghai will favour Mercedes, but at least their defeat after eight successive wins relieved the monotony. \u2018I don\u2019t think Ferrari\u2019s win is a one-off,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I don\u2019t think they were lucky or it was a fluke. There\u2019s always talk that they are easier on their tyres. \u2018I think we\u2019ll manage. We\u2019ve got a great group of people, a great approach, and from this we\u2019ll take a step back. \u2018Second for me and third for Nico (Rosberg) is still good but they\u2019re too close to us in the championship, so we\u2019ll work very hard to analyse. It was not a kick; it was a pinch. We have now got a race on our hands.\u2019 That is good news for the sport and hope for all the teams.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsebastian vettel is on the podium after sunday's malaysian grand prix.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

According to the website of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, there are nearly 160 organized foxhunting clubs in the U.S. and Canada. And while the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns 10 years ago is still debated, the American hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill a fox. In many places red foxes are a rarity in the US so the hounds chase coyotes - a distant cousin of the fox - instead.

Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup. They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them. England coach Peter Moores talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time . Moores finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level . But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job. 'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better. 'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment \u2013 to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament. 'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old b\u00eate noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

It is understood that Livesey, on loan to Morecambe from Preston North End, has admitted the charge. His case will now be heard by an Independent Regulatory Commission.

But from a very young age, the youngster from Los Angeles knew it simply wasn't the case. The transgender 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two, setting his physical 'parts' aside. Writing for CNN, he has described how he knew he was male long before he discovered the terms 'gay' and 'sexuality', and the difficulty he encountered with other people's perceptions growing up. He also urges parents to let children set out their path - no matter their gender. Avery Wallace (right) poses for a picture with his sister Riley in 2002 at the age of three. He claims he knew he was a boy when he was two . His parents let him cut his hair short for his preschool graduation, even though he was wearing a dress . Describing life as a toddler, he said: 'I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind - not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. 'No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part.' He said he first heard the term 'gay' in second grade, even after he had his first 'girlfriend', and remembered how one year 'a penis' was at the top of his Christmas list. However he feared people may perceive him as 'different' when he learned homosexuality was considered by some to be abnormal. 'I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay - but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.' At the age of seven he started to prefer wearing boys clothes and by eight, he was playing baseball . Avery was elected class president in the fifth grade by his peers. He strongly stated that he was a boy\u00a0and the 'people that mattered knew it too, for the most part' He is pictured at age 10 with short, curly hair. By now he was living the life of a boy, but the word transgender hadn't formed part of his vocabulary . Avery described how he was able to become the boy he wanted, because he grew up in a house that taught him to 'love anyone I wanted to.' 'That said,' he added. 'I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either.' When he entered middle school, he grew out his hair and started to wear dresses as to avoid the 'emotional torture'. But in 2012, when he was 12, he told his parents he was transgender. He is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment after attending a number of group sessions, and has urged people to consider categorizing people into boys and girls more carefully. 'I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight,' Avery said. He added: 'Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was.' Avery wore a suit and lavender waistcoat for his fifth grade graduation, but from then on he grew out his hair and some times wore a dress to avoid the 'emotional torture' of middle school .

The dispute between the party\u2019s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co\u2019 at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics \u2013 as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party\u2019s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November.

Detectives are hunting for the attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl last Friday. Officers described the footage as 'harrowing', but released it in an effort to identify the attacker, who struck at a bus stop on the outskirts of Leeds in the Beeston area of the city. The attacker drags the young 18-year-old girl from the bus stop into the front garden to begin his attack . The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to \u00a0pummel her with a large stone . The attacker, is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and is in his early 20s, with receding black hair. He is of slim build. The footage shows the man drag the girl onto an area of grass behind the busy bus stop. Detectives believe that several motorists passed the scene during the attack and fear that the man will strike again if not caught. Officers said the man hit the defenceless girl with a large stone to subdue her before subjecting her to a serious sexual assault. The unidentified man then left his victim for dead. Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.' He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties. If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.' At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot . Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari . The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week . The detective described the footage calling it 'harrowing in nature', but said police hoped its release may jog the memories of anyone in the area when the attack happened at 11.50pm last Friday. 'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop. It is absolutely appalling', he said. 'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead. 'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road. 'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless. 'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released.

Clinton turned over to a House committee investigating the 2012 . attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, show her aides . sometimes used their personal email accounts to communicate with . her through her own private account. Clinton said during a March 10 press conference that 'the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.' That, she claimed then, 'meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department' for archiving, where they would turn up in searches conducted in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. But The New York Times reported on Monday that some of the approximately 300 Clinton emails examined by a congressional committee  suggest otherwise. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton could be waving goodbye to her presidential ambitions if 'email-gate' gets deeper. She spoke at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress on Monday . LOST TO HISTORY? Former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Huma Abedin (right) was one of her closest aides, and emailed Clinton in a conversation where both women used personal accounts . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . The emails from Clinton, a presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, do not prove the former . secretary of state ordered a 'stand down,' stopping U.S. forces . from responding to the Benghazi attack or participated in a related cover-up, the newspaper reported,  citing four senior . government officials. But they do raise new questions about how much of Clinton's correspondence has been lost to history. Federal record retention laws are designed to prevent the kind of archive side-stepping Clinton is accused of carrying on for the four years she led the State Department. Congress subpoenaed email records last week from 'close to a dozen' people who worked for Hillary Clinton at State. The Times report is the latest revelation in the saga over . Clinton and her use of a personal email address to conduct . government business, as well as a private computer server to . store that correspondence. PROBLEMS: Clinton has been dogged by allegations that she purposely hid incriminating emails from the State Department \u2013 and from public records requesters \u2013 by keeping all her emails on a private server . Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Times that Clinton's . aides primarily used their work email to correspond with her . about government matters, adding that 'only the tiniest fraction . of the more than 1 million emails they sent or received involved . their personal accounts.' According to the Times, she occasionally exchanged emails with at least four aides via personal accounts while she was . at the State Department, including her foreign policy adviser, . Jake Sullivan; chief of staff, Cheryl Mills; senior adviser, . Philippe Reines; and her personal aide, Huma Abedin. Abedin used an email address on Clinton's private server in addition to her official 'dot-gov' address. Mills reportedly did the same. Clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account, calling it a matter of 'convenience.' In one email exchange cited by the Times, she asked an aide to assess the performance of a top State official before Congress. 'Did we survive the day?' she wrote. 'Survive, yes,' the adviser responded. DAMAGE CONTROL? It's not clear what Clinton's inner circle said to her about her turn before the US Senate \u2013 the infamous 'What difference does it make?' moment \u2013 because the former secretary's emails were outside the State Department's archive system . In separate exchanges weeks later, Sullivan wrote Clinton to reassure her that she wouldn't be held to account in the same way as then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice, who falsely claimed on national television that the death and destruction in Benghazi was the consequence of a protest that spiraled out of control. 'She did make clear our view that this started spontaneously then evolved,' he wrote to Clinton at one point, seeming to reinforce the idea that the Obama administration planned to stick with that assessment.. Later, when the White House began referring to Benghazi as a 'terror attack,' Sullivan told Clinton that in her own publiccomments she had steered clear of the nettles that had snared Rice. 'You never said \u2018spontaneous\u2019 or characterized their motivations,' he wrote, according to the Times. Details on conversations like these are sketchy: The Times wasn't permitted to look at the emails, but relied on descriptions from four different sources. COULD IT BE? Housing secretary Julian Castro (right) has been talked about as a potential presidential candidate and would catch momentum if Hillary Clinton's email scandal derailed her campaign hopes . PROBE: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy chairs a special congressional committee looking into the Benghazi attacks, and has subpoenaed emails from 'close to a dozen' current and past Clinton aides . Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators . BECAUSE I'M HAPPY? Clinton is her party's presumed presidential front-runner, having come in second to Barack Obama in 2008 . A spokesman for the Republican-controlled House Select . Committee on Benghazi declined to comment, according to the . newspaper. Clinton has said she gave copies of all work-related emails . to the State Department, but Republicans, who see her as their . top target in the run-up to the 2016 election, continued to . press for more records. Last week Republicans asked the State Department to hand . over numerous documents related to Clinton's use of private . email while she was secretary of state and have called on her to . hand over her email server to a third party. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the . House committee investigating Benghazi, has said he does not . think Clinton has given the committee all emails related to the . attack and last week extended the deadline for her to turn them . over.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nclinton said the majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Beleaguered travellers have been warned that \u2018Easter is cancelled\u2019 as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed. On others they face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. Worst affected will be the West Coast main line, where Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. Scroll down for video . Passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects (file picture) The West Coast mainline, the Great Western and the Greater Anglia line are all planning works on key routes meaning passengers will face hours on rail replacement services or slower routes . The line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will have a four-day shutdown. On Easter Sunday a 55-minute direct trip from Rugby to London Euston will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes, with two trains and two buses. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: \u2018Easter is effectively cancelled \u2013 our line is shut. We\u2019re advising people not to travel. \u2018What makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering. This is unusual.\u2019 Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a  report has found . Other services blighted by engineering works include London Midland, which uses the same West Coast line and has issued a similar warning, and swathes of the Great Western and Greater Anglia lines. Virgin services to Manchester and the North West and Birmingham are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised for disruption from the \u00a3100million works by 14,000 engineering workers, but insisted it was vital. However, the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at Christmas when the key East Coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works, prompting a major inquiry, damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs, and a grovelling apology from rail bosses. Cancellations: The report found that\u00a0when work near King's Cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at Finsbury Park station but 'not enough was done' to manage passenger flow at the new station . Under a large headline on its website, Virgin Trains warns passengers of the impending Easter chaos with the words: \u2018There\u2019s a spanner in the works. Don\u2019t get caught in planned improvement works.\u2019 It said there would not be any trains to or from London Euston, adding: \u2018There won\u2019t be any replacement shuttles either, so finding an alternative train service to London will be very difficult.\u2019 Engineering works on the line between Crewe and Warrington and from Carlisle to Glasgow will \u2018severely reduce services to the North and Scotland\u2019, it said. Services are also likely to be \u2018extra busy the day before and after affected days\u2019 and passengers should book early. West Coast passengers also face major works at Watford Junction from an \u00a381million programme from Network Rail \u2018to improve the ageing infrastructure\u2019. Rail bosses say carrying out works during Christmas and Easter is justified as passenger numbers are down by up to 40 per cent because there are far fewer commuters. But ministers have suggested carrying out such works at times other than at Christmas and Easter \u2013 such as through the summer \u2013 to avoid hitting families travelling during the key holiday periods. Mr Carne said: \u2018We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays to reunite with their friends and families, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period, but there will be disruption for some.\u2019 He insisted that there were \u2018good contingency plans in place\u2019 while the improvements are carried out.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\npassengers face travel chaos this easter as britain's busiest rail routes are expected.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Aubrey, 29, a mother-of-two, said she is heartbroken because she believes her son should have the freedom to be independent,  according to Fox News. The family submitted a claim for a wheelchair which was rejected in October. They resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago. On March 3, Aubrey wrote on Facebook that the claim had been denied. She wrote: 'I know that our son is only two but his mobility shouldn't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company, who has never met him. 'Crue is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think. I don't know where he would be without his little ZipZac chair. That chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own. 'He's been using that chair for almost two years now (no thanks to the insurance). I just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age, the difference they'd be making in their lives.

Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a small wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk (Crue pictured above in his ZipZac wheelchair) Anthem Blue Cross has said the child's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline. 'Our records reflect that claim was denied because their doctor, despite efforts by Anthem to obtain this information, did not provide necessary documentation before the legal deadline to process a claim expired,' Darrel Ng, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross told Fox News.

In a statement released on Monday, the league announced that the Falcons have been fined $350,000 (\u00a3237,000)\u00a0and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft. If the Falcons have multiple picks in that round, the highest selection will be forfeited. Team president Rich McKay has also been suspended from the league's Competition Committee beginning April 1. Atlanta Falcons have been fined \u00a3237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome . Owner Arthur Blank acknowledged the team's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . The NFL noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the Falcons violated league rules that state 'at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.' The league also said Roddy White, the team's former director of event marketing, was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club. The Falcons fired him. The league determined that Falcons ownership and senior executives, including McKay, were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise. But as the senior club executive overseeing game operations, McKay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules. McKay can petition Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than June 30. The Falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Falcons president Rick McKay has been suspended from his position on NFL Competition Committee . Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in early February that he had seen enough of the NFL's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club. 'It's not really a fine line,' Blank said. 'I think what we've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong. Anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field, we're opposed to, as a league, as a club and as an owner. It's obviously embarrassing but beyond embarrassing it doesn't represent our culture and what we're about.' The Falcons say 101 of 103 games have been sellouts since Blank bought the team in 2002. Actual turnouts declined during losing seasons the last two years. Atlanta ranked 10th among the 32 NFL teams with its average home attendance of 72,130 in 2014. Construction is underway for a new $1.4 billion stadium that will replace the Georgia Dome in 2017.

Neville is currently a member of the England coaching staff and has been linked with the top job once Hodgson, who has been in charge since 2012, leaves the post. However, former Manchester United captain Neville has never managed a club or international side before and Pearce has described suggestions the 40-year-old could take over the national team without that experience as 'incredible'. Stuart Pearce does not believe Gary Neville has the experience to replace Roy Hodgson . Former Manchester United defender Neville has been tipped to replace Hodgson . Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Pearce, who was in charge of England Under-21s for six years and also took caretaker charge of the senior team following Fabio Capello's resignation, told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek: 'You only really know what it's like to manage when you're in that technical area and you're the manager. 'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both. 'You can't replicate what it's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you. 'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position. 'Gary will get that eventually, but I think he needs, like anybody, to gain the experience, maybe in club football, as a manager and after that probably in international football as well.'

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far \u2014 and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship \u2014 Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . \u2018Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\u2019 said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. \u2018Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. \u2018At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. \u2018We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.\u2019 Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker\u00a0Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England\u2019s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster\u2019s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England\u2019s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: \u2018We don\u2019t control it. It\u2019s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.\u2019 England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . England practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle . Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship\u2019s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born. His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England\u2019s chances, despite Saturday\u2019s missed opportunities. Captain Chris Robshaw knows his side face a tough test against the French if they want to claim a crucial win . England duo Richard Wigglesworth (left) and Robshaw will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy . \u2018It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,\u2019 he said. \u2018We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress. \u2018We\u2019re happy with what we have created.

Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as \u2018a unique moment in anyone\u2019s life\u2019. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince\u2019s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne\u2019s frustrations is the so-called \u2018Middletonisation\u2019 of his son William\u2019s life \u2014 specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole\u2019s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called \u2018March of the Middletons\u2019 that he has complained to friends: \u2018They never let me see my grandson.\u2019 Adds a source: \u2018Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.\u2019 It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles\u2019s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it\u2019s a deliberate move on William\u2019s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles\u2019s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate\u2019s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot\u2019s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William\u2019s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

Beleaguered travellers have been warned that \u2018Easter is cancelled\u2019 as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed. On others they face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. Worst affected will be the West Coast main line, where Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. Scroll down for video . Passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects (file picture) The West Coast mainline, the Great Western and the Greater Anglia line are all planning works on key routes meaning passengers will face hours on rail replacement services or slower routes . The line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will have a four-day shutdown. On Easter Sunday a 55-minute direct trip from Rugby to London Euston will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes, with two trains and two buses. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: \u2018Easter is effectively cancelled \u2013 our line is shut. We\u2019re advising people not to travel. \u2018What makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering. This is unusual.\u2019 Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a  report has found . Other services blighted by engineering works include London Midland, which uses the same West Coast line and has issued a similar warning, and swathes of the Great Western and Greater Anglia lines. Virgin services to Manchester and the North West and Birmingham are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised for disruption from the \u00a3100million works by 14,000 engineering workers, but insisted it was vital. However, the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at Christmas when the key East Coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works, prompting a major inquiry, damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs, and a grovelling apology from rail bosses. Cancellations: The report found that\u00a0when work near King's Cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at Finsbury Park station but 'not enough was done' to manage passenger flow at the new station . Under a large headline on its website, Virgin Trains warns passengers of the impending Easter chaos with the words: \u2018There\u2019s a spanner in the works. Don\u2019t get caught in planned improvement works.\u2019 It said there would not be any trains to or from London Euston, adding: \u2018There won\u2019t be any replacement shuttles either, so finding an alternative train service to London will be very difficult.\u2019 Engineering works on the line between Crewe and Warrington and from Carlisle to Glasgow will \u2018severely reduce services to the North and Scotland\u2019, it said.

The catfish has been named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, in Alabama, as Peckoltia greedoi after the fictional alien bounty hunter. The fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil and has large dark eyes, protruding birstles and a sucker mouth. The new species of catfish Peckoltia greedoi (left) has large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty hunter Greedo (right) in that featured briefly at the start of the first installment of the original Star Wars films . Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films. Yoda purpurata - a deep sea worm . Han solo - an extinct species of trilobite found in southern China . Aptostichus sarlaac\u00a0- a species of trapdoor spider . Tetramorium jedi - a Madagascan ant . Darthvaderum - an Australian arboreal mite . Polemistus chewbacca - a wasp . Agathidium vaderi - a species of beetle . He said: 'Chris looked at the specimen and said \"that looks like that guy from Star Wars\". 'After a little prodding, I realised he was talking about Greedo. 'We then knew what the name had to be. 'The Peckoltia greedoi does bear a striking resemblance to Greedo. 'As a seven-year-old kid, I watched Star Wars in the theatre and it was a life-changing experience for me. 'I became a lifelong fan, and I now share that with my son. 'Greedo has always been a personal favourite of mine.' Greedo, a bug-eyed green alien from the spaceport Mos Espa, was killed by Han Solo in a brief scene close to the start of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It is not the first new species to be named after characters from the Star Wars films. Even though taxonomy is considered to be a serious business, those naming new species often have a lot of fun with the names. In 2012 marine biologists named a purple deep sea worm Yoda purpurata after the Jedi knight from Star Wars - Yoda. Professor Jonathan Armbruster (pictured above on the right with student Carrie Allison left) named the new species of catfish after his favourite character from the Star Wars films that he watched as a young boy . Peckoltia greedoi (shown above) has bug-eyes, bristles on its cheeks and a large sucker mouth . There is also a small parasite that lives on a burrowing crab known as Albunione yoda. A fossil trilobite which was found to belong to a new genus was given the name Han solo by a palaeobiologist Samuel Turvey. Jason Bong, director of the Auburn University Museum of Natural Hisotry also named a new species of trapdoor spider the Aptostichus sarlaac, after the sarlacc monster that appears in the Return of the Jedi. A species of ant in Madagascar is called Tetramorium jedi, while an entire genus of mite in Australia is called Darthvaderum. There are also three species of wasp called Polemistus chewbacca, Polemistus vaderi and Polemistus yoda. Professor Armbuster himself has named more than 40 new species of fish. Peckoltia greedoi was first discovered in 1998 but had not been described as a new species until this year. Two other new species - Peckoltia ephippiata and Peckoltia lujani - were found alongside it. He said: 'In biology, taxonomy is probably the most important science. 'We have not even completed cataloging all of the species found locally, and in places like South America, it sometimes feels like we have barely started. 'We need names to be able to discuss anything about the biology of the organisms, and it is the one branch of biology used by every biologist alive.' The purple deep sea worm above was named Yoda purpurata, after the Jedi knight from the Star Wars films .

A drinking competition went tragically wrong when a student died after downing 25 shots of vodka. Humberto Moura Fonseca, 23, had been partying at the university of Julio de Mesquita in the city of Bauru, in southwest Brazil, when organisers suggested the drinking game to see who could drink 25 shots in less than 60 seconds. His friend Rodrigo Pancetti, 23, said: 'We were all having a great time and someone came up with the idea of the drinking competition. 'I knew I'd already had too much and there was no way I was going to be able to drink five, let alone 25. But Humberto and the others were really up for it. 'On his Facebook there is a quote, a motto, from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky which says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom. I never thought that would become reality.

This most brilliant yet political of drivers, who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun \u2018I\u2019, delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly, courteously and devastatingly. A steering problem, he told a press conference before Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, was the cause of the McLaren driver\u2019s apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in Barcelona last month. Just one thing: McLaren repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car. Calling on every conceivable bit of tele-metry, they compiled a 37-page report, which they presented to the FIA, substantiating that view. Fernando Alonso stands in front of the world's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of Sunday's race . The Spaniard is back in action this weekend after missing the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in Barcelona . \u2018The steering problem came in the middle of turn three,\u2019 elaborated Alonso, who missed the opening race in Melbourne as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career. \u2018It locked into the right and when I approached the wall I braked at the last moment, I downshifted from fifth to third, and unfortunately we are still missing some data.\u2019 How routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers, including a host of former drivers. \u2018I\u2019ve listened to Alonso\u2019s very clear explanation of the incident,\u2019 said broadcaster Martin Brundle, who drove in 158 grands prix. \u2018Now I\u2019m really confused.\u2019 One of the FIA\u2019s most senior technical officials commended McLaren\u2019s report as honest and robust. Why, then, would the Spaniard blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence? Alonso is set for his second McLaren debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign . The Spaniard was in good spirits as he addressed the media in Sepang after being declared fit to race . The two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error, or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall (even though he was changing gears, he may have been semi-conscious as he did so). It appears he did not mention any steering problem to McLaren until last week - three weeks after the accident. They then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on Monday, perhaps to appease him. What they did not expect was Alonso to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the Sepang paddock. That left McLaren snookered. They could not disregard their meticulous data, nor could they publicly argue with their \u00a325million-a-year driver - relations between the team and Alonso still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at McLaren in 2007. Alonso barely speaks to Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman. His relationship with the de facto team principal Eric Boullier, who was not at McLaren during Alonso\u2019s first spell there, is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to Andrea Stella, an Italian who moved with him from Ferrari to remain his race engineer. These scenes echoed 2007, when Alonso threatened to report incriminating evidence about Dennis to the FIA during the Spygate scandal. Alonso arrives in the Sepang paddock for the Malaysian Grand Prix; the second round of the championship . The double world champion in the paddock with compatriot Carlos Sainz prior to Thursday's media briefing . Back then, the team were split in two. Alonso and his manager Luis Garcia Abad would brief Spanish journalists in one corner. The same procedure happened at the team\u2019s hospitality area here on Thursday. Alonso was again surrounded by his cabal - Abad and his deputy Alberto Fernandez, and physiotherapist Edoardo Bendinelli - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so-called \u2018boys\u2019 lunch\u2019 ... the meal provided for the team\u2019s mechanics and engineers. By this point, Alonso, who arrived at the track at 9.45am, had been cleared by the FIA\u2019s doctors to compete on Sunday, a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three Cambridge University doctors at the weekend. Yet still the mystery goes on. Alonso said he was \u2018perfectly conscious at the time\u2019 of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with McLaren\u2019s public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene. Alonso insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on Friday . Alonso smiles in his car in the garage at Sepang, home of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix . \u2018I lost consciousness in the ambulance or in the clinic at the circuit but the doctors said this is normal because of the medication they gave me for the helicopter transfer and the checks they did in hospital,\u2019 he said. \u2018There is a time I don\u2019t remember from two o\u2019clock to six o\u2019clock, but that was normal on the medication.\u2019 Alonso more plausibly denied reports originating in Spain that he woke up believing himself to be a teenage go-karter. He said he could remember everything the following day, but then said it took him \u2018three or four days\u2019 to gather his memory. Baffling. But not for his team-mate Jenson Button, who said: \u2018I\u2019ve seen every single bit of data many times. Nothing has changed. It all says that the car is OK.\u2019 It was Button\u2019s polite way of saying what we were all thinking about the confused nature of Alonso\u2019s testimony.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nalonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

But the newlyweds also decided to keep their original wedding date in hopes that Brittney would be able to celebrate with her family and friends one last time - and she did. True love: Brittney Ross Brewer, 28, from Windham, Maine, celebrated her wedding to\u00a0Jared Brewer, 31, during their reception last Friday - nearly a year after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer . Perfect pair: Brittney and Jared shared a kiss at their celebration. Only days later the beautiful bride died surrounded by her loved ones . But just two days after their reception, Brittney died surrounded by her loved ones who had gathered to watch her wedding video with her. 'She still wanted to have a big party to celebrate life and see everybody for probably the last time, unfortunately,' Jared told People of their wedding, which was attended by nearly 200 guests. A photographer captured the couple's entire celebration, including their tender kisses and the moments Brittney spent with her family as she got ready. For her special day, Brittney wore a white gown and cowboy boots, while her bridesmaids surprised her by performing a line dance they had learned. Jared's sister Janessa Brewer shared the sad news of Brittney's passing on Facebook yesterday. Family ties: Janessa Brewer gave her brother and her new sister-in-law a loving look at the reception . Full of fight: The couple officially married on February 14, but kept their original wedding date in hopes that Brittney would be able to celebrate with the nearly 200 guests she had invited to their party . Bittersweet: Jared helped Brittney cut their cake during their wedding celebration . Tender moment: Jared wrapped his arms around his new wife, who wore a white lace dress and cowboy boots to their reception . 'While Brittney may not have won her battle with cancer, she will live on forever within our hearts!' she wrote. 'Jared was able to give her the wedding of her dreams and she enjoyed every minute of it! Brittney was a living, breathing angel... who now has her wings!' Brittney and Jared, who met while working for the Corrections Department in Portland, started dating in April 2012. Jared proposed to her on June 28, 2014, a month after she was diagnosed with cancer. 'The cancer only opened our eyes to how short life can be and how we shouldn\u2019t waste any moments,' Brittney wrote on her blog. 'So we decided not to.' Beautiful bride: Brittney posed for the camera after she checked her makeup before her wedding . Special day: Brittney smiled with her relatives before her wedding celebration last Friday . Unforgettable memories: Brittney shared an emotional moment with one of her relatives who held her hand while she laid on the couch . Surrounded by love: Brittney smiled as her friends and family posed in front of her . She continued: 'He pulled out the most perfect and beautiful ring, asked me to marry him, and I said: \"Yes.\"' They planned on getting married this August in hopes that she would be in remission, but after learning that her cancer had spread to her liver, they brought their wedding date forward to February. Friends and family donated their time and money to assure Brittney and Jared would have as much time together as they could. Even members of the local police and fire departments offered her their sick time so that Brittney could continue to get paid for another year-and-a-half, while one of Jared's co-worker sold t-shirts to help raise them money. Saying I do: Brittney and Jared kissed during their official ceremony\u00a0on Valentine's Day in the chapel at the Maine Medical Center where she was being treated . Normal couple: Brittney and Jared, who started dating in April 2012, enjoyed a night out together after their engagement . Happy times: Brittney shared this selfie on her Facebook page a month before she was diagnosed with cancer . Janessa even created a GoFundMe page to pay for Brittney's medical expenses, which has reached $7,000 of her $10,000 goal. And people continue to donate to the page following the news of her death. After her February 14 wedding ceremony, Brittney shared her gratitude for her family and friends on her blog. 'It\u2019s been such a true blessing these past few days to see my friends and family coming together this past week for me...' she wrote. 'Making sure I got to marry my best friend and spend time with everyone I can.' 'Makes a girl appreciate how truly loved she is,' she added. Unfortunately not everyone wins their battle with cancer... Brittney put up one hell of a fight but this disease was aggressive and rare. The doctors were nothing but exceptional when it came to fighting back... They did everything in their power to stop the progression of her cancer... But God wanted her in the worst way. The disease overpowered her body to the point of fatality. 10 months is all the time the cancer allowed her to have.. These 10 months have had their share of ups and downs but Brittney never let anyone see her pain. She was always the most upbeat and positive person. While Brittney may not have won her battle with cancer, she will live on forever within our hearts! Jared was able to give her the wedding of her dreams and she enjoyed every minute of it! Brittney was a living, breathing angel... who now has her wings! We love you sweet girl!

Detectives are hunting for the attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl last Friday. Officers described the footage as 'harrowing', but released it in an effort to identify the attacker, who struck at a bus stop on the outskirts of Leeds in the Beeston area of the city. The attacker drags the young 18-year-old girl from the bus stop into the front garden to begin his attack . The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to \u00a0pummel her with a large stone . The attacker, is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and is in his early 20s, with receding black hair. He is of slim build. The footage shows the man drag the girl onto an area of grass behind the busy bus stop. Detectives believe that several motorists passed the scene during the attack and fear that the man will strike again if not caught. Officers said the man hit the defenceless girl with a large stone to subdue her before subjecting her to a serious sexual assault. The unidentified man then left his victim for dead. Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.' He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties. If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.' At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot . Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari . The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week . The detective described the footage calling it 'harrowing in nature', but said police hoped its release may jog the memories of anyone in the area when the attack happened at 11.50pm last Friday. 'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop. It is absolutely appalling', he said. 'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead. 'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road. 'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless. 'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released.

'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Google stopped selling the first version of Glass and shut its Explorer program in January, moving the project out of its Google X research lab into a standalone unit. Ivy Ross remained head of the Glass team but Tony Fadell, head of Google's Nest connected home division, now oversees strategy for the project. Cources claim Fadell wants to redesign the headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until 'it's perfect'. 'It is a big and very fundamental platform for Google,' Schmidt told the WSJ. 'We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project, which isn't true. 'Google is about taking risks and there's nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we're ending it.' He said Glass, like Google's self-driving car, is a long-term project. 'That's like saying the self-driving car is a disappointment because it's not driving me around now,' he said. 'These things take time.'

Ms Ross still works on the project and runs 'day-to-day' operations. In a statement in January, Mr Fadell said: 'Early Glass efforts have broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike. 'I'm excited to be working with Ivy to provide direction and support as she leads the team and we work together to integrate those learnings into future products.' An unnamed source added Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect.' The previous Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (\u00a3990), and was launched in the US in 2013, and the UK last summer. Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset (pictured) last month.

The firm had already been thought to be developing a new version, with chips made by Intel, to go on sale later this year. Aside from saying it was committed to working on the future of the product, Google gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product. 'It's hard to believe Glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop,' the Glass team said in a post on Google+ last month. 'We kept on it, and when it started to come together, we began the Glass Explorer Program as a kind of 'open beta' to hear what people had to say.' 'Glass was in its infancy, and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk. 'Well, we still have some work to do, but now we're ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run.' Google boss Sergey Brin (pictured) was spotted without the high-tech specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event last year.

The catfish has been named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, in Alabama, as Peckoltia greedoi after the fictional alien bounty hunter. The fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil and has large dark eyes, protruding birstles and a sucker mouth. The new species of catfish Peckoltia greedoi (left) has large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty hunter Greedo (right) in that featured briefly at the start of the first installment of the original Star Wars films . Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films. Yoda purpurata - a deep sea worm . Han solo - an extinct species of trilobite found in southern China . Aptostichus sarlaac\u00a0- a species of trapdoor spider . Tetramorium jedi - a Madagascan ant . Darthvaderum - an Australian arboreal mite . Polemistus chewbacca - a wasp . Agathidium vaderi - a species of beetle . He said: 'Chris looked at the specimen and said \"that looks like that guy from Star Wars\". 'After a little prodding, I realised he was talking about Greedo. 'We then knew what the name had to be. 'The Peckoltia greedoi does bear a striking resemblance to Greedo. 'As a seven-year-old kid, I watched Star Wars in the theatre and it was a life-changing experience for me. 'I became a lifelong fan, and I now share that with my son. 'Greedo has always been a personal favourite of mine.' Greedo, a bug-eyed green alien from the spaceport Mos Espa, was killed by Han Solo in a brief scene close to the start of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It is not the first new species to be named after characters from the Star Wars films. Even though taxonomy is considered to be a serious business, those naming new species often have a lot of fun with the names. In 2012 marine biologists named a purple deep sea worm Yoda purpurata after the Jedi knight from Star Wars - Yoda. Professor Jonathan Armbruster (pictured above on the right with student Carrie Allison left) named the new species of catfish after his favourite character from the Star Wars films that he watched as a young boy . Peckoltia greedoi (shown above) has bug-eyes, bristles on its cheeks and a large sucker mouth . There is also a small parasite that lives on a burrowing crab known as Albunione yoda. A fossil trilobite which was found to belong to a new genus was given the name Han solo by a palaeobiologist Samuel Turvey. Jason Bong, director of the Auburn University Museum of Natural Hisotry also named a new species of trapdoor spider the Aptostichus sarlaac, after the sarlacc monster that appears in the Return of the Jedi. A species of ant in Madagascar is called Tetramorium jedi, while an entire genus of mite in Australia is called Darthvaderum. There are also three species of wasp called Polemistus chewbacca, Polemistus vaderi and Polemistus yoda. Professor Armbuster himself has named more than 40 new species of fish. Peckoltia greedoi was first discovered in 1998 but had not been described as a new species until this year. Two other new species - Peckoltia ephippiata and Peckoltia lujani - were found alongside it. He said: 'In biology, taxonomy is probably the most important science. 'We have not even completed cataloging all of the species found locally, and in places like South America, it sometimes feels like we have barely started. 'We need names to be able to discuss anything about the biology of the organisms, and it is the one branch of biology used by every biologist alive.'

Former defence chief Lord Bramall today dismissed any suggestion of his involvement in child abuse as 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. The ex-Chief of Defence Staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his home in Surrey. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland have also raided the homes of Tory grandee Leon Brittan and former MP Harvey Proctor. Operation Midland is investigating claims boys senior members of the Establishment abused young men and boys in London and the south of England in the 1970s and 1980s. It includes claims that sex parties involving boys below the age of consent were held at the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment block near the Houses of Parliament. The operation includes detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command. It is also examining allegations three young men were murdered, . At 91, Lord Bramall \u2013 the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry \u2013 is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Officers from Operation Midland searched his home last Wednesday. He told the BBC: 'Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated. It is not in my character or my psyche.' He said: 'I know I have only had sex with someone other than my own sex.' He added that any suggestion he was involved in child abuse was 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. He said he had been to events at Dolphin Square 'four or fives times' but only once went into an\u00a0apartment\u00a0there. He has not been arrested, named as a suspect by police or questioned. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer \u2013 and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords \u2013 opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'. Harvey Proctor insisted he was a 'discreet' man and had never been part of 'any rent boy ring' with Cabinet ministers, MPs or military top brass . The search of Lord Bramall's home took place on the same day as officers searched the Leicestershire home of ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, 68, prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing. Proctor, whose Parliamentary career ended in a rent boy 'spanking' scandal, said he was trapped in a 'Kafka-esque fantasy'. More than 1,000 people have been questioned by police investigating claims of historic sex abuse. The huge number, including suspects, victims and witnesses, lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources. But he pledged to get to the heart of the claims, no matter who was involved. Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Bernard said his staff were 'determinedly working their way through' all the evidence, adding: 'We've now interviewed at least 1,000 people.' Asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified, he said victims deserve answers. 'What we cannot do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago,' he said. Sir Bernard added that police 'have to prioritise' but nevertheless have 'put tens of officers into these inquiries'. He said: 'We have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds. They are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago. 'But we will get to the bottom of it, I am sure we will, so far as it is possible.'

There were not many clamouring for the 21-year-old to be in the Spurs starting line-up at the start of the season, never mind the national team. Now, though, Kane is one of the most talked about players in the country as his Roy of the Rovers rise continues apace. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has insisted he is fully focused on helping the club progress this season . Kane rounds QPR goalkeeper Robert Green to score his second goal in a 2-1 win on Sunday at Loftus Road . Kane has now scored 26 goals in 41 appearances for Spurs in all competitions so far this season . Saturday's brace in Spurs' 2-1 win at QPR increased his goal tally to 26 in all competitions - a remarkable haul which is likely to earn a first senior call-up this month. Roy Hodgson could not fail but to be impressed by Kane's latest display, but front man is trying not to think about the potential of facing Lithuania or Italy this month. 'I've always said, I've got to keep doing what I am doing,' he said. 'There are still a few more games until the international break and I want to do the best I can for Tottenham Hotspur. 'That's what I am looking to do. I want to get some more wins from until then and, yeah, we'll see what happens. 'Obviously, I've just got to keep doing what I am doing. 'I think any English player playing would love to play for England. It would be a dream but there are a lot of great players in England. 'I just have to keep concentrating and doing the best I can for Spurs. We'll see what happens.' Kane is widely being tipped for a call up to the England team following his impressive form for Spurs . Kane lashes a shot at the QPR goal only for Hoops defender Steven Caulker (left) to get in the way . That determination to continue impressing at club level is certainly helping Spurs get over a disappointing few weeks. The north Londoners' Europa League exit was compounded by defeat to Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final, but they responded impressively with back-to-back victories over Swansea and QPR. 'That is massive,' Kane told Sky Sports. 'That is what we said. 'We had a disappointing couple of weeks, going out of the Europa and obviously losing the final, so we knew we had to get back on it, build a bit of momentum and get as far up in the league as we can. 'We have managed to do that with two very important wins and hopefully we can continue it.' This latest victory moves Tottenham within three points of the top-four, while it leaves QPR deeper in the mire. The west Londoners have now lost seven of their last eight top-flight matches, with relegation edging closer by the week. Again, though, manager Chris Ramsey defended his players' application and, in particular, Rio Ferdinand. The former England international was culpable for both goals, leading to chants from the away end of 'It's time to retire' - something a smattering of home fans joined in with. 'I think Rio's applied himself well,' Ramsey said. 'I'm very pleased with the way he played. 'In the position we're in, when goals go in people will always get blamed or people look at some more than others. 'For Rio to be the age he is and applying himself the way he is in training and in games, we need to encourage him. 'It's always disappointing when a goal goes in, and you can always break it down and analyse it to its finest points. The players involved will always be disappointed.'

The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by\u00a0Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012. Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas . Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at\u00a0John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, \"That\u2019s not me\" but I had my mum round and she said, \"That is you.\" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson\u2019s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman\u2019s skirt as she stood by her sick friend\u2019s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera \u2013 which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients \u2013 to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women\u2019s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims \u2013 females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month. Theft: The nurse stole this\u00a0Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely. 'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.' It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward. Nurse\u00a0Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004. Her mother and the girl\u2019s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol. The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nvictim, now 38, is one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Her new Netflix series, \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" is being criticized online for dealing in offensive humor and stereotypes. The show, which had been picked up by NBC but ultimately dropped, stars Ellie Kemper (\"Bridesmaids,\" \"The Office\") as an upbeat woman stuck in the 1990s after being kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader: not exactly fodder for humor, on its surface. After she's released from an Indiana bunker, Kimmy moves to New York to start a life, and much of the humor comes from her misunderstanding of the modern world, her seventh-grade education and her relationships with a diverse cast of pals. Since its debut, Buzzfeed has declared that the show has a \"major race problem,\" and others criticized its treatment of an Asian character named Dong. Slate says that the critics \"aren't wrong ... but they are missing the point.\" \"Tina Fey's high-wire act is all about the alchemy of making it OK to laugh at big, heavy issues -- like kidnapped women, the experience of undocumented Vietnamese immigrants, and people with Native American ancestry passing as white -- by skimming over them with a light touch,\" Arthur Chu wrote on Slate. The Daily Dot's Jacqueline Keeler wrote that she once hid her Native American past, just like Kimmy's employer, a wealthy woman played by Jane Krakowski. Keeler said that watching the show made her uncomfortable but at the same time praised Fey's \"genius\" writing. But Tituss Burgess, who plays Kimmy's black gay roommate, Titus (whom some have called a stereotype), says the whole controversy is \"ridiculous.\" He told the Huffington Post, \"I just find it hilarious that people are trying to arrest us for doing the opposite of what everyone thinks we're doing.\" The show is certainly not afraid to go right up to the edge with jokes about race, age, class, gender and sexuality. Consider these biting one-liners and bits of dialogue. 1. \"WHITE WOMEN FOUND; Hispanic woman also found.\" An onscreen news graphic zings the media after Kimmy and her bunker-mates are freed. 2. Julian: \"My first wife ...\" Jacqueline: \"... turned 50. And I would never do that to you.\" Kimmy's wealthy employers, Julian and Jacqueline Voorhees, consider their marital difficulties. 3. \"We came all this way in the great iron sky eagle. I'm kidding. I know what planes are; I was in the Air Force.\" Jacqueline's father, Virgil, explains how he and Jacqueline's mother, both Native Americans, traveled to New York to see their daughter. 4. \"You know Disney lies to little girls. Stepmothers aren't scary, and nannies aren't magical, and dwarves do not let you sleep in their house without expecting something.\" Xanthippe Voorhees, the spoiled teen stepdaughter of Kimmy's wealthy employer, offers up a cynical take on the new nanny's Pollyanna-ish (or emotionally stunted) attitude. 5. \"Well, I had a cellphone, Xan, obvs, but I lost it at the zoo. A monkey took it, and she wouldn't give it back. Yeah, Xan, the monkey was a woman. Women can be anything these days.\" Kimmy was underground as cell phone use exploded -- but she hides that truth from most people, especially the vengeful Xanthippe. 6. \"My dad cannot find out about this, please! He'll kill me! Or marry me off to one of his Saudi friends!\" Xanthippe begs for a break like any teen but gives a glimpse at the life of a 1% adolescent. 7. \"I'm not even gonna know what box to check on the hate crime form.\" Such is the life of Titus, Kimmy's roommate, a gay black man from Mississippi, trying to make an acting career in New York. (Warning: The following video is not suitable for kids, or work.) 8. \"Straight guys can be vegetarians. Hitler was a vegetarian.\" Charles, Kimmy's colleague and potential love interest, defends his diet in the most awkward way. 9. \"Yeah, it's real popular now, like taking pictures of your food or being biracial.\" Cyndee, Kimmy's closest friend from her days in the bunker, offers swift commentary on how the world has changed in the 15 years she was away. 10. Kimmy: \"Dong is the name of the Vietnamese guy in my class. He's good at math.\" Titus: \"That's racist!\" Kimmy: \"But he is good at math.\" Titus: \"I don't make the rules.\" Kimmy and Titus have a conversation about race, as if over cups of Starbucks coffee. 11. Lillian: \"I will not bury another beautiful black man. You know my dear husband Roland was killed in our very own apartment.\" Titus: \"Yes, I've heard this story before.\" Lillian: \"He got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and on his way back to bed, he was shot in the face.\" Titus: \"By you, Lillian.\" Lillian: \"Well, it was dark out, and a black guy was trying to get in bed with me. It was the '70s!\" Lillian, Kimmy and Titus' loony landlord, schools her young tenants on race relations of past and present.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ntina fey's follow-up to 30 rock is getting a lot of attention.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far \u2014 and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship \u2014 Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . \u2018Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\u2019 said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. \u2018Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. \u2018At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. \u2018We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.\u2019 Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker\u00a0Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England\u2019s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster\u2019s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England\u2019s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: \u2018We don\u2019t control it. It\u2019s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.\u2019 England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . England practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle . Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship\u2019s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born. His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England\u2019s chances, despite Saturday\u2019s missed opportunities. Captain Chris Robshaw knows his side face a tough test against the French if they want to claim a crucial win . England duo Richard Wigglesworth (left) and Robshaw will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy . \u2018It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,\u2019 he said. \u2018We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress. \u2018We\u2019re happy with what we have created. Now it is just a case of doing the last bit. The easier bit is the finishing. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll work on.

The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. \"Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further,\" the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. \"We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image,\" Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004.

The embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible Six Nations whitewash await on Saturday. Yet, still, some have faith. After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special. The 32-year-old, who has won 60 caps during his nine-year international career, is not one to take a backwards on the field of play. And he insists that, despite results, Vern Cotter's men are heading in the right direction. Scotland lock Jim Hamilton has won 60 caps for his country spanning a nine-year international career . Ireland will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at BT Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon to apply a significant dose of pressure to Championship rivals England before they take on France in the evening kick-off. An onslaught awaits. But the man who Cotter calls his 'great, old warrior' was in no mood to take on the roll of cannon-fodder. And Hamilton, who has already experienced the pain of the wooden spoon in 2007 and 2012, said: 'I understand the results are the most important thing, but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future. 'Having had the experiences I have had playing for Scotland and not having everything going our way and having to brush ourselves off in adversity, something good will come of the time we are going through just now I am sure. 'This squad is in a very good place, more so than in most Six Nations I have been involved in despite the results. On paper, it doesn't look like we've done too well as we haven't won a game, but I think it is fair to say that we are definitely on the up. Hamilton insists Scotland are heading in the right direction under Scotland coach Vern Cotter (above) 'We have some fantastic players coming through. Jonny Gray was just 21 on Saturday. Then you have Adam Ashe, Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Fraser Brown. We are building an unbelievably good squad of players and we are playing some great stuff. 'The biggest frustration is that in the past we have been the could-have, should-have, would-have side. The nearly team. But that will change under Vern Cotter with this group of players, no question. 'I genuinely, genuinely believe in what I am doing and what he is doing otherwise I would not be working as hard as I am to be here and trying to get into the Scotland team. 'Are we better than the wooden spoon this year? Yeah, we probably are. 'If we beat Ireland at the weekend, am I going to be happy with how we did in the Championship? No. I want to win games. I'm here to win Championships. I am here to be part of a Scotland successful team that will come good soon. 'Whether that is with me starting games, on the bench or in the squad helping the great young guys, I am determined to see it through as this team is heading in the right direction under Vern Cotter. Hamilton cites young talent such as 21-year-old lock Jonny Gray as reasons for optimism going forward . 'I will stay here as long as I possibly can to help our fortunes change which they will. I genuinely believe it will happen soon and this team will do very, very well.' Hamilton's optimism is not based in fantasy. Scotland have shown glimpses of what they can do \u2014 and, at times, their play has been a joy to behold. All they have to do now is execute Cotter's game plan without making the silly mistakes that have cost them victory in at least three of their Six Nations matches thus far. 'I genuinely believe winning is a habit we have simply got out off,' said the big second row. 'Having played for Leicester and for Saracens in games where we are not playing that well but go on to win, we got used to winning. It's a habit but losing is, as well. 'We can change that habit against Ireland and although we may go into it off some losses, we have positives to take from them. Young flanker Adam Ashe (right) is another player who has shown plenty of promise in recent games . 'For example, look at the England game when we lost early points but went in at half-time winning 13-10 \u2014 which just shows the maturity in what is a young squad. 'Also we are scoring some really exciting tries with some being fantastic, haven't they? 'It is now all about bringing everything together now into a full 80-minute performance. Can we win the game against Ireland at the weekend with what we've got? Of course we can.

The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug. He has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes. The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug (file image above) Just last month he attended the party\u2019s high-profile donors\u2019 ball, and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of Government policies. But despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him, he has now admitted \u2013 behind closed doors \u2013 to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis. His consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day \u2013 because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much. And remarkably \u2013 despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years \u2013 the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction. However he is not shy about appearing in the public eye. He always seems full of energy when caught on camera, and has been very talkative with journalists. He has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business, putting many details about his life into the public domain. The addict has also spoken out against Labour policies and in favour of the Conservative Government \u2013 including for moves which benefited him financially. Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball attended by David and Samantha Cameron in 2007 (above) The donor refused to comment, however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction, a source close to him said: \u2018There\u2019s a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified. \u2018He is not a well man. He\u2019s trying to sort it out and sort himself out. He definitely doesn't want to talk about it at this stage.\u2019 Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball \u2013 a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich. The most recent ball \u2013 at the Grosvenor House Hotel on exclusive Park Lane \u2013 attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders. Tables for ten at the February event cost up to \u00a315,000 each, while the minimum price for a single ticket was \u00a3500.

Samantha Green, 23, of Woodland made her first court appearance Wednesday. Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig announced the charges against Green who was arrested Saturday in the death of her 20-day-old son Justice Rees. Samantha Green (above in court), whose 20-day-old son was found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child . The charges also include an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her. Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and Green (left) were reported missing . Green, pictured above at court, told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted. Police have said they do not believe her story . 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by\u00a0CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned. Her partner Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fianc\u00e9 [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Her partner Frank Rees (right), who is also Justice's father, is supporting Green (left; right with Rees) Crews looked through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body, which Green said was in the water . Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villase\u00f1or then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough,\u00a0News 10 reported. Villase\u00f1or said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though\u00a0she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. She was then arrested and charged with murder. After her arrest, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto said: 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsamantha green, whose 20-day-old son, was found dead near the sacramento river in northern california.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup. They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them. England coach Peter Moores talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time . Moores finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level . But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job. 'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better. 'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment \u2013 to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament. 'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old b\u00eate noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Pearce, who was in charge of England Under-21s for six years and also took caretaker charge of the senior team following Fabio Capello's resignation, told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek: 'You only really know what it's like to manage when you're in that technical area and you're the manager. 'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both. 'You can't replicate what it's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you. 'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position. 'Gary will get that eventually, but I think he needs, like anybody, to gain the experience, maybe in club football, as a manager and after that probably in international football as well.'

Armani and DSquared2 showcased their AW15 offerings on  Monday and whilst Kendall Jenner was too ill to walk in any shows, there was still plenty to talk about. They had a big act to follow after Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana - the head honchos at Dolce & Gabbana\u00a0kicked the week off with style when they unveiled their collection, Viva la Mamma, in all its glory yesterday. Giorgio Armani unveiled the 'skouser' (right) - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, bold dresses, left, and fringed shawls worn around the waist (left) Is it a soft furnishing or an evening gown? Armani seemed influenced by interiors with this dress . Giorgio Armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what Vogue are dubbing the 'skouser' - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, which were paired with fur jackets and blouses. Elsewhere on the catwalk were the classic tuxedos that Armani does so well, as well as sequin jackets and even more fringed ponchos. He also showcased strapless dresses with ruched bust lines that looked eerily like curtain pelmets or bed skirts. Yet as he celebrates 40 years of his brand this year, Armani proved he's still a byword for mature elegance. Italian heavy hitter Giorgio Armani wore his signature all-black on the catwalk after this AW15 show . But elsewhere, the shows proved that in Milan - more is more. We saw boho vibes on the Burberry catwalk in London. Similarly, Matthew Williamson stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection inspired by the signs of the Zodiac. Following suit, DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos. The tribal prints, which came in every colourway, completely clashed - but with aplomb. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, who head up DSquared2, called on catwalk stalwarts Malaika Firth and Lily Donaldson to showcase their elaborate multi-layered AW15 designs in the Italian city today. The pair appeared to draw on their country's Inuit roots with parkas with huge fur-lined hoods, thong ties and bold tribal prints. These Native American-influenced pieces were teamed with European colonial-era clothes such as culottes with admiral's gold detailing at the hems. DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos . Brit favourite Lily Donaldson walked in the DSquared2 show in Milan on Monday . Models also wore nude body stockings printed with native patterns to evoke body paint or tribal tattoos. But hair and make-up were kept simple with bronzed glowing skin and loose hair. British beauty Lily Donaldson wore a mixture of styles including gold-embossed navy admiral's trousers, Native American feather trim, beaded bag and sandals and a trapper-style fur decoration. Slung over all of that was an enormous ruby and diamond necklace and opulent sapphire and diamond drop earrings. Other looks included Native American blankets worn with cropped jackets and huge necklaces or voluminous white dresses teamed with a masculine admiral's jacket. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, head up DSquared2 and rocked the runway with a tribal-inspired collection . Dolce & Gabbana's show, Viva la Mamma, invited models to walk the runway with their children in Milan . While yesterday Dolce & Gabbana created a memorable show aimed at celebrating motherhood. The flamboyant duo - who are known for drawing on long-held ideas and imagery of Italian womanhood, whether it's the sensual town vamp or a black-clad nonna - sent models on to the catwalk with children as accessories, walking to the beat of Spice Girl's Nineties hit, Mama. There were toddlers and babies all dressed in the Italian house's sumptuous silks and luxurious lace. Called the Viva La Mamma show, other motifs running through the collection were the deep red, almost Gothic, roses (traditionally given on Mother's Day in Italy), vintage brooches, midi dresses, black lace and corsetry. Aimed at celebrating motherhood, models took to the catwalk armed with their own children as accessories . Dresses were dedicated to the mother and came with hand-stitched red roses . The curtains opened to the sight of mothers and their children and the sounds of Spice Girl's iconic hit, Mama . Famous face Karlie Kloss walks the runway at the Dolce & Gabbana show . The slogans 'Amore' and 'Mama' were embroidered or appliqued and some dresses were emblazoned with prints of Madonna and child, others were decorated with childlike Crayola drawings. Models wore their hair back but parted in the centre, in the style of chic 1940s Italian women, and their lips matched the crimson rose embroidery. However, Salvatore Ferragamo's collection had a more restrained Sixties feel with a brown, beige and maroon palette and graphic prints on the catwalk - as well as the dresses. Dresses, skirts and knits were covered in vertical  panels and the geometry theme carried through to most of the looks. Fluid silk dresses were constructed from different coloured tessellated panels, other tunics and skirts were high-necked and severe. Where Dolce & Gabbana was over-the-top and elaborate, Ferragamo was pared-down and minimalist, helping to set the stage for the final day in Italy tomorrow before the focus shifts to Paris Fashion Week.

Many Zoolander fans were overjoyed when the pair stepped out to close the Valentino runway show earlier this month, in the guise of their iconic characters Derek Zoolander and Hansel. But now the comedic duo have taken the unlikely collaboration off the runway in order to pose up for a quirky print campaign, which is believed to have been shot around the same time as the catwalk show. Scroll down for video .

The other creative duo, Valentino designers, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, have really breathed new life into the iconic brand and we've been swooning over their collections for the last few seasons. We've fallen head over heels for their ethereal gowns and been floored by their rainbow bright stripes this season. And one of our favorite prints from the fashion house is this red and white rendered one.

The high-end fashion brand, which is usually known for its beautiful gowns and must-have accessories,  released the pictures from the stars' shoot earlier this week - prompting speculation that the label's designs will actually be featured in the upcoming Zoolander 2 movie. 'Does this mean that Valentino are going to be making the Zoolander 2 clothes? (sic)' on person tweeted, while another added: 'Zoolander and Valentino are the dream team.' But despite the immense popularity of the first Zoolander movie, which was released back in 2001, Ben admitted that he was shocked to see how excited fans were after the pair made their appearance on the Valentino runway. 'I was a little surprised,' the 49-year-old  said about the reaction. 'I mean it's been 15 years since the movie came out so we really didn't know if people remembered or cared, and it was nice to know that there was a little bit of a connection there that people had.' Strike a pose: Ben and Owen have been in Paris for a couple of weeks to promote the sequel to their 2001 comedy Zoolander . Indeed, Ben and Owen's commitment to ensuring they made their Zoolander 2 debut with a bang was admirable. Not only did the pair manage to take some of the spotlight away from a couture fashion house (with its permission, of course) they also did it during one of the world's most respected fashion-focused events, while still earning a round of applause from the fashion community. Ben added however, that he was 'just happy we were able to keep it a surprise and nobody tripped'. 'We thought it would be a fun idea as a way to announce the movie,' he further explained, when asked why they chose Paris Fashion Week to make the announcement. 'We sort of had top three designers or brands that we went to and TJ\u00a0Maxx and Burlington Coat Factory bowed out at the last minute so we went Valentino.' On the catwalk: Ben, and Owen wore specially-designed creations for Valentino's fall/winter 2015/2016 show (pictured) Repeat performance: Derek Zoolander's (left) world was turned upside down when Hansel (right) won the model of the year award in the previous movie (pictured) Ben famously wrote and directed the 2001 movie, which detailed the life of the dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander. The original movie  poked fun at the fashion world and the duo managed to raise the roof when they stepped back into their comic roles at the end of Valentino's real-life autumn-winter women's collection. Ben even recreated the trademark Blue Steel surprised duck-face look of his  Zoolander character for the chuckling photographers gathered at the venue in the gardens in front of the Louvre museum and Eiffel Tower.

The chance to play, captain and manage the club ensured that, for long enough, the love affair was requited. A year ago, though, a long-standing relationship hit the buffers with a rather dull thud. Widely acclaimed for the way he led the club throughout administration and a season of near-certain relegation, the 39-year-old awoke one day having to digest one of the game\u2019s great truths: No one is indispensable. Gary Locke is currently manager at Kilmarnock after leaving his post at Hears last year . Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson last season . Brutally axed as Ann Budge and Craig Levein made way for Robbie Neilson, Locke licked his wounds before returning to Kilmarnock, initially as assistant manager to Allan Johnston. What\u2019s transpired since the parting of the ways has been utterly intriguing for both parties. Neilson\u2019s side romped to the Championship title with seven games to spare to mute anyone still clinging to the notion that they were wrong to dispense with Locke\u2019s services. Yet, in only losing one of seven games since taking the reins from Johnson last month at Rugby Park, Locke, in turn, has underscored his dug-out credentials and then some. Would Hearts have won the Championship title with him still at the helm? We shall never know. But, as he puts the finishing touches to a new long-term deal in Ayrshire this week, the growing feeling among observers is that his former employers were perhaps both right and wrong. \u2018I don\u2019t think I have proven a point to Hearts,\u2019 Locke insisted. \u2018I didn\u2019t feel I had anything to prove. I did a good job there. \u2018It is like any football club. When new people come in, if they have their own ideas and want to change things then that is what they will do. \u2018I am delighted to see them coming straight back up - they have some cracking young players there and it is great to see them do so well. \u2018But my focus now is Kilmarnock. All I want is the best for them. Hopefully, we can finish the season strongly.\u2019 Privately for Locke, the irony of what\u2019s gone on at Tynecastle over the past year or so won\u2019t be so much painful as excruciating. Locke insists his focus is on Kilmarnock and wants to end the season strongly in the Scottish Premiership . Last season, boxed in by administration and a transfer embargo, he played the kids. Fledglings like Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker featured in sides that were routinely thrashed. Some feared for the psychological impact it would have on them but Locke knew what he was doing. To say the experience has stood them in good stead is a huge understatement. Supported by a string of more experienced campaigners, those little boys lost have flourished under Neilson\u2019s tutelage. Might it be said that the club which binned Locke now owe him a huge debt of thanks? \u2018You probably have to ask people at Hearts,\u2019 he added. \u2018I think the young lads certainly learned the hard way. A lot of them had to play when they probably were not ready. \u2018I think that certainly set them up for this season and full credit to them. They have had a fantastic season, they have played some great stuff and scored lots of goals. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve been in touch with couple of them. They didn\u2019t thank me and I didn\u2019t want them to. \u2018I\u2019m just glad to see them doing very well because I knew they all had fantastic potential. \u2018It\u2019s good to see them all fulfilling it.\u2019 A consummate professional all his days, Locke\u2019s dedication to Kilmarnock is now absolute. And yet, when the prospect of returning to Tynecastle next term is put to him, the broad grin on his face says it all. Locke says he is happy to see the youngsters come through in Edinburgh after working with them last year . \u2018It will be strange going back,\u2019 he conceded. \u2018I went back as a Kilmarnock player and all I want now is for Kilmarnock to win games. \u2018You\u2019ve got to be professional. I was very fortunate in life in that the team I grew up supporting, I managed to play for, captain and manage. \u2018There\u2019s not a lot of people who can say that. \u2018But my only focus now is Kilmarnock football club. I\u2019m employed here and I want to very best for them.\u2019 Be that as it may, does what happened in Gorgie getting on a year ago still rankle with him? \u2018Not at all. It\u2019s football,\u2019 Locke insisted. \u2018One of my best mates in the game, Davie Weir, is at Brentford. You see the job he\u2019s done there with Mark Warburton yet they are leaving at the end of the season. Nothing surprises you. \u2018It\u2019s a game that\u2019s great to be involved in but it can be tough, as well. I\u2019m not the type of person that feels sorry for myself. You\u2019ve got to take these things on the chin and move forward. Fortunately for me, I got a great opportunity back here and hopefully I can take it.\u2019 That new contract should be inked by the end of this week and then the building for the future can start in earnest. The 39-year-old manager admits it will be strange facing his former club Hearts next season . Finally, without the yokes of administration and the intentions of new owners, Locke is relishing the chance to lead the Rugby Park side unhindered. Diplomacy prevented him talking openly of his desire to see Kris Boyd assume a playing/coaching role next term but it\u2019s evidently part of Locke\u2019s plans. \u2018Obviously I played with Kris, he\u2019s a friend of mine and possibly because I was sitting beside him at Ibrox on Saturday, someone saw me,\u2019 he said. \u2018He\u2019s very much a Rangers player and his focus is obviously trying to get Rangers back in the top flight. \u2018It\u2019s not for me to speculate on other team\u2019s players as they have a lot of big games ahead. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be right of me to comment on Kris Boyd. I\u2019m not sure how many goals he has scored this season but he has still contributed eight or nine goals. \u2018If we had a striker contributing that, we might be in the top six. I know Boydy well and I\u2019m pretty sure that wherever he ends up next season, he will score goals because that\u2019s what he does.\u2019 The prospect of Boyd returning to Kilmarnock for a third spell will gladden the hearts of the Rugby Park faithful. The striker may have endured a poor season second time around at Rangers but, at 31, still has the capacity to ensure a return to his first club is a successful one. For Locke, too, Rugby Park has largely been a very happy second home. For all his strong Tynecastle links, it was in East Ayrshire that he spent seven years as a player. And, after being cut-adrift by Hearts last summer, it was Killie that offered him a way back into the game. You sense that\u2019s something that will never be forgotten. Locke was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park . \u2018I played at Killie for seven years and I know what they are capable of,\u2019 he added. \u2018The facilities here are fantastic. I spend a lot of time down here and I see what the club is doing in the local community. \u2018There are kids here every single night of the week, which is fantastic to see. Things are really positive. \u2018When I played here there were a lot of Celtic and Rangers strips about the town and now there are lots of Killie ones so that\u2019s encouraging in terms of the future. \u2018Hopefully, we can see a lot of these younger kids coming through like we do at the moment - we have eight academy players in the first team which is great. \u2018The club is moving forward in the right direction and hopefully it can keep moving forward.\u2019 GARY LOCKE was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park. Over 700 children from 16 schools are expected to be involved in this year\u2019s programme across East Ayrshire.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nlocke chats with ryan stevenson.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The student is suing the Davis County School District for $674,000 for emotional damage he says he suffered as a result of the affair, which happened when he was 17, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. His former teacher, 35-year-old Brianne Altice, has been charged with 14 felonies - including rape, sodomy and sex abuse - for allegedly having sexual relationships with three different students. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on \u00a0bail for charges relating to the first two students. Her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars. Not happy: A student who says he had sex with his teacher, Brianne Altice, is now suing the school district. Altice is pictured in court last month after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied . The student who has brought the lawsuit accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claims they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He claims that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. School district spokesman Chris Williams said he was unaware of the lawsuit. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. Locked up: Altice, pictured in court in January, had her bond revoked earlier this year after it emerged she allegedly had sex with a third student while out on bail for having sex with two other students . In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal. Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . Brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in October 2013 to interview her. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' Last month, she requested to drop one of the charges, claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys. But a judge denied the motion.

The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by\u00a0Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012. Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas . Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at\u00a0John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, \"That\u2019s not me\" but I had my mum round and she said, \"That is you.\" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson\u2019s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman\u2019s skirt as she stood by her sick friend\u2019s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera \u2013 which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients \u2013 to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women\u2019s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims \u2013 females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month. Theft: The nurse stole this\u00a0Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely. 'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.' It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward. Nurse\u00a0Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004. Her mother and the girl\u2019s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol. The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nvictim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Catherine Olguin, a spokeswoman for the Boulder County District Attorney's Office, said prosecutors won't bring the charge in the baby's death, but she declined to say why or what charges Dynel Lane, 34, will face. Investigators say Lane lured Michelle Wilkins, 26, to her Longmont home March 18 with an ad on Craigslist offering baby clothes. Inside, police say, Lane attacked Wilkins and extracted her unborn baby girl. Scroll down for video . Dynel Lane (left) \u00a0will not be charged with murder for cutting out the baby of expectant mom Michelle Wilkins (right) Wilkins had gone over to Lane's Longmont, Colorado home (above) on March 18 after responding to a CraigsList ad for baby clothes . Lane's husband found the infant in a bathtub\u00a0and rushed the child to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Wilkins survived the attack and was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. District Attorney Stan Garnett is expected to release more information Friday about the decision not to charge Lane with murder, and the coroner's office is expected to release the findings of an autopsy performed on the baby. The gruesome attack revived the highly-charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being. Even though the baby girl died, legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that Colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide. State legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights, and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014. Advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law. Naomi Garcia, 11, holds a sign in the direction of passing cars during a protest against Dynel Lane . Legal experts say a person can still be charged with homicide for an unborn child's death under existing Colorado law if the baby was alive outside the mother's body and the act that led to its death also occurred there. After rejecting a fetal homicide law in 2013, Colorado legislators did pass a measure that makes it a felony to violently cause the death of a mother's fetus. The maximum punishment under that provision is 32 years in prison. The maximum punishment for homicide in Colorado is the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Lane is expected to be formally charged on Friday.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nlane's husband found the infant in a bathtub and rushed the child to hospital.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Those trying to log on to the site at about 1.30pm today were met with an error screen and an image of the old test card clown after the BBC encountered an internal system failure. It came just days after the so-called 'hactivists' reportedly wrote an open letter stating it would use a digital weapon called a DDoS attack to bring down the site after Jeremy Clarkson's suspension. The error message that visitors to the BBC website were met with for about an hour this afternoon after it experienced an 'internal system failure' The BBC posted this message at 1.25pm on Twitter after the website went down. The Corporation denied hackers had anything to do with it, adding that this can happen when it experiences a high volume of traffic . Staying quiet: The Top Gear star was seen arriving back at his west London home today. He has not spoken publicly about the row other than to write in a column that he would not 'dwell' on the issue . However, the BBC denied that hackers are involved in the incident and put it down to an internal system failure. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The website was down for about an hour but it is all back up and running now. 'It was due to an internal system failure, which can happen when we are experiencing too much traffic or if there is an issue with our servers. 'Some sites were working and some weren't so not everyone trying to access the site was affected.' They added that the error screen, featuring the picture of the test card clown in front of a fire, was protocol when an error of this nature occurs.

Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was fined last week for his part in an exchange with Pakistan paceman Wahab Riaz during a torrid spell of fast, short-pitch bowling that was easily the highlight of the quarterfinal in Adelaide. Faulkner said that exchange was 'all in great spirit,' and he expected more spirited exchanges with a spot in the final at stake at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. 'There's going to be words said and it's going to be a really tough contest,' Faulkner said, adding that there's usually some sledging on the field. 'It's the nature of the game, it's a semi-final.

My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: \"What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?\" And \"Where is Paraguay, anyway?\" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for \"The Missing Bourdain\" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film \"The Limey\" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's \"Parts Unknown\" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me.

Catherine Olguin, a spokeswoman for the Boulder County District Attorney's Office, said prosecutors won't bring the charge in the baby's death, but she declined to say why or what charges Dynel Lane, 34, will face. Investigators say Lane lured Michelle Wilkins, 26, to her Longmont home March 18 with an ad on Craigslist offering baby clothes. Inside, police say, Lane attacked Wilkins and extracted her unborn baby girl. Scroll down for video . Dynel Lane (left) \u00a0will not be charged with murder for cutting out the baby of expectant mom Michelle Wilkins (right) Wilkins had gone over to Lane's Longmont, Colorado home (above) on March 18 after responding to a CraigsList ad for baby clothes . Lane's husband found the infant in a bathtub\u00a0and rushed the child to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Wilkins survived the attack and was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. District Attorney Stan Garnett is expected to release more information Friday about the decision not to charge Lane with murder, and the coroner's office is expected to release the findings of an autopsy performed on the baby. The gruesome attack revived the highly-charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being. Even though the baby girl died, legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that Colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide. State legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights, and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014. Advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law. Naomi Garcia, 11, holds a sign in the direction of passing cars during a protest against Dynel Lane . Legal experts say a person can still be charged with homicide for an unborn child's death under existing Colorado law if the baby was alive outside the mother's body and the act that led to its death also occurred there. After rejecting a fetal homicide law in 2013, Colorado legislators did pass a measure that makes it a felony to violently cause the death of a mother's fetus. The maximum punishment under that provision is 32 years in prison. The maximum punishment for homicide in Colorado is the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole.

They believe someone smashed their heads together as they stood\u00a0outside the Rose and Crown on Newgate Street. Friends Gayle Smart (pictured left) and Joanne Baker (right) were both left with horrific injuries and deep scars above their eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub . But police say they are satisfied no crime has been committed. The women had gone out for drinks in the city centre on Friday night with Ms Baker's boyfriend John Burton, 26, when they ended up at the Rose and Crown. 'We had been in the pub then we went outside then the next thing I remember\u00a0is our heads were banged together,' said Ms Baker. Ms Smart, a waitress, added: 'As far as I can remember I was just\u00a0outside having a cigarette and our heads were just smashed together.'

Ms Baker said: 'I just saw Gayle's face and I was more\u00a0concerned about her. But she was looking at me and asking me\u00a0if I was OK.' Mr Burton ran to a nearby Greggs shop to get tissues to stem\u00a0the women's bleeding and police and paramedics arrived at the scene. Ms Smart,\u00a0who lives in Bensham, Gateshead, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary\u00a0by ambulance, while Ms Baker got a taxi back to her home in North Shields. Mother-of-two Ms Baker (pictured) said she had to tell her daughter her injury was fancy dress because the little girl was so shocked at her appearance . When she arrived home she discovered the true extent of her injuries and went to North\u00a0Tyneside General Hospital. 'When I got home I was really shocked,' Ms Baker said. 'The cut was so deep I\u00a0had to have internal stitches and eight external stitches.' The mother-of-two said: 'When my kids saw it they nearly passed out. I had to tell my daughter it was fancy dress because she was so shocked.'

Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The west side of Lewis is the best place in the country to view the event, and Stornoway Astronomical Society has already received nearly 500 enquiries from people across Britain and Europe wanting to visit the islands for the eclipse. Eclipse viewing glasses have been selling out fast - and guest houses and B&Bs are opening up seasonally early to cope with the tourist demand. Scroll down for video . Visitors to the Isle of Lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse . Friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind 16 years and the best place to witness it is set to be in the Isle of Lewis . The tiny and remote hamlet of Aird Uig on the isle's west coast has been named as the best place in the UK to experience the deepest part of the solar eclipse - and shadow fever is starting to grip the area. Seacroft is Aird Uig's only B&B. Proprietor Sarah Taylor-Gerloch had sold both her spare rooms - but one, costing \u00a375-a-night, was to a couple of Dutch eclipse chasers. 'They have had to unfortunately cancel. He wanted to treat his wife to a surprise 50th birthday experience to watch the eclipse but it turned out there was a clash of birthday surprises. So the room is free,' said Mrs Taylor-Gerloch. Aird Uig is set to be the best place for viewing Friday's solar eclipse - and there are still rooms to rent . The village of Aird Uig has only one B&B, and one couple's cancellation has freed up a room for the eclipse . The Isle of Lewis is als famous for the Callanish prehistoric stone circle whis is said to be over 5000 years old . 'Ironically the other people who have booked did not know about the eclipse until I told them. They were coming for an outdoor break so this is a real bonus for them. 'We have a glorious view all the way to the Butt of Lewis but the eclipse has helped put Aird Uig on the map. It will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists. But it is a long way to come on the off chance. Aird Uig is a village on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Aird Uig is within the parish of Uig. Known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape. Aird Uig is mainly a former Cold War camp, high above sea level, used by the RAF to man a vital communications post. The giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting Aird Uig listed as an official dark skies spot. Richard Leparoux, who runs the small four star hotel Auberge at Carnish in Uig, said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from England - paying \u00a3135-a-night. 'I think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse,' he said. Pupils at Uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons. 'Many of our members have opened up in March especially for the eclipse,' he said. 'We have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok. Cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse. We are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost. 'People coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like Cornwall where people just hopped in a car. 'We have the best view in the UK and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them.' A spokesman for the Western Isles Council added: 'It is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not, in this case.' Aird Uig is a vital communications post, but residents want a community buyout of the military land . The moon will travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth and darkening the skies across Scotland and across Europe in the morning of Friday (20 March). It is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight. The partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will start around 8.30am and will last until about 10.45am. The further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland\u00a0is the place to be on this list . Dr Steve Bell, head of the HM Nautical Almanac Office said: 'The path of totality lies well to the northwest of the UK making landfall over the Faroe Islands and Svalbard as totality moves towards the North Pole. 'The UK will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse. 'The place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the UK is the west coast of the Isle of Lewis close to Aird Uig. 'Here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am. 'Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands.' Stornoway Astronomical Society are staging a special observing session at the 5,000 year old Callanish Stones - thought to have been an ancient observatory. Society president Donny Mackay said it had received a deluge of inquiries about the eclipse and were expecting a large number of visitors. 'The Isle of Lewis is the best location in the UK for viewing the eclipse - marginally better than in Shetland and the Orkney isles. We are hoping the weather will be in our favour on the day,' he said. A team from BBC Breakfast will be broadcasting live from Callanish too. David Warrington, resident astronomer at the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory added: 'It will suddenly get dark for half an hour or so with an eerie false dawn. 'From the Borders upwards you should get this noticeable darkening and the further north you travel the darker it will appear to be as more of the sun will disappear behind the moon.' Birds can be fooled by the sudden darkness and are likely to fly off to find refuge. Experts warned people not to look at the sun for too long and use eclipse glasses or a pinhole viewer.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nvisitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug. He has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes. The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug (file image above) Just last month he attended the party\u2019s high-profile donors\u2019 ball, and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of Government policies. But despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him, he has now admitted \u2013 behind closed doors \u2013 to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis. His consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day \u2013 because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much. And remarkably \u2013 despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years \u2013 the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction. However he is not shy about appearing in the public eye. He always seems full of energy when caught on camera, and has been very talkative with journalists. He has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business, putting many details about his life into the public domain. The addict has also spoken out against Labour policies and in favour of the Conservative Government \u2013 including for moves which benefited him financially. Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball attended by David and Samantha Cameron in 2007 (above) The donor refused to comment, however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction, a source close to him said: \u2018There\u2019s a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified. \u2018He is not a well man. He\u2019s trying to sort it out and sort himself out. He definitely doesn't want to talk about it at this stage.\u2019 Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball \u2013 a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich. The most recent ball \u2013 at the Grosvenor House Hotel on exclusive Park Lane \u2013 attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders. Tables for ten at the February event cost up to \u00a315,000 each, while the minimum price for a single ticket was \u00a3500. Dinner was scheduled to go on for three-and-a-half hours with speeches by Mr Cameron and the Conservative chairman Lord Feldman. Guests could bid to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May, have a cup of tea with Boris Johnson, go for a 10km run with Iain Duncan Smith, or have a week in a luxury chalet in Switzerland. In the final big fundraiser ahead of the general election, \u00a3210,000 was spent on a bronze bust of Margaret Thatcher and \u00a3220,000 was bid for a week-long holiday in a Spanish fortress. One of the paying guests forked out \u00a3110,000 at the auction for a single night\u2019s exclusive use of Annabel\u2019s nightclub. But a major cocaine abuser was also among them, rubbing shoulders not just with hedge fund managers and oil tycoons, but also with major party figures \u2013 including Chief Whip Michael Gove, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

Taylor's influence is now mind blowing - she has\u00a052.8 million Twitter followers and\u00a074.4 million likes on Facebook. Last year, Shake It Off went to No.1 on the iTunes chart in 64 different countries and in January, she sold the four millionth copy of 1989 in the US alone. The new success had coincided with a new Taylor - one who had cut off her long blonde hair into a sophisticated bob, moved to New York and developed a close-knit group of female friends who she frequently hosts dinner parties for at her Tribeca apartment. Perhaps most crucially though, 2014 also marked the year that Taylor Swift was a singleton. Taylor with with the supermodel Cara Delevingne . Taylor with the singer Lorde (left) and Ellie Goulding (right) Since she was 16, Taylor has had a slew of celebrity boyfriends that have all ended in heartbreak. It would be hard not to be aware of her failed romances, given the coverage they have received both in her music and in the news. In her teens, she dated heartthrobs Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas, before moving on to the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer. There was a brief romance with Conor Kennedy before what has now become her most famous relationship - Harry Styles. Taylor Swift with ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas, who she dated in 2008 . Taylor Swift with Taylor Lautner, who she dated in 2009 . But her dalliance with the One Direction star was enough to put Taylor off men and since her break-up with the singer in January 2013, she has focused on living a single life. She told The Telegraph on Saturday: 'The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship - I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are.' 'I used to think it was important to find a boyfriend, but I don't feel that it is now.' In doing this, the tide has turned for Taylor in terms of public opinion - up until last year, many derided the star for being boy crazy and acting like a crazed bunny boiler. The reputation for being a man hunter also unfairly affected people's opinions about her professional success, which has been almost unprecedented for a singer/songwriter of her age. Taylor with Jake Gyllenhaal (left), who she dated in 2010 and Conor Kennedy, who she dated in 2012 . Taylor with Harry Styles in December 2012 in New York . But with 1989, a new Taylor emerged - the songs were no longer about men and more about her relationships with her peers and the public. Shake It Off was a brilliant two fingers up to the 'haters' who had been criticising her for so long simply for having boyfriends. Taylor's move to New York from Nashville also coincided with a chic new style. For the last 12 months, the star has consistently been photographed on the world's best dressed lists and she even holds her own when out partying with her gaggle of supermodel friends like Karlie Kloss.

A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women\u2019s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group ...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba\u2019i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I\u2019m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview . The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won\u2019t have time for other questions. 'Now, it\u2019s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: \u201cYou can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her . Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air . Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I). Her first book Tonight I will Confess has received critical acclaim in literary circles and she is now the host for Bidoun Zaal, where she interviews public figures and discusses issues related to society, politics and religion. London-based Sheik Hani Al-Siba'i is Director of London's Al-Maqreze Centre for Historical Studies Hani Sibai. He has previously claimed that \u2018anyone who is not a Muslim is a criminal\u2019 and is seen as a controversial figure who has often made offensive comments in interviews. Speaking to Al-Jazeera TV on July 8, 2005, the Sheik caused great outrage by saying that the London bombings were a victory: \u2018If Al-Qaeda indeed carried out this act [of the bombings], it is a great victory for it. It rubbed the noses of the world's eight most powerful countries in the mud.\u2019 The row comes as global views on women\u2019s rights face more scrutiny than ever before. Last month, a manifesto - reportedly written by an all-women Islamic State militia - advised that nine is a good age to consider marriage for girls, who should have husbands by 16. It also said women must stay behind closed doors, be veiled and only leave the house in exceptional circumstances. While in India, a documentary caused outrage last week in which convicted rapist Mukesh Singh blamed his victim Jyoti Singh for the attack. The news anchor won support on social media, with many defending her reaction .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nrima karaki was conducting an interview with london-based islamist hani al-seba.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The catfish has been named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, in Alabama, as Peckoltia greedoi after the fictional alien bounty hunter. The fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil and has large dark eyes, protruding birstles and a sucker mouth. The new species of catfish Peckoltia greedoi (left) has large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty hunter Greedo (right) in that featured briefly at the start of the first installment of the original Star Wars films . Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films. Yoda purpurata - a deep sea worm . Han solo - an extinct species of trilobite found in southern China . Aptostichus sarlaac\u00a0- a species of trapdoor spider . Tetramorium jedi - a Madagascan ant . Darthvaderum - an Australian arboreal mite . Polemistus chewbacca - a wasp . Agathidium vaderi - a species of beetle . He said: 'Chris looked at the specimen and said \"that looks like that guy from Star Wars\". 'After a little prodding, I realised he was talking about Greedo. 'We then knew what the name had to be. 'The Peckoltia greedoi does bear a striking resemblance to Greedo. 'As a seven-year-old kid, I watched Star Wars in the theatre and it was a life-changing experience for me. 'I became a lifelong fan, and I now share that with my son. 'Greedo has always been a personal favourite of mine.' Greedo, a bug-eyed green alien from the spaceport Mos Espa, was killed by Han Solo in a brief scene close to the start of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It is not the first new species to be named after characters from the Star Wars films. Even though taxonomy is considered to be a serious business, those naming new species often have a lot of fun with the names. In 2012 marine biologists named a purple deep sea worm Yoda purpurata after the Jedi knight from Star Wars - Yoda. Professor Jonathan Armbruster (pictured above on the right with student Carrie Allison left) named the new species of catfish after his favourite character from the Star Wars films that he watched as a young boy . Peckoltia greedoi (shown above) has bug-eyes, bristles on its cheeks and a large sucker mouth . There is also a small parasite that lives on a burrowing crab known as Albunione yoda. A fossil trilobite which was found to belong to a new genus was given the name Han solo by a palaeobiologist Samuel Turvey. Jason Bong, director of the Auburn University Museum of Natural Hisotry also named a new species of trapdoor spider the Aptostichus sarlaac, after the sarlacc monster that appears in the Return of the Jedi. A species of ant in Madagascar is called Tetramorium jedi, while an entire genus of mite in Australia is called Darthvaderum. There are also three species of wasp called Polemistus chewbacca, Polemistus vaderi and Polemistus yoda. Professor Armbuster himself has named more than 40 new species of fish. Peckoltia greedoi was first discovered in 1998 but had not been described as a new species until this year. Two other new species - Peckoltia ephippiata and Peckoltia lujani - were found alongside it. He said: 'In biology, taxonomy is probably the most important science. 'We have not even completed cataloging all of the species found locally, and in places like South America, it sometimes feels like we have barely started. 'We need names to be able to discuss anything about the biology of the organisms, and it is the one branch of biology used by every biologist alive.'

In doing so, he has ignored the regimes' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and U.S. national security. This month brought familiar news: more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator Bashar al-Assad against his fellow Syrians. Just in June, the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-Assad's chemical weapons, which had been prompted by his August 2013 sarin attacks on Syrian civilians and the threat of U.S. airstrikes in response. The deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-Assad's chemical weapons arsenal, which he can no longer use to threaten Syrians and Israel or fall into terrorist hands. However, with his actions as evidence, it was a deal that al-Assad likely knew he could manipulate. Even while the deal was underway, al-Assad continued to attack Syrian civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. The deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-Assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. Just weeks after claiming success, the administration quietly acknowledged that al-Assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons. Al-Assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities, as the agreement required. The deal made al-Assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly, mass atrocities he continued to commit. During implementation, the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition. About 50,000 more Syrians were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of Syrians throughout the region continued. Meanwhile, ISIS further exploited the civil war, expanding into security voids. There are several troubling parallels between the administration's deal with al-Assad and the one it is now pursuing with Tehran. Both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally na\u00efve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating. In both cases, the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and al Qaeda -- which these regimes have funded, trained or sheltered. All of this was true before the administration started these negotiations, and it remains true today. Neither Tehran nor al-Assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community. To the contrary, external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-Assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and Tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions. Both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay, obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements. As continues to be the case with al-Assad, Tehran has been emboldened by the administration's approach. It has increased lethal support to al-Assad in Syria, deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in Iraq, and ramped up aid to other militant groups, including the insurgent Houthis in Yemen. These activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that Iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in Iraq and Syria. As was the case with al-Assad, a deal will effectively make Tehran a partner to the administration in which the White House accepts the Iranian regime's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement. And there will still be little confidence that Tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts. Even while negotiations have been underway, Iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology. The regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency's access to others, including its infamous Parchin base. As IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano confirmed again this week, Tehran has still only partially answered one of the IAEA's long-standing, 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities. Amid his continued calls for \"death to America,\" Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal, not as a result of verified observance of a deal. Tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief. Without a complete understanding of Iran's program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a na\u00efve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life. We are seeing it once again in response to the administration's efforts with Iran. As we learned with Syria's al-Assad, making a deal with a terrorist-supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road.

China said Monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits. The schools, in 11 provinces across the country, will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16, the China Daily reported. Successful applicants will receive flight training and \"military standard\" physical training in addition to their regular high-school studies. It's the latest attempt by the People's Liberation Army's air force to attract more talent. Last year, it said it would require wannabe pilots to take psychological assessments and a flight simulation test. China's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power in the pursuit of what President Xi Jinping has called \"balanced strength.\" \"China has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft, but it must make sure there can be sufficient, well-trained pilots to fly them,\" Wang Ya'nan, deputy editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine told The China Daily last month. The recruits will receive a stipend and board at the schools. Traditionally, serving in the military has not been a sought-after career in China and a U.S. report on China's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge. Many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education, while country's one-child policy, which has created the \"little emperor\" phenomenon of spoiled children, produces recruits who \"may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline,\" the report added. To this end, China has been making efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates as it modernizes its armed forces. On completing the three-year program, students will take a pilot selection test, and those who pass will join a PLA flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe latest attempt by the people's air force to attract more talent.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Hush, hush, whisper, whisper. \"They called it the 'C' word, and it didn't get talked about in doctor's offices,\" said Beth Kallmyer of the Alzheimer's Association. \"It certainly wasn't talked about in the general public, it was whispered.\" Today it's Alzheimer's, and 55% of patients and their caregivers say their doctors never told them they have the devastating disease, according to a special report of the Alzheimer's Association released this week. Compare that to one of the big four cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and prostate -- more than 90% said their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis. \"Alzheimer's not being talked about, many doctors are not giving the diagnosis,\" added Kallmyer in a webcast. \"We need to change that. It's a disease, it's nothing to be ashamed about.\" \"This is very current, very well done, and pretty dramatic findings, let's be honest,\" said Dr. Pierre Tariot, director of Banner's Alzheimer's Institute. \"I am reminded of the rather sobering fact that as many as 60% of people who have a dementia die without the dementia having been diagnosed by their doctor.\" Why the silence? This is not the first report to show doctors are sidestepping this tough conversation. But why? That's been studied too, and the reasons doctors give range from diagnostic uncertainty and fear of causing emotional distress to time constraints, lack of support, and stigma. \"There is an element of stigma here towards brain and mental health problems in general,\" said Tariot. \"I would call it professional awkwardness. I can't really help this condition, why invest time and energy talking about it, it makes me squirm.\" \"I think the comparison of Alzheimer's to cancer is appropriate,\" said Dr. Tom Price, Medical Director for Emory University's Geriatric Clinic. \"I give patients a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease many times a week, and every time it is uncomfortable, and I've been doing it for over 10 years. It is easier to talk about cancer now that there are so many new and effective treatment strategies, and cause of optimism with survival from cancer at an all-time high.\" What's at stake . Alzheimer's advocates stress the importance of giving a patient all the facts, as early as possible, so they can work with their family to organize legal and health directives and have time to fulfill life-long desires. It's just as important for the caregiver. \"Imagine it's your spouse,\" said Tariot. \"Personality changes, memory is different, language and communication is different, you don't know what is going on. Then you start getting answers, and you get a sense of how to play to his strengths and minimize his weaknesses. Here are travel tips, communication tips, and safety issues; here are ways to stay happy and joyful, even though this is a new chronic illness.\" There's another critical factor as well: access to clinical trials that might help slow the illness. \"Right now, the big studies that are underway in prevention are really looking at people in the early stages of Alzheimer's,\" said Kallmyer. \"So by waiting, they can lose out on clinical trials as well.\" Addressing the 'gap' \"We want to be clear that we believe physicians are well meaning, but there's a gap there somewhere,\" said Keith Fargo, Director of Scientific Programs for the Alzheimer's Association. \"We saw doctors say lack of time, lack of resources, so we think the answer to this mostly has to do with education and providing more resources.\" Experts CNN spoke to agreed. \"As a field, we have failed,\" Tariot told CNN. \"It isn't just the doctors in the trenches. Medical schools, professional organizations and health care systems have not recognized the importance of identification and management of people with dementia.\" \"I think that medical school curriculum does need to update to include neurodegenerative diseases in their 'giving bad news' training -- Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example,\" said Price. \"We do need to educate all providers to be aware that hesitance to give the diagnosis reduces the ability of the patient and family to make some choices and planning that is essential for emotional and financial well-being.\"\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nalzheimer's, 55% of patients, say their doctors never told them they have the devastating disease.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Without a complete understanding of Iran's program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a na\u00efve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life. We are seeing it once again in response to the administration's efforts with Iran. As we learned with Syria's al-Assad, making a deal with a terrorist-supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road.

Gabby Giffords. The Army veteran died Wednesday morning of pneumonia, according to his wife, Sallie Badger. He was 78 years old. Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived.\u00a0Loughner is serving seven consecutive life terms in prison. Remembered: In this November 8, 2012 file photo, Bill Badger points his hand in the shape of a gun as he describes the events of the day Jared Loughner killed six people and wounded 13 others, following Loughner's sentencing to life in prison at U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona . Shooting: Bill Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. A memorial plaque for the shootings is seen on January 8, 2014 . Giffords, who lives in Tucson, said she was sad to learn of Badger's death. She said in a statement 'I'm so sad to learn that Bill Badger has passed away. Bill was not only a great man and a proud Army veteran, he was a hero. On January 8, 2011, Bill was wounded in the head by a bullet from the gun of my would-be assassin. Not even pausing to realize he had been injured, Bill ran towards the shooter and towards danger so that he could help subdue him until the authorities arrived. I believe that Bill helped save lives that morning. And I will always be grateful to him for his selfless, brave actions. 'My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with Bill's loved ones as they mourn the loss of a great man.' Shooter: Jared Loughman is now serving seven consecutive life terms in prison . Rep. Ron Barber also released a statement, which said in part 'The label \"hero\" an be overused, but Bill was undoubtedly one of the true heroes when a gunman opened fire at the shopping center on January 8, 2011. Although he had been grazed by a bullet and was bleeding from his head, Bill disregarded his own well-being and joined two others to stop the gunman. 'Six people died that day and 13 others of us were wounded \u2014 but the toll would have been much higher had not Bill taken fast action when the gunman paused to reload. I will forever be grateful for his bravery and the lives he saved.' Sallie Badger said it came as no surprise that her husband had risked his life to help others. The retired Army colonel had spent his entire life doing just that, she said. 'Bill was a hero to many, many people long before he became a hero on Jan. 8. He was very influential in many, many young lives in many ways,' Sallie Badger said. She said Badger was highly involved in the life of their 25-year-old son, Christian Badger. Badger also guided young men into the military and other careers, she said. Bill Badger hailed from South Dakota. He joined the National Guard as a high school junior and went on to have a long, distinguished career as an Army pilot for 37 years. The couple moved to Arizona in 1985 when Bill Badger established the Western Army Aviation Training Site in Marana, just outside of Tucson. On January 9, 2011, Badger told\u00a0KOLD 'The shooting stopped and I raised up and didn't realize it, but he was right beside me. Right in front of me. And I got to my feet and one of the individuals who was there to see her was on the other side of the walkway, you know, right where he was walking and that individual took a folding chair, folded it and hit him on the back of the head and he moved his head forward so much of the blunt of it came right on the shoulders of his back and when they did that his left arm came out and it was my opportunity. 'I grabbed his left arm and started to twist it back and grabbed him on the shoulder with my right hand another individual grabbed his right hand and together we pushed on him and he went right down on the sidewalk. 'I had a hold of his throat and the guy on the other side had his knee right on the back of his neck, and every time he would struggle, I would squeeze his throat and the guy would put pressure on the back of his neck.' Badger was not permanently injured from the bullet that grazed the back of his head, but he showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, his wife said. The couple embarked on a three-year journey across the country to push for stricter gun laws. 'We wanted desperately to have background checks on every gun that was sold,' Sallie Badger said. 'And Bill just made that his mission.' Assassination: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is seen in this January 5, 2011 file photo - three days before the shooting took place .

The three-year-old, about 125-pound mountain lion was seen outside of the Macy's at the Promenade Mall in Temecula at about 6am, NBC\u00a0reports. The Riverside County Sheriff's Department contacted the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety, The Los Angeles Times\u00a0reports. The lion died while it was being transported. Mountain Lion: A mountain lion (photographed) that wandered near a southern California shopping center died after being tranquilized by a game warden . Truck: A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety . Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, said that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor . Rare:\u00a0spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being darted, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine . A necropsy will be performed on the mountain lion. A spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being struck with a tranquilizer, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine. 'They tried to do the right thing,' Foy told NBC. 'They have the training and equipment to do the right thing... and it doesn't always work out.' A witness told KTLA\u00a0that the animal was underneath a trailer for about 45 minutes before authorities arrived. The mall wasn't open, and only a few store employees were around in the early hours. But the mountain lion was reportedly first spotted near a freeway. The animal was not aggressive, the LAT Times reports. Officials say the animal could have made his way to the mall area for a number of reasons including simply looking for a suitable habitat.

Many Zoolander fans were overjoyed when the pair stepped out to close the Valentino runway show earlier this month, in the guise of their iconic characters Derek Zoolander and Hansel. But now the comedic duo have taken the unlikely collaboration off the runway in order to pose up for a quirky print campaign, which is believed to have been shot around the same time as the catwalk show. Scroll down for video . Fashionistas: Derek Zoolander (L) and Hansel (R), played by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, took part in a photo shoot for Valentino in front of the Eiffel Tower earlier this month .

Not content with crashing Valentino's Paris Fashion Week show, now models of the moment Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have taken over the fashion house's latest campaign shoots. And we just can't get enough. The other creative duo, Valentino designers, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, have really breathed new life into the iconic brand and we've been swooning over their collections for the last few seasons. We've fallen head over heels for their ethereal gowns and been floored by their rainbow bright stripes this season. And one of our favorite prints from the fashion house is this red and white rendered one. Just a few days we spotted Amanda Seyfried wearing a very similar pussy bow style from the Pre-Fall 2015 line for her stint on the red carpet at the While We're Young premiere in New York.

The high-end fashion brand, which is usually known for its beautiful gowns and must-have accessories,  released the pictures from the stars' shoot earlier this week - prompting speculation that the label's designs will actually be featured in the upcoming Zoolander 2 movie. 'Does this mean that Valentino are going to be making the Zoolander 2 clothes? (sic)' on person tweeted, while another added: 'Zoolander and Valentino are the dream team.' But despite the immense popularity of the first Zoolander movie, which was released back in 2001, Ben admitted that he was shocked to see how excited fans were after the pair made their appearance on the Valentino runway. 'I was a little surprised,' the 49-year-old  said about the reaction. 'I mean it's been 15 years since the movie came out so we really didn't know if people remembered or cared, and it was nice to know that there was a little bit of a connection there that people had.' Strike a pose: Ben and Owen have been in Paris for a couple of weeks to promote the sequel to their 2001 comedy Zoolander . Indeed, Ben and Owen's commitment to ensuring they made their Zoolander 2 debut with a bang was admirable. Not only did the pair manage to take some of the spotlight away from a couture fashion house (with its permission, of course) they also did it during one of the world's most respected fashion-focused events, while still earning a round of applause from the fashion community. Ben added however, that he was 'just happy we were able to keep it a surprise and nobody tripped'. 'We thought it would be a fun idea as a way to announce the movie,' he further explained, when asked why they chose Paris Fashion Week to make the announcement. 'We sort of had top three designers or brands that we went to and TJ\u00a0Maxx and Burlington Coat Factory bowed out at the last minute so we went Valentino.' On the catwalk: Ben, and Owen wore specially-designed creations for Valentino's fall/winter 2015/2016 show (pictured) Repeat performance: Derek Zoolander's (left) world was turned upside down when Hansel (right) won the model of the year award in the previous movie (pictured) Ben famously wrote and directed the 2001 movie, which detailed the life of the dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander. The original movie  poked fun at the fashion world and the duo managed to raise the roof when they stepped back into their comic roles at the end of Valentino's real-life autumn-winter women's collection. Ben even recreated the trademark Blue Steel surprised duck-face look of his  Zoolander character for the chuckling photographers gathered at the venue in the gardens in front of the Louvre museum and Eiffel Tower.

The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct.

The man has stashed the shoes all over his unit, filling up cupboards with the footwear and forming massive piles in corners of his house . Although there were over 1000 pairs of shoes, the man was reportedly only ever seen wearing one pair of shoes. His only explanation to police was that 'he just liked shoes'. 'They were in his kitchen cupboards, under his sinks, they were in the cupboards above the sink,' Leading Senior Constable Baker told The Age. In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom .

Plagad Somian, 23, began hassling Marek Pietrzycka, 45, when she saw him walking with his wife\u00a0Katarzyna in the street in Pattaya, a city on the east coast of Thailand known as a sex tourist hotspot. She reportedly told him to 'ditch the b**** and make the switch' which annoyed Mrs Pietrzycka, 42, who told Somian her husband was not interested before taking his hand and walking off. Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai transvestite jealous over her husband, leaving her bleeding heavily from her head (right) following the assault in the east coast Thai city of Pattaya . Transvestite Plagad Somian, 23, has been arrested over the incident after allegedly flying into a jealous rage . Mrs Pietrzycka is comforted in hospital after the horror attack. She and her husband were trying to walk away . But as the couple tried to leave the brunette sex worker flipped, taking off her shoe and striking Pietrzycka in the face, knocking her to the ground and screaming: 'Don't f***ing mess with me you ugly whore.' Fellow tourist Oliver Kolar, 33, told local TV: 'The ladyboy had been talking to the woman's husband and she obviously didn't like it. 'The blonde started telling the man they were leaving, and the next thing you knew the ladyboy went mental, took off her shoe and smashed it into the woman's face. 'She was swearing a lot and when she attacked, the blonde went down like a tonne of bricks and was lying on the floor with blood streaming down her face. 'The ladyboy then hit her again and that's when the man, who I assumed was her husband, pulled her off.' Police quickly arrived on the scene and arrested Somian, who was being calmed down by fellow transvestites. Local man Son-Ram Wonggoun, 42, said: 'Foreigners are quite vulnerable around here and there have been a few incidents where they have been robbed or ripped off.

The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. \"Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further,\" the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. \"We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image,\" Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004. The elder Lee has been credited with Singapore's remarkable transformation from a colonial trading post to a prosperous financial center.

They say the former prime minister has blood on his hands after sending their sons to war and should be facing an inquiry instead. Mr Blair and his successor Gordon Brown will be among the 2,000-strong congregation at a commemoration service at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Meet the troops: Tony Blair poses with British forces in 2003 after he took the country to war in Iraq . Politicians, royalty, military chiefs and serving soldiers are on the guest list. But fewer than half of the 2,000 places have been given to the families of the 453 war dead \u2013 who are limited to two seats each. Relatives said it was \u2018horrific\u2019 that Mr Blair and Mr Brown should have a place, while many family members of those who died did not. Bob Wright, 68, whose son Corporal Mark Wright was killed in an unmarked minefield in September 2006, said: \u2018He (Tony Blair) is the last person I would want to see. He would have some cheek going. He took the country to war, and cost all of those lives and he\u2019s got blood on his hands.\u2019 Grandmother Joan Humphreys, 70, said it was \u2018horrific\u2019 Mr Blair had been invited but she had not. Explosion: Private\u00a0Kevin Elliott was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2009 at the age of 24 .

Mr Sadler said his 21-year-old son Jack was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007, while Mr Brown was PM.

Mr Blair sent troops to Afghanistan to oust the Taliban and kill Osama Bin Laden following the September 11 attacks in 2001. But the decision sparked widespread condemnation after the war dragged on for 13 years and led to hundreds of British deaths. There was outrage when he sent UK troops to Iraq in 2003. Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in 2007, with the last of Britain\u2019s troops withdrawing from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

The embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible Six Nations whitewash await on Saturday. Yet, still, some have faith. After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special. The 32-year-old, who has won 60 caps during his nine-year international career, is not one to take a backwards on the field of play. And he insists that, despite results, Vern Cotter's men are heading in the right direction. Scotland lock Jim Hamilton has won 60 caps for his country spanning a nine-year international career . Ireland will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at BT Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon to apply a significant dose of pressure to Championship rivals England before they take on France in the evening kick-off. An onslaught awaits. But the man who Cotter calls his 'great, old warrior' was in no mood to take on the roll of cannon-fodder. And Hamilton, who has already experienced the pain of the wooden spoon in 2007 and 2012, said: 'I understand the results are the most important thing, but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future. 'Having had the experiences I have had playing for Scotland and not having everything going our way and having to brush ourselves off in adversity, something good will come of the time we are going through just now I am sure. 'This squad is in a very good place, more so than in most Six Nations I have been involved in despite the results. On paper, it doesn't look like we've done too well as we haven't won a game, but I think it is fair to say that we are definitely on the up. Hamilton insists Scotland are heading in the right direction under Scotland coach Vern Cotter (above) 'We have some fantastic players coming through. Jonny Gray was just 21 on Saturday. Then you have Adam Ashe, Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Fraser Brown. We are building an unbelievably good squad of players and we are playing some great stuff. 'The biggest frustration is that in the past we have been the could-have, should-have, would-have side. The nearly team. But that will change under Vern Cotter with this group of players, no question. 'I genuinely, genuinely believe in what I am doing and what he is doing otherwise I would not be working as hard as I am to be here and trying to get into the Scotland team. 'Are we better than the wooden spoon this year? Yeah, we probably are. 'If we beat Ireland at the weekend, am I going to be happy with how we did in the Championship? No. I want to win games. I'm here to win Championships. I am here to be part of a Scotland successful team that will come good soon. 'Whether that is with me starting games, on the bench or in the squad helping the great young guys, I am determined to see it through as this team is heading in the right direction under Vern Cotter. Hamilton cites young talent such as 21-year-old lock Jonny Gray as reasons for optimism going forward . 'I will stay here as long as I possibly can to help our fortunes change which they will. I genuinely believe it will happen soon and this team will do very, very well.' Hamilton's optimism is not based in fantasy. Scotland have shown glimpses of what they can do \u2014 and, at times, their play has been a joy to behold. All they have to do now is execute Cotter's game plan without making the silly mistakes that have cost them victory in at least three of their Six Nations matches thus far. 'I genuinely believe winning is a habit we have simply got out off,' said the big second row. 'Having played for Leicester and for Saracens in games where we are not playing that well but go on to win, we got used to winning. It's a habit but losing is, as well. 'We can change that habit against Ireland and although we may go into it off some losses, we have positives to take from them. Young flanker Adam Ashe (right) is another player who has shown plenty of promise in recent games . 'For example, look at the England game when we lost early points but went in at half-time winning 13-10 \u2014 which just shows the maturity in what is a young squad. 'Also we are scoring some really exciting tries with some being fantastic, haven't they? 'It is now all about bringing everything together now into a full 80-minute performance. Can we win the game against Ireland at the weekend with what we've got? Of course we can. 'We have shown enough signs that we are good enough and provided we stop making naive mistakes, we can finish the Six Nations with a win and show how well this group of players is progressing.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\njim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of the world.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Martin Freeman, one of Britain\u2019s most bankable Hollywood stars, was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity backer of Labour\u2019s 2015 general election campaign. The millionaire actor, who has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the Hobbit trilogy, was the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insisted Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019. Millionaire actor Martin Freeman (pictured) is the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insists Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019 But last night, the Labour leader faced embarrassment after it emerged that Freeman is a former supporter of Arthur Scargill\u2019s far-left socialist party which openly refused to vote Labour at the 2005 general election. Freeman himself also faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he sends his son to a \u00a312,000-a-year private school. Not only that, but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill \u2013 despite Freeman having an estimated fortune of \u00a310million. In last night\u2019s three-minute broadcast, Freeman, who found fame in the satirical British sitcom The Office, said: \u2018I don\u2019t know about you, but my values are about community, compassion, decency; that\u2019s how I was brought up.\u2019 Freeman with his partner Amanda Abbington (pictured) who declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill, despite living with Freeman, who is worth more than \u00a310million . In an address straight to the camera, the 43-year-old, who also stars in Sherlock, claimed the Tories would take the country on a \u2018rollercoaster of cuts\u2019 while Labour would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few, like me\u2019. The actor also insisted the Tories \u2018don\u2019t believe in the NHS\u2019 and added: \u2018For me, there\u2019s only one choice \u2013 and I choose Labour.\u2019 At first glance, it appeared to represent a much needed boost for Mr Miliband as Freeman is a good deal more famous than some of Labour\u2019s other celebrity backers \u2013 such as Baldrick actor Tony Robinson. But last night it emerged that Mr Freeman spent years supporting a far-left Socialist Labour Party that was set up by the militant miners\u2019 union boss Arthur Scargill in protest at New Labour. In an interview with the Guardian ahead of the 2005 election, Freeman declared that he voted for the party in 2001 and would not back Tony Blair. Asked how he would vote that year, he replied: \u2018Not Labour\u2019. The Socialist Labour Party, which is now almost defunct, campaigns for the \u2018abolition of capitalism\u2019 and the nationalisation of virtually every industry. Freeman faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported he sends his son to a private school . The Conservatives said Freeman\u2019s decision to switch his support to Labour showed how far Mr Miliband had dragged the party to the Left. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: \u2018Even Bilbo Baggins has recognised how far Labour has lurched to the left, imagine the chaos Red Ed would cause across Britain and the Shire.\u2019 Labour was also facing potential embarrassment over revelations about Freeman\u2019s personal life. Despite his socialist outlook, Freeman is reported to send his son to a school which charges up to \u00a312,669 a year. A spokesman for the actor was asked to comment, but did not respond. It was a major coup for Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured) but he faces embarrassment after it emerged Freeman is a former Scargill supporter . The star also hit the headlines two years ago after it emerged his long-term partner Amanda Abbington had declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill, despite living with Freeman, who is worth more than \u00a310million. Miss Abbington, who also appears in Sherlock, had been with Freeman for 11 years at the time. The couple have two children. The revelations sparked an outpouring of bad publicity for the couple, prompting Miss Abbington to settle her debts. She told the Radio Times later in 2013: \u2018It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s being sorted out. It was a big mistake and I\u2019m sorting it out right now. \u2018It\u2019s being paid off now. I would never want to go through this again. But I\u2019m paying it off.\u2019 Freeman\u2019s decision to back Labour appeared to win the enthusiastic backing of Miss Abbington, who posted a message on Twitter saying: \u2018F*** the Tories.\u2019 Labour said the party election broadcast had received \u2018unprecedented\u2019 interest on the internet, with hundreds of thousands of people choosing to watch. The actor appears in front of a plain white background and, despite encouraging voters to put Labour in power, makes no mention of Mr Miliband or the prospect of him becoming the next prime minister. Instead, he focuses on contrasting Labour\u2019s \u2018values\u2019 with those of the Tories, who he claims \u2018have got sod all to offer the young\u2019. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: \u2018Labour is trying to whitewash Ed Miliband from their campaign \u2013 his MPs don\u2019t want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast doesn\u2019t even mention him.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbut his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid tax bill.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Thanks to the European Space Agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft. The amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans, and others that are simply as they originally sounded. The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip. It took off from French Guiana at 9.46pm GMT on Friday 27 March (pictured), carrying two satellites that will expand Europe\u2019s Galileo system . The various noises from space are shared on Esa's\u00a0esaops Soundcloud page. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended. According to Esa they \u2018give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board Huygens would have heard during one minute of the descent through Titan's atmosphere.\u2019 With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn\u2019t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's \u2018water\u2019 is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe (illustrated) as it descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended . Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz. The \u2018music\u2019 was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible. Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko (pictured), as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz . The landing of Philae on the surface of 67P on 12 November 2014 is also heard in a brief clip, which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown. Philae subsequently bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest in an unknown location, wedged under a cliff somewhere in partial darkness. Scientists at Esa are hoping that the probe will wake up in the coming weeks as sunlight recharges its batteries, letting them perform more key science on the surface. Philae's first landing on the surface, seen here as pictured from the Rosetta spacecraft, can be heard in a short clip. The probe then bounced twice before coming to rest in an unknown location .

Samantha Green (above in court), whose 20-day-old son was found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child . The charges also include an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her.

Villase\u00f1or said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though\u00a0she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. She was then arrested and charged with murder.

The man, named only as Saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives. Jihadi John, who was recently unmasked as 26-year-old Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was last seen in a video posted online which appeared to show Japanese hostage Kenji Goto lying dead. Saleh, who worked as a translator, also revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die. ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi who is known as Jihadi John (seen, left, with Japanese hostage Kenji Goto) was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives, claims a defector known as Saleh (right) Face of a killer:\u00a0Saleh, who worked as a translator, revealed that Emwazi (above) routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die . Speaking to told Sky News in broken English from Turkey after fleeing ISIS, Saleh said: 'When he killed Kenji Goto, I live showed this (saw this) but not near, from a little (distance). 'The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say \"put this camera there, change place there\" but John (was) the big boss. 'All time, all time say to all \"fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish\". So respect him. Only he talks orders - others do.' Saleh said the prisoners would be given Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured that they would not be killed. He said: 'He would say to me \"say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. \"We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors\".' Saleh said he explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed. His comments explain why so many of the prisoners appear so calm in the executions videos right up to the point where the knife is placed against their throat. A still photo of  Kenji Goto holding a picture of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh. ISIS defector Saleh revealed how hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends . After Mr Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. Appearing with his face covered, the man added Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. He said: 'Maybe because he use the knife. I cannot understand why he is so strong. 'One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in ISIS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John.' And hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, with their captors telling them they would not be killed as it was a show for the camera, according to Saleh. Murderer: Jihadi John seen (in black mask) leading the execution of a dozen prisoners. Emwazi was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to defector Saleh . Kuwait-born Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities, but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. In e-mail exchanges with a journalist, the University of Westminster computer programming graduate said he considered suicide after coming face to face with what he suspected to be a British spy as he attempted to sell a laptop computer in 2010. Jihadi John rose to notoriety after he first appeared in a video posted online last August, in which he appeared to kill American journalist James Foley. Dressed in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose, and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena.

The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsecond draft law is to go before parliament next month.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

ENGLAND . Why they can win it . I\u2019m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in. George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France. Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster\u2019s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance. Bath fly half George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline this season . England and Wasps flanker James Haskell runs with the ball during training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Stuart Lancaster has been in charge of England for four seasons but has yet to secure a Six Nations title . They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven\u2019t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It\u2019s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there\u2019s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster\u2019s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 \u2014 and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity \u2014 but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi\u2019s absence hasn\u2019t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach\u2019s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster \u2014 compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O\u2019Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe\u2019s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don\u2019t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O\u2019Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach\u2019s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent\u2019s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He\u2019s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach\u2019s strengths? Warren Gatland\u2019s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him \u2014 the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I\u2019d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nstuart lancaster's fourth year in charge are yet to win this competition.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

You're supposed to do a video, of course, and challenge others to do the same for a good cause. The ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on Comedy Central's \"Night of Too Many Stars,\" a fundraiser for autism programs. A tweet from sportscaster Fred Katz challenged the \"Today\" show's Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba, who plays  Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" to share a \"Lady and the Tramp\" licorice. It took off from there.  Next thing you knew, Geist was repeating the stunt with Meredith Vieira and the #TwizzlerChallenge was on. Geist and Vieira challenged Matt Lauer and Kathy Lee Gifford.  They were good sports about it, but you may want to close your eyes here.  This isn't for the faint of heart. The challenge is starting to invade social media.  Just search the hashtag #TwizzlerChallenge. It sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at Twizzlers.  Their candy is on the lips of America. And to their credit, a couple of Twizzlers executives took the challenge and donated $10,000. The money goes to New York Collaborates for Autism.  The group funds and creates schools, programs and services for people with autism nationwide. Since 2006, \"Night of Too Many Stars\" has raised over $22 million.

Armani and DSquared2 showcased their AW15 offerings on  Monday and whilst Kendall Jenner was too ill to walk in any shows, there was still plenty to talk about. They had a big act to follow after Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana - the head honchos at Dolce & Gabbana\u00a0kicked the week off with style when they unveiled their collection, Viva la Mamma, in all its glory yesterday. Giorgio Armani unveiled the 'skouser' (right) - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, bold dresses, left, and fringed shawls worn around the waist (left) Is it a soft furnishing or an evening gown? Armani seemed influenced by interiors with this dress . Giorgio Armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what Vogue are dubbing the 'skouser' - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, which were paired with fur jackets and blouses. Elsewhere on the catwalk were the classic tuxedos that Armani does so well, as well as sequin jackets and even more fringed ponchos. He also showcased strapless dresses with ruched bust lines that looked eerily like curtain pelmets or bed skirts. Yet as he celebrates 40 years of his brand this year, Armani proved he's still a byword for mature elegance. Italian heavy hitter Giorgio Armani wore his signature all-black on the catwalk after this AW15 show . But elsewhere, the shows proved that in Milan - more is more. We saw boho vibes on the Burberry catwalk in London. Similarly, Matthew Williamson stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection inspired by the signs of the Zodiac. Following suit, DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos. The tribal prints, which came in every colourway, completely clashed - but with aplomb. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, who head up DSquared2, called on catwalk stalwarts Malaika Firth and Lily Donaldson to showcase their elaborate multi-layered AW15 designs in the Italian city today. The pair appeared to draw on their country's Inuit roots with parkas with huge fur-lined hoods, thong ties and bold tribal prints. These Native American-influenced pieces were teamed with European colonial-era clothes such as culottes with admiral's gold detailing at the hems. DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos . Brit favourite Lily Donaldson walked in the DSquared2 show in Milan on Monday . Models also wore nude body stockings printed with native patterns to evoke body paint or tribal tattoos. But hair and make-up were kept simple with bronzed glowing skin and loose hair. British beauty Lily Donaldson wore a mixture of styles including gold-embossed navy admiral's trousers, Native American feather trim, beaded bag and sandals and a trapper-style fur decoration. Slung over all of that was an enormous ruby and diamond necklace and opulent sapphire and diamond drop earrings. Other looks included Native American blankets worn with cropped jackets and huge necklaces or voluminous white dresses teamed with a masculine admiral's jacket. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, head up DSquared2 and rocked the runway with a tribal-inspired collection . Dolce & Gabbana's show, Viva la Mamma, invited models to walk the runway with their children in Milan . While yesterday Dolce & Gabbana created a memorable show aimed at celebrating motherhood. The flamboyant duo - who are known for drawing on long-held ideas and imagery of Italian womanhood, whether it's the sensual town vamp or a black-clad nonna - sent models on to the catwalk with children as accessories, walking to the beat of Spice Girl's Nineties hit, Mama. There were toddlers and babies all dressed in the Italian house's sumptuous silks and luxurious lace. Called the Viva La Mamma show, other motifs running through the collection were the deep red, almost Gothic, roses (traditionally given on Mother's Day in Italy), vintage brooches, midi dresses, black lace and corsetry. Aimed at celebrating motherhood, models took to the catwalk armed with their own children as accessories . Dresses were dedicated to the mother and came with hand-stitched red roses . The curtains opened to the sight of mothers and their children and the sounds of Spice Girl's iconic hit, Mama . Famous face Karlie Kloss walks the runway at the Dolce & Gabbana show . The slogans 'Amore' and 'Mama' were embroidered or appliqued and some dresses were emblazoned with prints of Madonna and child, others were decorated with childlike Crayola drawings. Models wore their hair back but parted in the centre, in the style of chic 1940s Italian women, and their lips matched the crimson rose embroidery. However, Salvatore Ferragamo's collection had a more restrained Sixties feel with a brown, beige and maroon palette and graphic prints on the catwalk - as well as the dresses. Dresses, skirts and knits were covered in vertical  panels and the geometry theme carried through to most of the looks. Fluid silk dresses were constructed from different coloured tessellated panels, other tunics and skirts were high-necked and severe. Where Dolce & Gabbana was over-the-top and elaborate, Ferragamo was pared-down and minimalist, helping to set the stage for the final day in Italy tomorrow before the focus shifts to Paris Fashion Week. Salvatore Ferragamo served up graphic designs emblazoned with colourful squares, lines and rectangles .

Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill. To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds. Scroll down for video . A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail.\u00a0Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket . The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes. This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed. Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, R\u00e9union and Mauritius. Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. Lifespan: Two to five years . Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth. The tongue\u2019s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself. In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion. The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved. Previous studies didn\u2019t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said. When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics.

Now, a device called the Crow Box could enable bird watchers to make money from their hobby, as well as watch birds develop new skills. The training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. The Crow Box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. People who want to train crows can follow the open-source instructions to make their own box (pictured left) which includes a perch and funnel to dispense tasty peanuts (right) Research has shown that crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes. The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. So far, the Brooklyn-based maker of the box has managed to train captive crows to retrieve coins in return for peanuts and hopes that wild crows will learn the same tricks. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. It is powered and run by a laptop that can be placed up to 50ft (15 metres) away. Research has shown that crows (stock image) have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes . An experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren\u2019t just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, which the University of Oxford\u2019s Behavioural Ecology Research Group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The device has a perch, a food tray and a funnel, designed to test a crow\u2019s cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks. There are four steps (illustrated) to training crows to find coins, involving peanut rewards . To begin training, the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine, which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it. The machine is then adapted so that it does the same thing when a crow arrives \u2013 training the bird to wait for its reward by visiting the machine. Once visiting crows have learned patience, the machine is changed again so it only dispenses coins and not peanuts. This part of the training is the highest risk, because it seemingly removes the incentive of nuts. But the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray \u2013 which is fitted with sensors \u2013 and into a funnel, peanuts are revealed and the bird's ingenuity is rewarded. This stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food. The training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food. They may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour, or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure. Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The eight-year-old has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life and the BBC. 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. The open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids. \u2018The more people trying different things the faster we'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows,\u2019 hacker and writer Joshua Klein writes on the Crow Box website. \u2018Once we\u2019ve got the system optimised for teaching coin collection we can move to seeing how flexibly they can learn other tasks, like collecting garbage, sorting through discarded electronics, or maybe even search and rescue.\u2019 The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. Some of the inner workings are shown here .

Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat.\u00a0The animal was later released. In another astonishing test set up by BBC Two, a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes.

The 45-year-old replaced Alex McLeish at the helm of the Premier League club in June 2012 but following a poor run of results, which left Villa in the bottom three, the club parted company with the Scot and later appointed Tim Sherwood as his successor. He told BBC's Football Focus: 'I don't have any bad things about Aston Villa. It's a brilliant football club as everybody knows. Paul Lambert says he only has 'good things' to say about Aston Villa despite his sacking in Feburary . Lambert believes Villa are in a healthier position than when he arrived, particularly in terms of their finances . 'I came in at really, probably a tough time and obviously when the financial reports came out, their losses are way down now so from that point of view the club is in probably a lot healthier position than when I went there. 'It's a great club with great people at it, and great people left behind. 'There's things when you look back and think \"maybe I should have done that better or different\" but I've got nothing but good things (to say) about the club.' Since leaving Villa, Lambert has spent time in Germany with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund working towards his UEFA Pro Licence. Lambert has spent time with Borussia Dortmund and Jurgen Klopp working towards his UEFA Pro Licence . Pep Guardiola is another manager in Germany that Lambert has been able to observe at close quarters of late . Although he enjoyed his time overseas and said his time spent there 'was a great experience', Lambert admitted he had no real plans to take up a managerial role abroad at this moment in time and follow the likes of former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes, who is head coach at Real Sociedad. When asked if he fancied managing overseas right now, the former Dortmund midfielder replied: 'Not really, I went over there - I've been back in the country for over a week or so now. 'The two clubs (Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich) there I know very well. Germany's been a big part of my life there but spending that time at Dortmund was a great experience and you learn so much, even though you're only there for that week or so to watch them....it was a great, great experience.' Lambert said he had no desire to follow\u00a0Real Sociedad head coach David Moyes in managing abroad . Lambert praised the work of Klopp and said that working with his Borussia Dortmund side was eye-opening . Sitting and talking with Guardiola was said to be a great experience for the former Aston Villa manager . Lambert praised the work Jurgen Klopp has done at the German club and admitted working and talking with the Dortmund coach and Bayern's Pep Guardiola was eye-opening. He added: '(Guardiola) and Jurgen Klopp are probably the best I've seen working. Just the way they can get the best out of people. 'I think meeting with him (Klopp) and Pep Guardiola was a great experience, to sit with them and talk to them. Defeat by Hull saw Lambert's Villa move into the relegation zone and he was subsequently sacked . Villa have improved under new manager Tim Sherwood but are still not too far off the Premier League drop . 'With Jurgen, I knew Jurgen from the Pro Licence, but to spend nine days with him was excellent. What you see on TV is what he's like as a guy....eccentric probably. He's a top, top guy and they way you see Borussia Dortmund now is probably due to him.' Lambert, who made 44 appearances playing for Dormund from 1996-1997 and helped them win the Champions League, said: 'Even though I'd played there - that was a massive football club - when I went back and watched them it's exploded really, really quickly and Jurgen has been a catalyst of what's happened.'

The Gliese 581d planet has conditions that could support life, and is likely to be a rocky world, twice the size of Earth. Signals from the planet were initially discovered in 2010, but last year dismissed as noise from distant stars. Scroll down for video . Astronomers believe mysterious 'alien signals' - previously dismissed as stellar bursts - are in fact coming from an Earth-like planet. The Gliese 581d planet was initially discovered in 2010 (artist's impression pictured) Now, a further study claims that the 2014 research was based on 'inadequate analyses of the data' and that\u00a0Gliese 581d does exist. The planet was initially discovered in 2010. It was the first Earth-like planet found in the 'Goldilocks'-zone around another star. But soon after the discovery, a group of scientists said the signals thought to be from a planet were in fact simply magnetic bursts from stars. The latest study claims that the stellar bursts research was based on 'inadequate analyses of the data'. They said the method is suitable for large planets, but the technique is unable to find small planets like GJ 581d. Last year, Pennsylvania State University researchers said Gliese 581d - and its companion Gliese 581g - were simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star 22 light-years away. The new British research, however, argues the method used by the Pennsylvania team was only suitable for large planets, and that it could miss small ones like GJ 581d. The study, by Queen Mary University, London and the University of Hertfordshire, claims to use a more accurate model on the existing data. 'The existence (or not) of GJ 581d is significant because it was the first Earth-like planet discovered in the 'Goldilocks'-zone around another star and it is a benchmark case for the Doppler technique,' said lead author, Dr Guillem Anglada-Escud\u00e9. 'There are always discussions among scientists about the ways we interpret data but I'm confident that GJ 581d has been in orbit around Gliese 581 all along. 'In any case, the strength of their statement was way too strong. 'If their way to treat the data had been right, then some planet search projects at several ground-based observatories would need to be significantly revised as they are all aiming to detect even smaller planets. The Gliese 581d planet is likely to be a rocky world, twice the size of Earth. Pictured is an artist's impression of the planetary orbits of the Gliese 581 system compared to those of our own solar system . According to one of Nasa's top planet hunters, we will find a planet with oceans like Earth in the next 15 years. Dr John Mather is an astrophysicist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and the senior project scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The giant telescope will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe, figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed. But perhaps most excitingly, it will study Earth-like worlds beyond our solar system. 'We hope to find a planet that's Earth-like and measure its atmosphere to work out if it has enough water on it to make an ocean,' he said in an interview with . 'I think that will be in around ten to 15 years from now. 'In that time we might be able to say: 'I can see that star over there. [Its planet] has a climate that's like Earth and it might have life on it.' 'One needs to be more careful with these kind of claims' GJ 581d is believed to be the first planet outside our solar system in the Goldilocks zone around its star \u2013 an area not too hot and not too cold for life. To find Gliese 581d, University of California, Santa Cruz astronomers originally looked for subtle changes in light caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet tugging back and forth on the star. The strength of the tugging, they believed, showed them a planet was about three times as massive as Earth. At the time, the discovery of Earth-like planets around Gliese 581 caught the public imagination. Documentary-maker RDF and social-networking site Bebo used a radio telescope in Ukraine to send a powerful focused beam of information - 500 messages from the public in the form of radio waves - to Gliese 581. And the Australian science minister at the time organised 20,000 users of Twitter to send messages towards the distant solar system in the wake of the discoveries. Other exoplanets have previously been doubted, most notably Alpha Centauri Bb, the closest Earth-sized world to us, which some scientists claim could just be noise in the data.

Hussein Javadi took the picture in the window of Hotel Hespiria before he departed for the airport on Tuesday morning, sharing it on his private Instagram account. He had been in the Spanish city to cover 'El Clasico', a football match between Barcelona and Real Madrid - his favourite team, according to his profile on the picture sharing site.

Mr Javadi was killed along with 150 other people when the plane crashed into the Alps . Rescue workers sift through the wreckage of\u00a0Germanwings Airbus A320 which was deliberately flown into the French Alps . Mr Javadi, along with fellow Iranian sports journalist\u00a0Milad Hojatoleslami, were travelling to Austria, where they were due to cover a match between Iran and Chile. But they never reached their destination, as the plane was plunged into the Alps by German pilot Andreas G\u00fcnter Lubitz, killing all 150 people on board the flight to Dussedorf. Mr Javadi's long-time friend Maysam Biz\u00e6r - who shared the picture on his Twitter account after learning of the tragedy - told the Evening Standard: 'He was a kind, loving and caring man with high passion for his work and football.' The heartbreaking picture of Mr Javadi, who worked for Vatan Emrooz newspaper, is just one of the traces left behind of the passengers' final hours. Many of the 16 German schoolchildren, who had been in Barcelona on an exchange, messaged friends and family as they boarded the plane. Among them were 16-year-old Elena Bless, who friends described as a \u2018happy girl\u2019 who dreamed of going to university and travelling the world. Germanwings co-pilot -\u00a028-year-old German Andreas G\u00fcnter Lubitz (above) - deliberately crashed into a mountain to 'destroy the plane', it has been revealed . These are some of the German pupils who died on the Germanwings flight, which crashed in the Alps, killing all 150 passengers. The teenagers had been on a week-long exchange trip to Barcelona and were flying home . \u2018She had been sending me messages on WhatsApp and Snap Chat and had been very happy about the trip. She had had a good time.\u2019 Elena\u2019s best friend and classmate Philippa said. \u2018She sent me pictures of the group together and the different sights they saw. They looked like they had had fun.\u2019 Investigators have since revealed how the 28-year-old pilot locked his captain out of the cockpit in the moments before the aircraft was downed. The chilling final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said Lubitz's sole aim was to 'destroy the plane'. 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit. 'His (Lubitz's) breath was not of somebody who was struggling. He never said a single word. It was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes. Nothing. 'There are alarm systems which indicate to all those on board the proximity of the ground. Then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door. 'The door is reinforced according to international standards. 'Just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact. It's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact. 'There is no distress signal or Mayday signal. No answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower. 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds. 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'He did this for a reason which we don't know why, but we can only deduct that he destroyed this plane. 'We have asked for information from the German investigation on both his profession and personal background. 'There is no reason to suspect a terrorist attack. 'People who commit suicide usually do so alone... I don't call it a suicide.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nhussein javadi took the picture in the window of hotel hespiria.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The search for Noah Thomas, from Dublin, has widened since he was first went missing when his mother decided to get another hour of sleep on Sunday morning. The four-foot, 60lb redheaded child's mother saw the boy at 9am but went back to bed and couldn't find him and saw that the living room door was open when she woke back up around 10am or 10.30am. Noah Thomas, 5, has been missing for two days after last being seen watching cartoons Sunday morning in Dublin, Virginia . Search crews have looked around the boy's house, where his mother saw him at 9am but could not find him after she woke up at 10 . A ground search continued overnight on Sunday and expanded to include more than 100 members of Virginia law enforcement near the boy's home in Pulaski County, according to\u00a0WDBJ. The FBI and Virginia State Police have become involved in the search. Police and more than 100 volunteers who signed up to look for Noah in the small town have covered about 3.3 square miles. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said that authorities have no evidence of foul play in his disappearance. Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. No suspicious vehicles were seen in the area. The boy, who helped drop his mother and infant sibling drop his father off at work at 7am, is believed to be wearing a camouflage jacket, black and yellow paints and Spider-Man boots. He may also be wearing a San Diego Chargers jersey with the number 21 on it. Crews have used helicopters in the search in the area, which is mostly residential with farmland and a woods by the boy's house. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said that authorities and search have found no evidence of foul play in \u00a0disappearance . Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. The boy is believed to be wearing Spider-Man boots and a camouflage jacket when he disappeared . Police say that they are '80 per cent sure' that Noah did not fall into a nearby pond, according to\u00a0WSLS. However, authorities are debating draining the body of water. His mother, who called police at 11am after searching for her child, said that the boy was a cautious child and had no history of running away. Noah's parents were scheduled to make a statement on Monday afternoon, but their statement was delayed. Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Pulaski Sheriff's Office at 540-980-7800 or the Virginia State Police 1-800-822-4453 . More than 100 people in the rural Virginia town signed up to search for the boy on Monday. They plan to continue searching for the boy round-the-clock. Billy Chrimes, deputy search and rescue coordinator with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, said that the best opportunity to find a missing child is often at night when they stop moving. Lack of food and water and potential problems with wildlife are also concerns, he told the Roanoke Times. Temperatures on Monday night were in the mid-40s. Amber Alerts are generally issued when there is a suspected kidnapper that authorities hope to catch.

But six months later, the three-time Olympic gold medalist's office at the Misty May-Treanor Sports Center is empty after a mysterious fallout with her longtime trainer Mike Rangel, who founded the Irvine facility. Now parents are threatening to stop paying their  seasonal dues of $4,300 because their children aren't getting the benefit of May-Treanor's tutelage, as they feel they were promised. Scroll down for video . Olympic gold-medalist Misty May-Treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer Mike Rangel, just six months after he founded a new sports center in her name . Brand new: The 155,000-square-foot Misty May-Treanor Sports Center was opened in November 2014. Parents pay $4,300 to let their children play at the facility for a seven-month season . Boycotts: Some parents at the facility have threatened to stop paying their dues because May-Treanor has not been involved at the facility recently . In a new report by the OC Register, Rangel said he and May-Treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship. Rangel agreed to let Asics sponsor the club, while 37-year-old May-Treanor remains a spokesman for competitor Nike. 'I can respect the fact that she doesn\u2019t want to be photographed with 500 girls that are wearing Asics gear,' Rangel said. However, rumors abound in the club about a deeper-seeded issue that caused May-Treanor's distance, and the scrubbing of all her photos from the club's website. Cary Lambeth, a longtime youth basketball organizer who helped in the early planning stages of the MMTSC believes the break is 'because their visions were not the same'. 'I do not think Misty was doing it for Misty. I think Misty was doing it because she wanted to give back,' Lambeth said. Daily Mail Online reached out to May-Treanor's agent for comment on Tuesday, but did not immediately get a reply. Calls to Mike Rangel were also not returned. May-Treanor's apparent rift with Rangel is surprising considering their previously close relationship. In her 2010 autobiography, she described her relationship with Rangel as 'one of the most important partnerships' in her volleyball career. Rangel helped train May-Treanor between 2002 and 2012, during which she won three gold medals in the Olympics for beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. The split was also swift. May-Treanor attended coaches meetings for the new facility in August, and even gave excited interviews about the club in October. But since then it's been radio silence. Checked out: May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the MMTSC since October. The sports legend pictured on the left with a Laguna Hills High School senior at the facility on October 2 . Legend: It's still unclear what caused the rift between May-Treanor and her longtime trainer Rangel. Rangel trained May-Treanor for 12 years, during which she won three Olympic gold medals in beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. May-Treanor pictured above compting in the London Olympic games . Erased: The club's website now shows now sign of Misty May-Treanor's name or image on the homepage . In October, May-Treanor told the OC Register that the building of the sports center was close to her heart, since she grew up in the area and knew there weren't many places for local kids to play. 'Growing up as a volleyball player around here, I know how gym space had become more and more limited,' May-Treanor said. 'This is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports, too. With the amount of sports and teams we have here, it\u2019s important to have a facility like this.' Brand minded? Rangel says the split with May-Treanor stems from a sponsorship issue. Asics is sponsoring the club, while May-Treanor remains a spokesman for Nike. May-Treanor and Jennings pictured above celebrating their gold medal win at the London games . She also appeared to be interested in interacting with the youth teams that trained at the center. 'I love the coaching and teaching aspect of what we\u2019ll be doing,' May-Treanor said. 'That\u2019s the big part for me, the sharing of information with younger players. And the beauty of this is that I don\u2019t have to be dedicated to one team.' May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the gym since October, a month before it's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office. Last month, about 60 parents with kids at the gym met in a nearby park to discuss action. And in a meeting with Rangel, volleyball mom Michelle Peters threatened to stop paying, saying she felt her 15-year-old daughter wasn't getting the advertised program (parents at the facility pay $4,300 for a seven-month season). 'What aren\u2019t you getting?' Rangel asked during the meeting. 'Well, we\u2019re not getting Misty May,' Peters responded. Rangel says most of the malcontent parents came from a club in Mission Viejo and were not happy when their former club director, who moved to work at the MMTSC, resigned over clashes with him. The 155,000-square-foot facility was pitched to May-Treanor by Rangel ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. Rangel wanted to built a state-of-the-art sports facility, while May-Treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair. The finished facility has 22 volleyball courts, 21 basketball courts - all with their own electric scoreboards. The facility also includes an air-conditioned 350-seat restaurant with 10 large HDTVs as an area to watch the games and practices.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe three-time olympic gold medalist's office is empty after a mysterious fallout.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nYears ago, when our house was always full of small children, I staggered downstairs with a couple of fellow mothers after a chaotic communal bath-time and found the visiting Dads pouring well-earned drinks. We reported that, just before we battened down the hatches, all the three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic and comparing the size of their willies. The mothers all laughed. So did the fathers, for a brief moment, but then, in chorus, they ask\u2122ed: \u2018Um . . . and whose was the . . .?\u2019 Civilized, cultured, happily married men, not a porn-hound or a libertine among them, but they couldn\u2019t help it. Willy-worship, willy-pride, is hard-wired deep in the male brain. However much they deny it, men do seem to care. Actors Jonny Lee Miller (left) and\u00a0Benedict Cumberbatch (right) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark-naked performances as Frankenstein a few years ago . Why else would King\u2019s College London have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure (one hopes not the hard, cold, sharp steel sort) and proudly report that the average length, unstimulated, is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect. I do admire the chaps\u2019 willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler. Brrr. But the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends. And that they all secretly, privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average. The academics explain that it\u2019s all about \u2018using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position\u2019, and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder, and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online. So, don\u2019t tell me men don\u2019t care. Further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing Frankenstein play at the National Theatre a few years ago, in which on alternate nights the role of the Creature, stark-naked during a long opening scene, was taken by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. Conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable, centring on who won that particular contest, and including the immortal line in a theatre-bar argument. \u2018Ah yes, I see what you mean, but is it a show-er or a grower?\u2019 We women edged away, to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being Dr Frankenstein. Libby says she blames author, Jilly Cooper (pictured), for giving men the impression that women are worried about size . Though to be fair, some of the girls were admiring the surrounding abs, pecs, and glutes. We do like a man who looks healthy. It\u2019s a primitive need in the female to bond with a man who is going to be able to take the bins out unaided. But honestly, hand on heart, I suspect that very few of us during early courtship \u2014 or afterwards, or even after the golden wedding \u2014 are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6in average. The idea that we are waiting with a ruler and a scornful frown for the kecks to come off is miles from reality. I blame author Jilly Cooper for giving men that impression, with all her crazed descriptions of things rearing up like the Tower of Pisa, or space shuttles, or \u2014 my least favourite \u2014 a \u2018joyous otter\u2019. I suppose the trouble is that writing sex scenes you have few choices. You can resort to heavy innuendo, or do some Barbara Cartland stuff about being carried away to heaven on wings of bliss. Or you can throw in the towel and pretend the female eye will only be delighted by the spectacle of something that would fit neatly into the London or Manhattan skyline, somewhere between Centrepoint and the Gherkin. Though ideally, of course, not the Shard. The porn industry is obsessed with size, but anyone with half a brain and heart knows porn has little to do with the reality of lovemaking. Most of us have never cared about size. We don\u2019t carry on like the fearsome coven on TV\u2019s Sex And The City, shriekingly comparing notes in the back of taxis or skinny-muffin cafes. It is worth noting, without comment, that much of the genius behind those series and films came from \u2014 ahem \u2014 men. Gay men, in many cases. Out here in the real world, that is not the way women carry on. The only ones I\u2019ve ever known talk about male size were sad, angry girls, unhappy in themselves about their failure to bond happily with any of the possessors of the said tackle. Libby is keen to point out that most women don't carry on like the women in Sex And The City (pictured), comparing detailed notes on the men they know . What we like is much harder to measure. I know a lot of women, and have been one for ages, and it\u2019s simpler than you think. We like hugs, we like tenderness, we like men who seem (often bafflingly) to be delighted and aroused by the very sight of us, even without make-up and a heavy cold. We really like to be laughed into bed and treated with affectionate consideration once we\u2019re there. We like men who think our enjoyment is at least half the point of the exercise, if not a bit more. We approve of chaps, of any dimension, who work out how to make the main event fun all round. We like men who chat and don\u2019t mind being rolled over when they snore or hauled around when they have hogged the duvet. We like faithfulness and kindness, and a man who loves to cuddle the baby even when it\u2019s leaking a bit. And we really like it when they grow out of caring about the 3.6in, or expecting it to be worshipped.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe three and four-year-old boys were snapping at their pyjama elastic.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: \u2018These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it\u2019s all about submission and domination when of course it isn\u2019t. \u2018People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I\u2019m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.\u2019 This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said \u2018it\u2019s worse now, but I\u2019m an old person so I would say that.\u2019 She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that \u2018it\u2019s a huge problem in society.\u2019 Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine\u2019s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society\u2019s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: \u2018There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. They didn\u2019t have sex education, mainly at schools.\u2019 Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers\u2019 \u2018big sister\u2019 imparting advice. This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers\u2019 queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them. Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm . He told the programme: \u2018Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You\u2019re in an odd position, where you\u2019re meddling in strangers\u2019 lives and you\u2019re judging a whole situation by one side, you don\u2019t get the other side. \u2018Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy. \u2018Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don\u2019t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.\u2019 One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes. She said: \u2018There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe mother-of-one said the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This is the multibillion-dollar foundation Hillary Clinton leads alongside ex-President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. What we already know about the foundation's donors is controversial: Some of the corporations, banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of American law. The Clintons can make a plausible case that it's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty. As Bill Clinton recently told reporters: \"You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\" It's an interesting and important debate, and most Americans would probably approve the idea of putting \"bad\" money to good use.  But the argument only works if Clinton's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation's tip-toeing around ethical challenges. To figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the William J. Clinton Foundation shortly after he left office in 2001.  Different initiatives were added over the years to combat AIDS, climate change, poverty and other ills; the most high-profile of these projects, the Clinton Global Initiative, added in 2005, brings world leaders together to tackle the world's problems. To make things even more complicated, the foundation's website says its mission is supported by the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas, which includes an archive of the President's papers. The foundation recently co-sponsored a Black History month event with the center. The foundation's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand. And with 350 employees spread across 180 nations, running the foundation is an expensive proposition: in 2012, the various initiatives spent $214 million according to The New York Times but still ended up $8 million in the red. Who gave, and why, is hard to figure out. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The Clinton Foundation does disclose its donors, which isn't required by law. But the disclosure is limited; dates and exact amount of the donations aren't disclosed. Donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name.\" Hillary and Bill Clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation. During Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state, the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative split off from the larger Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. Hillary Clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the State Department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department's ethics office. It was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title. Ideally that would settle the matter, but there's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that \"at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,\" raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state. In one well-publicized case, Hillary pressed a state-owed Russian airline to buy American planes from Boeing. The effort worked: Boeing ended up with a $3.7 billion contract. (To be sure, secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase American products. It's part of their job.) But weeks after Clinton's persuasion (what she called a \"shameless pitch\"), Boeing donated $900,000 to the foundation. A CNN investigation by Alexandra Jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the Clinton Foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and/or its CGI spinoff as a way to gain favor with the Clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations. In 2012, the British bank Standard Chartered paid $667 million in fines for violating sanctions against Iran and HSBC paid $1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank. Both banks have been major contributors to the foundation. As Jaffe notes, \"the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the foundation placed on its fundraising operation.\" And according to The Washington Post, seven nations donated millions to the foundation during Clinton's time as secretary of state, including a $500,000 gift from Algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the State Department's ethics office. That sort of corner-cutting, and the cozy-seeming connections between Clinton and various corporations and governments, will be tough to explain on the campaign trail. If emails suggest Clinton was aware of the corporations, banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the State Department -- or worse, took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign. It's much too early to count Hillary out, of course. The Clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars' worth of good works, from lowering the price of HIV-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women. But there's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the U.S. government while she was in office. What will matter is not why or how Hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe foundation's donors have been involved in everything from drug money laundering.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: \u2018These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it\u2019s all about submission and domination when of course it isn\u2019t. \u2018People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I\u2019m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.\u2019 This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said \u2018it\u2019s worse now, but I\u2019m an old person so I would say that.\u2019 She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that \u2018it\u2019s a huge problem in society.\u2019 Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine\u2019s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society\u2019s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: \u2018There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. They didn\u2019t have sex education, mainly at schools.\u2019 Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers\u2019 \u2018big sister\u2019 imparting advice. This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers\u2019 queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them. Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm . He told the programme: \u2018Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You\u2019re in an odd position, where you\u2019re meddling in strangers\u2019 lives and you\u2019re judging a whole situation by one side, you don\u2019t get the other side. \u2018Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy. \u2018Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don\u2019t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.\u2019 One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes. She said: \u2018There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe mother-of-one said the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nOh be still my beating heart. Here we are, standing on the gravel outside the library doors at Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire that provides the ravishing setting for the television series, Downton Abbey. We are on the very spot where Matthew Crawley asked Lady Mary to marry him in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, broadcast in 2011. Remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell? When Matthew got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose? For many viewers, this was their all-time favourite Downton scene. Scroll down for video . To the manor married: Lady Carnarvon, the real-life equivalent of Downton Abbey\u2019s Cora, in front of Highclere . \u2018Well, that wasn\u2019t my favourite scene!\u2019 cries the Countess of Carnarvon, the current chatelaine of Highclere and the real-life equivalent of Downton\u2019s Cora, who\u2019s Countess of Grantham. \u2018The crew were using ash to recreate the snow. It got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms. And the smell! Very acrid. We reached the point where we had to stop them doing it.\u2019 Lady Carnarvon has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home. On the plus side, there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic; the crowds paying \u00a320 a head to goggle at the splendour of her Highclere interiors and the red velvet sofas where the Crawleys gather to take tea. \u2018Yes. It\u2019s like that show, Poke Your Nose Through The Keyhole,\u2019 she says. On the downside, damage and disruption. \u2018I do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about, but my husband goes around picking it up. We fill black bags with the stuff.\u2019 And since the very first day of Downton filming, when a technician smashed a much-loved green objet de vertu trinket box, she has been on red alert for transgressions. When she is not telling the crew that she pops open the champagne the minute they leave, she is issuing instructions on the correct way to move precious antique furniture. \u2018You lift a girl in your arms and a chair by its bottom,\u2019 she will say. As Carson the butler (\u2018Oh, I adore him, he is divine\u2019) would no doubt agree, the problem with having high standards is that so few manage to live up to them. Another who has incurred her displeasure is Ralph Lauren. The wealthy American designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at Highclere, hosted by the Earl and Countess. The Laurens committed the social faux pas of taking numerous photographs of themselves grinning cheesily on the famous Oak Staircase, and elsewhere in sumptuous Highclere, then proudly posting the snaps online. Her ladyship was not best pleased. \u2018My interpretation of dinner is having a meal and his interpretation is taking photographs. It seemed to get out of hand. I have to live with that.\u2019 Has she seen the pictures? \u2018No and I don\u2019t want to, because I don\u2019t want to be irritated by them. My idea of a nice evening is having a conversation, not taking snaps. I have never knowingly taken a selfie, I am useless at photography. I am just . . . different, I suppose.\u2019 The Countess of Carnarvon is the equivalent of Downton\u2019s Cora, played by Elizabeth McGovern . To whizz down the mile-long drive to Highclere Castle is to travel back in time to a more gracious age. The stately home made famous by Downton has been the ancestral seat of the Earls of Carnarvon since 1679. Flanked by elegant pines planted from seed three centuries ago, the house sits in a rolling landscape designed by Capability Brown. To look upon the soaring architecture of Highclere is to understand the ambition and conceit of the old English upper classes, who once thought that life behind these ramparts of Bath stone, surrounded by Reynolds, Van Dycks and walls covered in green French silk, would go on for ever. Yet even the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Lord and Lady Grantham in the fictional series is far removed from the realities of today. My dears, in the real Downton, the current chatelaine doesn\u2019t even have a lady\u2019s maid. \u2018Certainly not!\u2019 she says. \u2018And sadly not, because I would absolutely love one.\u2019 In this house, with more than 300 rooms and \u2018about 80\u2019 bedrooms, the servants\u2019 bellboard is still there outside the kitchen, just as it was over 100 years ago. But now, instead of tinkling bells, estate staff are summoned by the crackling walkie-talkie her ladyship carries in her hand. Here, amid her six dogs, her horses, her staff and her husband, Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme. She was Fiona Aitken before she married Geordie Herbert, the Queen\u2019s godson and soon to be eighth Earl of Carnarvon, 16 years ago. Fiona was a foxy blonde and arch Sloane Ranger. The eldest of six sisters, she was raised in Fulham, West London, and is a trained accountant who once designed and sold crushed velvet evening wraps to other Sloanes. Only two years after they married, she and Geordie took over Highclere when the seventh Earl died. \u2018Then you understand that you marry the man and the house,\u2019 she says today. While her husband runs the estate, the jolly, sporty 52-year-old has become the face and force of the real Downton, in charge of monetising the legacy from the popular TV show. In this, she has been enormously successful, writing two best-selling books about previous Carnarvon wives; Almina and Catherine. Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme, much like Dame Maggie's Dowager Countess of Grantham . She also gives talks all over the world. In Texas next month, the socialite Lynn Wyatt is hosting a champagne Highclere Tea where Texan fans of Downton can meet the countess over cake, all for the price of a \u00a3440 ticket. She is quite the draw, happy to take on the ambassadorial role while her husband stays in the background. Right on cue, Lord Carnarvon appears in his Dad jeans and trainers, coffee mug in hand. Seeing that the morning room where we are talking is occupied, he quietly reverses out the door, like a dog in a Crufts obedience trial. \u2018He is very shy,\u2019 his wife explains. No one, least of all the couple themselves, imagined that Downton Abbey would be so successful. Now screened in more than 100 countries, it brings Americans and Chinese visitors here in droves. \u2018Who would have thought an Edwardian drama beginning in 1912 would have such huge appeal?\u2019 she wonders. Who indeed, but shooting began this week on the sixth Downton series. \u2018I am sure they would like to go on making more series,\u2019 she says. ITV director Peter Fincham has told her that he wants Downton to go on for 18 years. \u2018That made me gulp.\u2019 The money that flows into the Highclere coffers as a result of the series must surely, however, cushion the blow of domestic disruption. After all, before Downton hit our screens, the Carnarvons admitted that their estate needed \u00a311.75 million of repairs, including \u00a31.8 million of urgent work on the main house. Although the family will not say how much money they get for the rental of the castle for filming, Lord Carnarvon has since said the show had \u2018taken the pressure off\u2019 them financially. There is also talk of a Hollywood film, which Lady C does not deny. \u2018I try not to lie awake at night worrying about money,\u2019 she says. \u2018Obviously, like everyone else, I have a sense of complete panic every so often. I am not in a position where I have so much money I worry about what to do with it.\u2019 On sleepless nights, she roams the Highclere corridors, and likes to sleep in her son\u2019s bed when he is at boarding school. She soothes herself by listening to the Shipping Forecast on Radio 4, feeling grateful that she is not \u2018alone in a boat on the ocean\u2019. Lady Carnarvon first met her husband at a dinner party where they bonded over a love of World War I poetry. Her former lover, an eccentric cove called Sir Benjy Slade, had sued her for the return of a pet labrador and claimed she was \u2018the ruthless golddigger of the year\u2019. Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire, provides the ravishing setting for Downton Abbey . It\u2019s far more likely that the Carnarvons were two slightly broken people who made each other complete. He had recently separated from his first wife and two young children; she was grieving over the early death of both her parents. They married in February 1999 and had their son Edward in October; a honeymoon baby for a gilded life. It is to her credit that she does all her work on Highclere in the full knowledge that it is her husband\u2018s son, not hers, who will inherit the Carnarvon title and all the lands. Edward gets nothing, but that does not bother her. \u2018I am not worried. If I make some money from books, that is his. In life it is not what you take, it is what you give that matters most.\u2019 She and Geordie appear to have a healthy working partnership, one that she describes as \u201850/50 with a one per cent swing either way.\u2019 They eat breakfast, lunch and dinner together every day and never get tired of each other. Heaven for them is supper on a tray in front of the television. Her transition from confident and capable young woman to countess is fascinating. \u2018I would hate to be considered snobbish,\u2019 she says, although she learned, in the upper class way, to use charm as a weapon to get what she wants. \u2018You could walk into somewhere like Highclere and just stand like a petrified creature in the headlights, doing nothing. Or you could take it one step at a time. It is the end, not the journey, that matters.\u2019 A journey that sometimes takes in some aggravating neighbours along the way. \u2018I am a woman,\u2019 she says, \u2018who knows which battles to fight.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nmatthew crawley asked lady mary to marry him in first downton abbey christmas special.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air. 'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence. 'He fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt. The person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle.' Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children. While he did not apologise to the Eugene Efimov after the kick, he claims he has done so since. But after the video went viral, the youngster's mother Alyona Efimova, 35, was tracked down and she refused to criticise the coach. Left, Valentin Pavlov, the coach who denies kicking\u00a0Eugene Efimov (right) with the intent of hurting him . She said: 'I was at the match and watching the game, and it was just part of the game. The video doesn't show anything really special, my son has been training for football with this coach for three years and we haven't had any problems up until now, and I still don't see a problem.' The video however has underlined a tough attitude that many parents in Russia have to raising children, where violence from parents or teachers is still often regarded as acceptable as a way of making sure they grow up properly. Asked if he was angry at the kick, the boy told local TV: 'No. I am not mad at him, I fell down because I jumped, I didn't feel any pain, it just looked bad.' While the footage has caused outrage in Russia, without a complaint, the Investigative Committee may not take further action. After the boy got back to his feet, Mr Pavlov then appeared to order him back into the game .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nvalentin pavlov claims he was teaching eugene efimov how to kick the ball properly.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The city, which sits in Tornado Alley and sees a large number of the tower's namesake weather events, has been looking for a building to rejuvenate an area that currently holds a part-time garage. Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc, an architecture firm based in Tulsa, was approached by a local magazine to come up with an idea, and has now unveiled the concept for the Tornado Tower, which would hold a severe weather museum and research center. Scroll down for video . Architecture firm Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc have designed a building for downtown Tulsa called the Tornado Tower . Architect Andrew Kinslow told Daily Mail Online that the plan 'has kind of taken on a life of its own' after it was released late last month. Plans for the funnel cloud-shaped tower currently range from 20 to 30 stories, and would multiple floors would feature outdoor terraces. Mr Kinslow said that the garden floors were designed to look like tree debris being carried away by the twister. The building's similarities to its real-life counterpart also include LED lights on the outside that would be spaced to give drivers on a nearby highway the illusion that the structure was spinning. A restaurant on the top floor would also spin counter-clockwise, the direction of tornadoes. Mr Kinslow said that they have been contacted by multiple potential investors interested in finding out more details about the project. The firm says that the reaction has been largely positive and that two Tulsa City Councillors have already voiced support. The funnel cloud building would hold a weather museum, multiples gardens, a revolving restaurant and a research center . While the design of the building may make it look likely to be blown over in the famously strong Oklahoma winds, its creators say the structure would be stable. A solid core would go up the middle of the building with elevators and bathrooms, according to Fox23. The building would also feature a 360-degree rotating restaurant on its top floor, \u00a0and the revolving action seems appropriate given the tower's swirling inspiration. Architects say office space could be easily added and classrooms in its base could help teach visitors about weather safety. 'If you think of St Louis, you think of the Arch. In Seattle, you think of the Space Needle. Tulsa's one of those places where nobody thinks of anything but Indians and dust. And well, maybe tornadoes,' Kinslow said. Tornado Tower, which does not yet have a client to build it, would be held up by a strong core section with elevators. It would be located near the BOK Center (left), a 19,000-seat arena . Tornado Tower would be visible from most of the downtown Tulsa area, and the architect said his team was looking to make 'an elegant looking building'. The state of Oklahoma saw more than 80 tornadoes in 2013, though the number did not reach the 145-tornado record set in 1999, according to the National Weather Service. On top of the tower there would be a terrace designed for reporters to do weather broadcasts. Tulsa's skyline features a number of skyscrapers that would remain taller than the proposed Tornado Tower, including the 52-story Bank of Oklahoma Tower that was designed by the same architects who built the original World Trade Centers. The new tower would be located near BOK Center, the 19,000-seat home of the Tulsa Oilers. Kinslow said that discussions have also been had about moving the prospective building to a different area with more ground space. The weather museum and research center would add another skyscraper to the Tulsa skyline if it is built near the BOK Center (right)\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\narchitect kinslow kinslow said the plan 'has kind of its own'\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The dispute between the party\u2019s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co\u2019 at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics \u2013 as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party\u2019s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: \u2018Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. \u2018We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.\u2019 A Labour spokesman said last night: \u2018There is no truth in this allegation.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ninsiders say the row brought tensions between the contrasting pair.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Hush, hush, whisper, whisper. \"They called it the 'C' word, and it didn't get talked about in doctor's offices,\" said Beth Kallmyer of the Alzheimer's Association. \"It certainly wasn't talked about in the general public, it was whispered.\" Today it's Alzheimer's, and 55% of patients and their caregivers say their doctors never told them they have the devastating disease, according to a special report of the Alzheimer's Association released this week. Compare that to one of the big four cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and prostate -- more than 90% said their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis. \"Alzheimer's not being talked about, many doctors are not giving the diagnosis,\" added Kallmyer in a webcast. \"We need to change that. It's a disease, it's nothing to be ashamed about.\" \"This is very current, very well done, and pretty dramatic findings, let's be honest,\" said Dr. Pierre Tariot, director of Banner's Alzheimer's Institute. \"I am reminded of the rather sobering fact that as many as 60% of people who have a dementia die without the dementia having been diagnosed by their doctor.\" Why the silence? This is not the first report to show doctors are sidestepping this tough conversation. But why? That's been studied too, and the reasons doctors give range from diagnostic uncertainty and fear of causing emotional distress to time constraints, lack of support, and stigma. \"There is an element of stigma here towards brain and mental health problems in general,\" said Tariot. \"I would call it professional awkwardness. I can't really help this condition, why invest time and energy talking about it, it makes me squirm.\" \"I think the comparison of Alzheimer's to cancer is appropriate,\" said Dr. Tom Price, Medical Director for Emory University's Geriatric Clinic. \"I give patients a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease many times a week, and every time it is uncomfortable, and I've been doing it for over 10 years. It is easier to talk about cancer now that there are so many new and effective treatment strategies, and cause of optimism with survival from cancer at an all-time high.\" What's at stake . Alzheimer's advocates stress the importance of giving a patient all the facts, as early as possible, so they can work with their family to organize legal and health directives and have time to fulfill life-long desires. It's just as important for the caregiver. \"Imagine it's your spouse,\" said Tariot. \"Personality changes, memory is different, language and communication is different, you don't know what is going on. Then you start getting answers, and you get a sense of how to play to his strengths and minimize his weaknesses. Here are travel tips, communication tips, and safety issues; here are ways to stay happy and joyful, even though this is a new chronic illness.\" There's another critical factor as well: access to clinical trials that might help slow the illness. \"Right now, the big studies that are underway in prevention are really looking at people in the early stages of Alzheimer's,\" said Kallmyer. \"So by waiting, they can lose out on clinical trials as well.\" Addressing the 'gap' \"We want to be clear that we believe physicians are well meaning, but there's a gap there somewhere,\" said Keith Fargo, Director of Scientific Programs for the Alzheimer's Association. \"We saw doctors say lack of time, lack of resources, so we think the answer to this mostly has to do with education and providing more resources.\" Experts CNN spoke to agreed. \"As a field, we have failed,\" Tariot told CNN. \"It isn't just the doctors in the trenches. Medical schools, professional organizations and health care systems have not recognized the importance of identification and management of people with dementia.\" \"I think that medical school curriculum does need to update to include neurodegenerative diseases in their 'giving bad news' training -- Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example,\" said Price. \"We do need to educate all providers to be aware that hesitance to give the diagnosis reduces the ability of the patient and family to make some choices and planning that is essential for emotional and financial well-being.\"\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nmore than 90% said their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, from Paignton, Devon was stunned to discover a member of the public had reported him to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) - claiming someone that good at darts could not possibly be blind. 'Everything went OK. Then I got a letter from the DWP,' he explained. Scroll down for video .

Mr. Boon, who is registered blind as he is completely blind in one eye and only able to see shadows in the other, said: 'I rang them up because I couldn't read it, and they explained to me that someone had reported me because of the dart marathon. 'There were loads of people there, so it could have been someone at the event. 'I felt humiliated because I don't think it is right to report me when I have tried to do something good. 'I rang the hospital to get my medical records on my eye condition. I don't see why people should put me down. 'I feel really intimidated now.

Mr. Boom organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the \u00a310,000 training of two guide dogs who he wanted to name Mary and Wesley\u00a0after his recently deceased friends. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some accuracy . He scored 61,000 points and a maximum 180 with three darts. He played the game when he was younger . Having played darts for fun before he lost his sight, Robert decided the event was the best way to raise the cash. Throughout the day held at the Pond Coffee Shop in Paignton, Robert racked up 61,000 points and at one point a maximum 180 with three darts. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some degree of accuracy. Mr. Boon stood his ground with the DWP but said he felt humiliated and intimidated by being accused of fraud . Mr. Boon felt the whole episode was unfair, especially considering he was trying to help people like him . He stepped up to the oche at 10am, and was throwing darts all day, with a five minute rest every hour, until nearly 9pm. Robert said: 'I've always had bad eyesight, I was never allowed to drive or even play football. The only sports I was allowed to do was judo or darts. 'Two of my friends passed away recently and I wanted to name guide dogs after them, so that their names could live on. 'I was watching TV a while back and saw a blind darts team, so I decided to give it a go.

In doing so, he has ignored the regimes' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and U.S. national security. This month brought familiar news: more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator Bashar al-Assad against his fellow Syrians. Just in June, the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-Assad's chemical weapons, which had been prompted by his August 2013 sarin attacks on Syrian civilians and the threat of U.S. airstrikes in response. The deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-Assad's chemical weapons arsenal, which he can no longer use to threaten Syrians and Israel or fall into terrorist hands. However, with his actions as evidence, it was a deal that al-Assad likely knew he could manipulate. Even while the deal was underway, al-Assad continued to attack Syrian civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. The deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-Assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. Just weeks after claiming success, the administration quietly acknowledged that al-Assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons. Al-Assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities, as the agreement required. The deal made al-Assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly, mass atrocities he continued to commit. During implementation, the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition. About 50,000 more Syrians were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of Syrians throughout the region continued. Meanwhile, ISIS further exploited the civil war, expanding into security voids. There are several troubling parallels between the administration's deal with al-Assad and the one it is now pursuing with Tehran. Both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally na\u00efve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating. In both cases, the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and al Qaeda -- which these regimes have funded, trained or sheltered. All of this was true before the administration started these negotiations, and it remains true today. Neither Tehran nor al-Assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community. To the contrary, external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-Assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and Tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions. Both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay, obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements. As continues to be the case with al-Assad, Tehran has been emboldened by the administration's approach. It has increased lethal support to al-Assad in Syria, deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in Iraq, and ramped up aid to other militant groups, including the insurgent Houthis in Yemen. These activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that Iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in Iraq and Syria. As was the case with al-Assad, a deal will effectively make Tehran a partner to the administration in which the White House accepts the Iranian regime's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement. And there will still be little confidence that Tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts. Even while negotiations have been underway, Iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology. The regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency's access to others, including its infamous Parchin base. As IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano confirmed again this week, Tehran has still only partially answered one of the IAEA's long-standing, 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities. Amid his continued calls for \"death to America,\" Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal, not as a result of verified observance of a deal. Tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief. Without a complete understanding of Iran's program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a na\u00efve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life. We are seeing it once again in response to the administration's efforts with Iran. As we learned with Syria's al-Assad, making a deal with a terrorist-supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road.

The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsecond draft law is to go before parliament next month.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This is the multibillion-dollar foundation Hillary Clinton leads alongside ex-President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. What we already know about the foundation's donors is controversial: Some of the corporations, banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of American law. The Clintons can make a plausible case that it's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty. As Bill Clinton recently told reporters: \"You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\" It's an interesting and important debate, and most Americans would probably approve the idea of putting \"bad\" money to good use.  But the argument only works if Clinton's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation's tip-toeing around ethical challenges. To figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the William J. Clinton Foundation shortly after he left office in 2001.  Different initiatives were added over the years to combat AIDS, climate change, poverty and other ills; the most high-profile of these projects, the Clinton Global Initiative, added in 2005, brings world leaders together to tackle the world's problems. To make things even more complicated, the foundation's website says its mission is supported by the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas, which includes an archive of the President's papers. The foundation recently co-sponsored a Black History month event with the center. The foundation's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand. And with 350 employees spread across 180 nations, running the foundation is an expensive proposition: in 2012, the various initiatives spent $214 million according to The New York Times but still ended up $8 million in the red. Who gave, and why, is hard to figure out. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The Clinton Foundation does disclose its donors, which isn't required by law. But the disclosure is limited; dates and exact amount of the donations aren't disclosed. Donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name.\" Hillary and Bill Clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation. During Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state, the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative split off from the larger Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. Hillary Clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the State Department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department's ethics office. It was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title. Ideally that would settle the matter, but there's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that \"at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,\" raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state. In one well-publicized case, Hillary pressed a state-owed Russian airline to buy American planes from Boeing. The effort worked: Boeing ended up with a $3.7 billion contract. (To be sure, secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase American products. It's part of their job.) But weeks after Clinton's persuasion (what she called a \"shameless pitch\"), Boeing donated $900,000 to the foundation. A CNN investigation by Alexandra Jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the Clinton Foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and/or its CGI spinoff as a way to gain favor with the Clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations. In 2012, the British bank Standard Chartered paid $667 million in fines for violating sanctions against Iran and HSBC paid $1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank. Both banks have been major contributors to the foundation. As Jaffe notes, \"the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the foundation placed on its fundraising operation.\" And according to The Washington Post, seven nations donated millions to the foundation during Clinton's time as secretary of state, including a $500,000 gift from Algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the State Department's ethics office. That sort of corner-cutting, and the cozy-seeming connections between Clinton and various corporations and governments, will be tough to explain on the campaign trail. If emails suggest Clinton was aware of the corporations, banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the State Department -- or worse, took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign. It's much too early to count Hillary out, of course. The Clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars' worth of good works, from lowering the price of HIV-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women. But there's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the U.S. government while she was in office. What will matter is not why or how Hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nhillary clinton's lawyerly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

But from a very young age, the youngster from Los Angeles knew it simply wasn't the case. The transgender 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two, setting his physical 'parts' aside. Writing for CNN, he has described how he knew he was male long before he discovered the terms 'gay' and 'sexuality', and the difficulty he encountered with other people's perceptions growing up. He also urges parents to let children set out their path - no matter their gender. Avery Wallace (right) poses for a picture with his sister Riley in 2002 at the age of three. He claims he knew he was a boy when he was two . His parents let him cut his hair short for his preschool graduation, even though he was wearing a dress . Describing life as a toddler, he said: 'I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind - not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. 'No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part.' He said he first heard the term 'gay' in second grade, even after he had his first 'girlfriend', and remembered how one year 'a penis' was at the top of his Christmas list. However he feared people may perceive him as 'different' when he learned homosexuality was considered by some to be abnormal. 'I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay - but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.' At the age of seven he started to prefer wearing boys clothes and by eight, he was playing baseball . Avery was elected class president in the fifth grade by his peers. He strongly stated that he was a boy\u00a0and the 'people that mattered knew it too, for the most part' He is pictured at age 10 with short, curly hair. By now he was living the life of a boy, but the word transgender hadn't formed part of his vocabulary . Avery described how he was able to become the boy he wanted, because he grew up in a house that taught him to 'love anyone I wanted to.' 'That said,' he added. 'I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either.' When he entered middle school, he grew out his hair and started to wear dresses as to avoid the 'emotional torture'. But in 2012, when he was 12, he told his parents he was transgender. He is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment after attending a number of group sessions, and has urged people to consider categorizing people into boys and girls more carefully. 'I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight,' Avery said. He added: 'Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was.' Avery wore a suit and lavender waistcoat for his fifth grade graduation, but from then on he grew out his hair and some times wore a dress to avoid the 'emotional torture' of middle school . In 2012 he told his parents he was transgender and is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ndoctors told his mother: 'it's a girl'\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by\u00a0Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012. Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas . Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at\u00a0John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, \"That\u2019s not me\" but I had my mum round and she said, \"That is you.\" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson\u2019s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman\u2019s skirt as she stood by her sick friend\u2019s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera \u2013 which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients \u2013 to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women\u2019s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims \u2013 females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month. Theft: The nurse stole this\u00a0Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely. 'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.' It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward. Nurse\u00a0Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004. Her mother and the girl\u2019s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol. The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nshe was secretly raped in a&e by a male nurse who filmed the attack.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, from Paignton, Devon was stunned to discover a member of the public had reported him to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) - claiming someone that good at darts could not possibly be blind. 'Everything went OK. Then I got a letter from the DWP,' he explained. Scroll down for video . Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, (pictured) from Paignton, Devon organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the \u00a310,000 training of two guide dogs . Mr Boon felt moved to raise the money for charity in memory of his recently deceased friends. A user of a guide dog himself, he knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight . Mr. Boon, who is registered blind as he is completely blind in one eye and only able to see shadows in the other, said: 'I rang them up because I couldn't read it, and they explained to me that someone had reported me because of the dart marathon. 'There were loads of people there, so it could have been someone at the event. 'I felt humiliated because I don't think it is right to report me when I have tried to do something good. 'I rang the hospital to get my medical records on my eye condition. I don't see why people should put me down. 'I feel really intimidated now. I am registered blind and can't see virtually anything out of one eye and shadows in the other. The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits. Mr. Boom organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the \u00a310,000 training of two guide dogs who he wanted to name Mary and Wesley\u00a0after his recently deceased friends. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some accuracy . He scored 61,000 points and a maximum 180 with three darts. He played the game when he was younger . Having played darts for fun before he lost his sight, Robert decided the event was the best way to raise the cash. Throughout the day held at the Pond Coffee Shop in Paignton, Robert racked up 61,000 points and at one point a maximum 180 with three darts. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some degree of accuracy. Mr. Boon stood his ground with the DWP but said he felt humiliated and intimidated by being accused of fraud . Mr. Boon felt the whole episode was unfair, especially considering he was trying to help people like him . He stepped up to the oche at 10am, and was throwing darts all day, with a five minute rest every hour, until nearly 9pm. Robert said: 'I've always had bad eyesight, I was never allowed to drive or even play football. The only sports I was allowed to do was judo or darts. 'Two of my friends passed away recently and I wanted to name guide dogs after them, so that their names could live on. 'I was watching TV a while back and saw a blind darts team, so I decided to give it a go. 'I knew the layout of the board, when you've been playing for ten hours straight you start to get a gauge for where things are on the board. The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits . A spokesman for the Deparment for Work and Pensions said: 'It's only right that we investigate a person's benefit claim when we receive information that suggests they may not be entitled.' Mr Boon worked in the hotel business until he was diagnosed blind three years ago. He is married to his wife Donna, 52. and has one child by a previous relationship, Lauren, 11. He has said he will continue in his efforts to raise money for guide dog training, despite recent events.

After months of negotiation, the Government failed to secure the crucial agreement to protect customers, as bank bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking. The High street banks have agreed to new industry-wide rules setting out a series of steps they must take before closing branches. Blame it on the internet: As they refuse to commit to never closing 'the last bank in town', bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking . But critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country \u2013 even when there is no other bank in the community. Under the new regime banks will have to consult with local communities before any branch closure and ensure there are alternatives for customers such as free cash machines, \u2018mobile banking vans\u2019, and a local Post Office where they can sort out their finances. Existing rules stipulate that they have to go through this process only if they are closing the last branch in a town or village. Banks also have to give 12 weeks\u2019 notice before they shut a branch. Business secretary Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019. But last night Labour described the rules as another \u2018nail in the coffin for the High street\u2019, as all the major lenders have now ditched a previous commitment always to keep open the \u2018last bank in town\u2019. Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019 Lloyds became the last to do so in October, as it announced a three year plan to shut 200 branches and open 50. Efforts by Mr Cable to force banks to reinstate this commitment have been rejected and experts have warned that 978 branches around the country are now at risk. In total more than 500 branches are expected to be shut during the course of the year, with 210 closures announced so far. Of these 124 are the last branch in the community. For example, some 8,000 residents of Keynworth in Nottinghamshire have been left without a bank after the closure of their local NatWest branch earlier this year. and St Agnes in Cornwall has also lost its only branch after Barclays put down the shutters for the final time. There are now just over 9000 bank branches across the country, half the number of 25 years ago. Derek French from the Campaign for Community Banking said efforts by the coalition to beef up protection for consumers have failed. He said: . \u2018The government is trying to gloss over the fact that in reality it has achieved nothing and will not prevent hundreds of branches from disappearing from Britain\u2019s high streets. This is hugely damaging for local communities. The hardest hit will be small businesses, the elderly and the vulnerable \u2013 who rely heavily on their local bank\u2019. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: \u2018This is a massive embarrassment for Vince Cable. Local communities sometimes rely on the basic services of a branch and this feels very much like another bail in the coffin for the High Street.\u2019 The bosses of all the major banks have justified the closure of branches by stressing the soaring popularity of digital banking \u2013 both online and on smart phones. They have also argued it is not viable to keep certain branches open because so few customers use them. Royal Bank of Scotland boss Ross McEwan last year described its busiest branch as the 7.01am train from Reading to London Paddington, with over 167,000 using its mobile banking app between 7am and 8am on their commute to work every day. The British Bankers\u2019 Association says internet and mobile banking is now used for transactions worth \u00a36.4 billion a week \u2013 up from \u00a35.8 billion last year. But according to charity Age UK, more than a third of older people have mobility problems making travelling long distances to their nearest branch difficult. Almost 15pc have limited dexterity which means it is hard to use the internet while 4.8 million people aged 65 and over have never been online. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK said: \u2018Accessing cash and paying bills are essential services which must be easily available to everyone. But the combination of bank and building society closures, particularly in rural areas, and the industry\u2019s growing reliance on online services mean access has become increasingly difficult for many older people.\u2019 Vince Cable has said that the Post Office can play a vital role in providing an alternative for bank customers. Most banks already offer basic services via the Post Office\u2019s 11,500 branches.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ncritics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut up.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

They progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League thanks to a 2-0 win in the first leg, but Tuesday night was supposed to be easy. On Sunday, their place at the top of La Liga was swiped from underneath them, and 92% of fans have demanded a change in tactical approach, according to a recent poll in\u00a0AS. Most players have been criticised - Cristiano Ronaldo included - but perhaps most under-fire is Iker Casillas. Mr Real Madrid, with over 500 appearances. Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances . Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at Real Madrid . Three of Schalke's four goals could have been saved, they said. Casillas needs to leave, they said. At 33 years of age, he may well be past his best, with three European Cups, five league titles and one World Cup tucked safely under his belt. Manchester United's David De Gea has been touted as his possible replacement, and even\u00a0Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher waded into the debate on Tuesday night. 'Madrid need a new keeper. De Gea wants to win trophies. No brainer,' he wrote on Twitter. De Gea was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by Roy Keane this week, and may leave United . Keylor Navas is also waiting for his chance at the Bernabeu after joining in the summer . And perhaps he has a point. Manchester United have fallen short of expectations once more, and De Gea will be keen to taste success... where better than the city he was born? He is a Spain international, and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman. But you get the feeling that Real Madrid would not be the same without Casillas. Since 1999, he has been a main-stay at the Bernabeu. At the end of the game on Tuesday night, there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team-mates leave the pitch before thanking the Madrid fans. Casillas would not let his team-mates leave the pitch on Tuesday night before they thanked the supporters . Cristiano Ronaldo was unhappy at his side's performance, but was made to applaud the fans by Casillas . Pointing and pulling, ushering his team-mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters. But still they want rid. For the first goal, he palmed the ball into his bottom corner. For the second, he pushed it into the path of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. For the third, he was rooted to the spot. Success is in Madrid's nature, and their fans aren't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding. That starts at the back... with Casillas. Aside from De Gea's potential arrival, you can't forget the presence of Keylor Navas. Signed from Levante in the summer, he is waiting, willing, wishing for his chance. De Gea is a Spain international and grew up in Madrid, playing for Atletico before moving to Man United . Casillas has had a remarkable career, winning numerous trophies including the 2010 World Cup . But De Gea makes sense. He is 24 years old, and getting better with every game he plays. Signed by Sir Alex Ferguson for just shy of \u00a319million in 2011, United would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave. 'I think David De Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment,' Roy Keane told ITV after Monday night's FA Cup clash with Arsenal. The best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world.

Former defence chief Lord Bramall today dismissed any suggestion of his involvement in child abuse as 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. The ex-Chief of Defence Staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his home in Surrey. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland have also raided the homes of Tory grandee Leon Brittan and former MP Harvey Proctor. Operation Midland is investigating claims boys senior members of the Establishment abused young men and boys in London and the south of England in the 1970s and 1980s. It includes claims that sex parties involving boys below the age of consent were held at the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment block near the Houses of Parliament. The operation includes detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command. It is also examining allegations three young men were murdered, . At 91, Lord Bramall \u2013 the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry \u2013 is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Officers from Operation Midland searched his home last Wednesday. He told the BBC: 'Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated. It is not in my character or my psyche.' He said: 'I know I have only had sex with someone other than my own sex.' He added that any suggestion he was involved in child abuse was 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. He said he had been to events at Dolphin Square 'four or fives times' but only once went into an\u00a0apartment\u00a0there. He has not been arrested, named as a suspect by police or questioned. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer \u2013 and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords \u2013 opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'. Harvey Proctor insisted he was a 'discreet' man and had never been part of 'any rent boy ring' with Cabinet ministers, MPs or military top brass . The search of Lord Bramall's home took place on the same day as officers searched the Leicestershire home of ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, 68, prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing. Proctor, whose Parliamentary career ended in a rent boy 'spanking' scandal, said he was trapped in a 'Kafka-esque fantasy'. More than 1,000 people have been questioned by police investigating claims of historic sex abuse. The huge number, including suspects, victims and witnesses, lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources. But he pledged to get to the heart of the claims, no matter who was involved. Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Bernard said his staff were 'determinedly working their way through' all the evidence, adding: 'We've now interviewed at least 1,000 people.' Asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified, he said victims deserve answers. 'What we cannot do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago,' he said. Sir Bernard added that police 'have to prioritise' but nevertheless have 'put tens of officers into these inquiries'. He said: 'We have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds. They are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago. 'But we will get to the bottom of it, I am sure we will, so far as it is possible.'

Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as \u2018a unique moment in anyone\u2019s life\u2019. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince\u2019s life.

Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles\u2019s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate\u2019s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot\u2019s Licence.

The child robber stood trial alongside Zoheb Majid, 20, from Smethwick, who was found guilty of robbery and manslaughter. A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard\u00a0he left a shoe print on her face (pictured is the scene in\u00a0Smethwick) A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder. Mrs Bensley was on her way home from the Seven Stars when she was knocked to the ground by the schoolboy. CCTV footage revealed that  Majid arrived on his bicycle moments later and the pair turned their victim over, stealing from her pockets. A post-mortem examination of Ms Bensley revealed she died from a severe bleed on the brain. After the attack, the schoolboy fled to nearby Victoria Park to meet up with friends and was heard boasting about the murder and\u00a0selling a gold bracelet. Both robbers claimed they believed the victim was a man because of Ms Bensley's clothing and hairstyle. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year . 'They were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'The brutal attack was captured on CCTV lasting 32 seconds. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis' family at this time and we hope that today's verdict will provide some help in their grieving process.' Ms Bensley's sister Dawn, 55, from Smethwick, said: 'We are a very close and supportive family and always look out for each other.

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: \u2018These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it\u2019s all about submission and domination when of course it isn\u2019t. \u2018People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I\u2019m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.\u2019 This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said \u2018it\u2019s worse now, but I\u2019m an old person so I would say that.\u2019 She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that \u2018it\u2019s a huge problem in society.\u2019 Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine\u2019s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society\u2019s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: \u2018There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. They didn\u2019t have sex education, mainly at schools.\u2019 Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers\u2019 \u2018big sister\u2019 imparting advice. This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers\u2019 queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them. Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm . He told the programme: \u2018Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You\u2019re in an odd position, where you\u2019re meddling in strangers\u2019 lives and you\u2019re judging a whole situation by one side, you don\u2019t get the other side. \u2018Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy. \u2018Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don\u2019t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.\u2019 One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes. She said: \u2018There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe current generation of young people is confused about sex ever because of pornography.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Thanks to the European Space Agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft. The amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans, and others that are simply as they originally sounded. The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip. It took off from French Guiana at 9.46pm GMT on Friday 27 March (pictured), carrying two satellites that will expand Europe\u2019s Galileo system . The various noises from space are shared on Esa's\u00a0esaops Soundcloud page. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended. According to Esa they \u2018give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board Huygens would have heard during one minute of the descent through Titan's atmosphere.\u2019 With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn\u2019t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's \u2018water\u2019 is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe (illustrated) as it descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended . Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz. The \u2018music\u2019 was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible. Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko (pictured), as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz . The landing of Philae on the surface of 67P on 12 November 2014 is also heard in a brief clip, which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown. Philae subsequently bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest in an unknown location, wedged under a cliff somewhere in partial darkness. Scientists at Esa are hoping that the probe will wake up in the coming weeks as sunlight recharges its batteries, letting them perform more key science on the surface. Philae's first landing on the surface, seen here as pictured from the Rosetta spacecraft, can be heard in a short clip. The probe then bounced twice before coming to rest in an unknown location .

Five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City and it could prove more tense and exciting than the Barclays Premier League title race itself. Adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join Europe\u2019s elite next season must swallow an estimated \u00a330million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish . Louis van Gaal said that he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total . \u2018The best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can,\u2019 said Arsenal manager Wenger. \u2018You can see the quality of the teams behind us. Seventy-two points might be enough. \u2018People have finished in the top four with 67 points, but if you look at this year, we have 51 points, so it will be in the 70s. It is a tough run-in, similar to last year.\u2019 Arsenal finished fourth last year with 79 points, well clear of Everton in fifth with 72. It is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years. When Everton came fourth in 2005, they had 61 points ahead of Liverpool in fifth with 58. In each of the past two years, however, the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points. Van Gaal acknowledged Wenger\u2019s years of expertise in the area. \u2018I want to believe him,\u2019 said the Manchester United boss. \u2018It is a rat race. It is going into the last week.\u2019 Arsenal have not given up hope of catching City to finish second, but there is a nine-point gap to Chelsea who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top. Wenger said: \u2018We are nowhere near close to being in the title race. We are too far from Chelsea to say that we are in the title race, but you never know what can happen. \u2018Why should Manchester City give up for the title?

Attention is spread over three competitions, although maybe not for long.\u00a0They trail Monaco 1-3 in the Champions League and go to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They are awash with goals, have key players fit and options to make changes, especially up front. Also experienced top-four finishers, with an eye still on catching Manchester City. Top 7 games to play: 3. Prediction: 76pts. Wayne Rooney has returned to an attacking role since Robin van Persie's injury and has performed well there . MANCHESTER UNITED . Results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of Robin van Persie\u2019s injury has moved Wayne Rooney back up front which may prove serendipitous. But they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures, with five of the top seven to play and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle. Away form is poor, with 16 points on the road this season \u2014 the worst in top half barring West Ham. Fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals, but more likely a problem with form so sluggish. Should at least be fresh, having only played 32 games in all competitions. Top 7 games: 5. Prediction: 71pts. Liverpool have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat Manchester City . LIVERPOOL . Finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start. Helped by a settled system, the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Steven Gerrard. They boast the best form in the Premier League since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past. They also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more Europe, but finish with awkward away games at Chelsea and Stoke. No sign of fatigue but Burnley is their 45th game of the season. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 73pts. Morgan Schneiderlin has impressed for Southampton this season as the Saints surprised everyone . SOUTHAMPTON . Scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager Ronald Koeman since the end of January, as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing Champions League qualification and are plotting to stop them. Perhaps this, together with increased expectations, is catching up with them after a brilliant start. Injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which cannot boast the same depth as others pursuing the Champions League. The dream faded during February, a month when Saints scored once in five games, but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 61pts.

Exit polls showed Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists. This meant a loss of 30 of the regional councils for Francois Hollande's party, which came to power nationally in 2012. Scroll down for video . France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure' Even the Correze department - Mr Hollande's home turf in the south west - was won by the UMP. Former president Mr Sarkozy said: 'Tonight, the Republican right, and the centre, has won the departmental elections.' Referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments.' Mr Sarkozy said 'three years' under the most outdated Socialist party in Europe had brought the country to its knees, and the electorate had had enough. Exit polls showed the opposition UMP party under Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured) controlling up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists . 'A new era is starting. Hope is reborn for France,' said Mr Sarkozy. 'The road will be long and hard, but change is coming and nothing can stop it.' Also highlighting the 'failure' of the Socialists, was the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen. Although the FN was expected to win up to one department maximum, they were on course to win more than 200 seats on regional councils. Calling on Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, 'to resign', Ms Le Pen said her anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had a huge part to play in the future of France. Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, conceded 'incontestable' electoral defeat soon after the polls closed at 8pm. Far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen (pictured) also highlighted the 'failure' of the Socialists . Noting increased extremism in his country, Mr Valls said: 'Far-right gains in local elections are a sign of lasting change in the French political system'. The election will choose 4,108 local councillors and - crucially - shape the political landscape in the run-up to the 2017 presidential race. The vote was also a key test for Mr Sarkozy who, despite a series of corruption scandals, is convinced he can return to power in two years' time.

Leo Dennis Kozlowski, 68, lives in a small, rented apartment in midtown Manhattan with his third wife, Kimberly, 48, whom he met while he was spending time at Mid-State Correctional Facility in upstate New York. Kozlowski was jailed in 2005 for taking unauthorized bonuses, conspiracy and other charges.\u00a0He was also ordered to pay $167 million in restitution and fines. Former chief executive of Tyco International Dennis Kozlowski and second wife Karen leave New York State Supreme Court in June 2005 soon after he was found guilty of stealing $150 million . Kozlowski, poses with two women in toga costumes in a frame taken from an amateur video tape of the lavish $2.1 million, week-long  party for his second wife Karen's 40th birthday . Last month, he completed his parole after spending three years on work-release. He spent almost seven years behind bars for his white-collar crimes although he faced up to 25 years. During his time in jail, he was separated from other prisoners due to his 'high-profile' status. Although he knows that he did wrong, Kozlowski admitted to The New York Times in a recent interview that he feels plenty more on Wall Street did not pay the price. Kozlowski's fall from grace - known as 'deal-a-day' Dennis, he turned Massachusetts-based Tyco from a small firm into a $150billion force \u00a0- was a gripping case of schadenfreude for the tabloids because of the gaudy life of excess he had led. In the early 2000s, The New York Post published a picture of him under the headline 'Oink Oink' after revelations emerged of his\u00a0$6,000 gold-and-burgundy shower curtain in his lavish, $30million 5th Avenue apartment paid for by Tyco. But as he told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0this week: 'I was piggy. But I\u2019m not that person anymore.' Kozlowski's princely lifestyle was legendary - he owned a multi-million-dollar art collection and had an oceanfront estate in Nantucket and a mansion tucked in an exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. Tyco also paid half of the $2million cost of Kozlowski's second wife, Karen's 40th birthday party in 2001. Held on the island of Sardinia, the bash had a 'Roman orgy' theme and featured an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David urinating Stolichnaya vodka. \u00a0Jimmy Buffet was flown in to perform. Karen Mayo (second left)  poses with a friend and two men in gladiator costumes at her $2million birthday bash - half of which was paid for by Tyco . The Tyco CEO once had a home in this exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. He also owned a home in Nantucket and on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan . The businessman also owned a 130-foot yacht, Endeavor, which he would sail around the world to compete in regattas. Life now, couldn't be more different. Mr Kozlowski's time behind bars has given him perspective on simple pleasures. He loves spending time with his grandchildren, enjoys subway rides, eating avocados - and even trips to the dentist. He also paid tribute to his third wife Kimberly Fusaro - a divorced Wall Street trader whom he met behind bars after she began writing to him. She began visiting him in 2009 and sending fresh fruit and vegetables from the garden of her Long Island cottage. He proposed to her with a $300 Cubic zirconium ring and they got married last year. He also got a job as part of his parole requirement. He borrowed an office from a friend in Midtown and consults on low-profile\u00a0mergers and acquisitions. He would not discuss his finances with The Times but claimed to have 'no real estate' and a hold a 'minuscule percentage' of the New York Yankees. Fortunately for its  employees, Tyco is still standing, making security systems and employing around 57,000 people.

(HarperCollins \u00a318.99) Tom Jones has been a genuine global star for half a century. How many other people can say that? By my reckoning, it\u2019s no more than a handful: Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood and HM The Queen. And only one of them, I believe, lives in a larger house than Sir Tom\u2019s. Sir Tom Jones (pictured in Los Angeles in 1978) had his first No 1 in the UK in March 1965 . It was in March 1965 that his first hit, It\u2019s Not Unusual, went to No 1 in the UK and made him famous. To this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. Another significant milestone approaches on June 7, when he will turn 75 years old. All of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed, no-holds-barred hardback biography. Smith\u2019s is not the first \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the twelfth. But it\u2019s the first for nearly two years, and should keep us going until the autumn, when Sir Tom\u2019s autobiography is due out. What else will the great man be able to reveal, given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made? Tom (pictured in early 1970s) married his wife Linda in 1957 when they were both only 16-years-old . For Sir Tom has not lived a particularly secretive life. Though married to Linda, nee Trenchard, for 58 years, and happily so, he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life. But as long as Linda doesn\u2019t have to read about it in the newspaper \u2014 let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t read this \u2014 she turns a blind eye. It\u2019s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it. It\u2019s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it. Such opportunities would never have arisen, of course, without the talent. Jones was born with the gift of a golden voice, and he knows exactly what to do with it. This was apparent on his first hit, and has not wavered since. Tom Jones (pictured) was born\u00a0Thomas Woodward but was persuaded to change his name by his manager\u00a0Gordon Mills, who also persuaded the star to move to London from Wales . Quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but, under the watchful eye of his son, Mark, who has managed him since the mid-Eighties, he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans. Several generations, in fact. The backstory is well known. Babies hear it on their mothers\u2019 knees, and then tell it to their own babies many years later. Born Thomas Woodward in Treforest, South Wales, the infant Tom \u2018had an edge, even as a youngster in short trousers. He didn\u2019t just sing a song; he performed it with verve and passion\u2019. Aged 12, he lost a year at school through tuberculosis; at 16, he was married with a child on the way. \u2018Most of the girls found him very attractive,\u2019 said one schoolmate. \u2018He seemed a bit rough to me, but he definitely had the charisma. He had a way with him, a swagger.\u2019 Tom Jones (right) is pictured with his manager, Gordon Mills (left), in January 1969. Mills worked as the superstar's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986 . The climb from obscurity, though, was long and arduous. Tom was a member of a band called The Senators, who weren\u2019t going anywhere terribly fast. A sharp-eyed young manager, Gordon Mills, persuaded him to move to London, change his name to \u2018Tom Jones\u2019 and begin a solo career. He was already in his mid-20s. For 20 years, until Gordon died of cancer, Tom always deferred to his expertise. In return, Gordon did all Tom\u2019s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking. It was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly. Hits in the Sixties led to Las Vegas in the Seventies, and what might best be described as the Underwear Throwing Years. No bow-tie was larger or fluffier than Tom\u2019s, no hips swivelled more suggestively. Elvis was a good friend and was convinced Tom wore a sock down the front of his trousers. Tom knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them, though he didn\u2019t like it when John Lennon, with his characteristic Scouse wit, called him a \u2018Welsh poof\u2019. Would anyone? Tom (pictured) has been a judge on the Voice UK talent show since 2012, as has will.i.am (pictured) Nonetheless, an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when Tom recorded five consecutive country albums in the early Eighties. The live tours and Vegas residencies had made him hedge-fund rich. He and Linda lived in splendour in California, with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner. But was it making him happy? Well, yes, but at the same time, Tom clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier, rootsier music he had first loved. It hasn\u2019t been an entirely easy ride since then, but his last two studio albums, Praise & Blame (2010) and Spirit In The Room (2012), have been the best of his long career. What comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man. Other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises, when they have clearly had the lot done. Sir Tom Jones has also had the lot done \u2014 but cheerfully admits to it. He has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket, yet is generous with family and close friends, as you or I would be in his position. He doesn\u2019t like drugs or gambling, but enjoys a good cigar, and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good. Sir Tom (pictured), unlike many other celebrities, has admitted to having had plastic surgery work . Smith is an efficient chronicler of the life, as befits an old pro whose previous books have included Kylie, Gary (Barlow), Alesha (Dixon), Tulisa, Kate (Middleton), Cheryl and, of course, Victoria. There are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge: Leonard Cohen\u2019s song is called Tower Of Song, not Tower Of Strength, for instance, and he doesn\u2019t know that Burt Bacharach did not write the lyrics to his songs, which is a bit poor. But his book bounces along happily enough, forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every-thing and become universally adored. As Rob Brydon put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award: \u2018Tom Jones has lived the life we would all love to live.\u2019 I have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept, and Sir Tom probably sang It\u2019s Not Unusual for about the 20,000th time.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\npaul mccartney, bob dylan, clint eastwood and hm the queen.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Katie launched an attack on Danny's partner Joanne Mas, saying: 'no\u00a0woman should ever propose to a man,' to which the EastEnders star responded: 'I agree...especially when you look like ya face should be on the side of a gothic building,' and calling her sexist. But a post-graduate English student who proposed to her boyfriend using a personalised pint glass tells FEMAIL that Katie's notions of marriage are outdated. Katy Miller, 24, and Tim O\u2019Brien, 29, who are from Texas but currently live in Portugal, had been dating for several years before she decided to take the plunge last April. She said: 'My partner and I first met at an Irish pub in Texas. 'We both very much enjoy drinking craft beer, visiting breweries, and sampling the local beers in every city (and country) we visit.' She continued: 'I knew he would love it if I tied this common interest into a proposal, so I picked a quiet craft beer pub in a residential area of Dublin to bring things full circle. 'I was a graduate student in Manchester at the time, so Ireland wasn\u2019t very far away. 'I had a pint glass etched with \u2018Tim, after you finish this pint, I\u2019m going to ask you a question\u2026\u2019 on the side, while the bottom that he\u2019d see after downing the pint said \u2018\u2026will you marry me?\u2019 The pint glass that Katy commissioned for her proposal to boyfriend Tim . Tim was delighted with the proposal and immediately said yes, with the pair choosing to elope just a few months later. They said their handwritten vows on a hilltop in a quiet village on the\u00a0island of Mallorca, which Katy describes as, 'One of the happiest moments of our lives.' Katy is proud of her decision to propose to Tim and believes that Ms Hopkins' views on marriage are outdated. She said: 'There are things of real importance women do every day that are cause for actual celebration. 'A woman proposing to a man is not one of them, and I wish it were such an unremarkable event that we never felt the need to discuss it or to defend ourselves. 'Unfortunately, that is not the case, particularly not in the southern US where we are from.' Etched onto the bottom of the pint glass was the question 'Will you marry me?' While Katy and Tim's close friends and family were delighted at their happy news, she does admit that there was a backlash for more small minded people. She reveals: 'People asked if it was an April Fools joke (it was April 16th) and asked me if the proposal was actually for real. 'Acquaintances of my partner had a hard time understanding the concept, and we heard the phrase \u2018real man\u2019 tossed around, as if a \u2018real man\u2019 isn\u2019t any man. 'But the main source of awkward interactions was my lack of an engagement ring.' Katie Hopkins and Danny Dyer got into a Twitter row yesterday after the reality star criticised the actor's girlfriend for proposing to him . Katy believes that in order for us to move into a fully equal society, issues like who proposes to who shouldn't even be a topic of conversation. She said: 'This narrative of men always proposing and that being the only option is incredibly dull. 'When it comes to relationships, everyone should do what is best for them; however, I refuse to believe that following a man\u2019s lead is what\u2019s best for every single woman. 'Perhaps some women, like me, want to make romantic gestures to their partner. 'Obviously there are far more important feminist issues in society than who is proposing to whom, but if we\u2019re going to speak out against gender roles, then why has this antiquated tradition remained so firmly in place? 'Instead, there\u2019s this stigma where people see a woman who proposes as someone who is tired of waiting around for the man to do it. 'The word \u2018emasculation\u2019 is often thrown around when a woman proposes, and I find this entirely ridiculous and offensive to both men and women.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nkatie launched an attack saying: 'no woman should ever propose to a man'\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.'

Sunglasses? Check. Twenty-four degree heat? Check. Now all I need is a fruity cocktail and I could be in Mauritius. Except I\u2019m not on holiday. I\u2019m in a basement in central London, moments from the frenzy of Oxford Street. Outside, it\u2019s a typical day \u2014 cold and damp, with a sky as grey and heavy as old army boots. It\u2019s estimated that two million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is caused by a lack of sunlight - and up to three times more women than men appear to be affected . Down here, amid the lemon trees and pink, plastic bougainvillea, it\u2019s so tropical that I half expect Barry Manilow to cha-cha-cha past singing the Copacabana. Welcome to the cheapest winter sunspot in Britain. This is a \u2018Real Sunlight\u2019 clinic, where anyone can drop in for a burst of cheering warmth. But you don\u2019t have to face the airport, and it won\u2019t cost you thousands of pounds. At the flick of a switch, you can flit between Mauritius, Miami and Bali \u2014 or, at least, their sunshine equivalents. Dr Daya (pictured) originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winter . As holidays go, it\u2019s pretty convenient: no passport, no packing and the weather is guaranteed. It\u2019s estimated that 2 million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), caused by a lack of sunlight, with up to three times more women than men affected. Symptoms include low-level depression, lack of energy and a loss of enthusiasm for life. The syndrome is so widespread, the NHS has set up a web page giving advice on how to tackle it \u2014 which includes artificial sun. In the past, if you were down in the dumps during winter, the advice would be to buck up or buy a ticket somewhere hot. But what if you can\u2019t afford to? What if you\u2019re trapped on this cold, damp isle until the spring, whenever that may be? It was only when a colleague cheerfully announced that he was off to Goa, in India, for a fortnight that I thought, hang on, I need some sunshine, too! Which is how I found myself slipping on my flip-flops at Dr Daya\u2019s Wholistic Medical Centre on that Monday afternoon. Dr Daya is the sort of GP you find a lot of around Harley Street. A private practitioner, she\u2019s open to alternative medicine, \u2018taking a holistic approach, looking at the whole body and lifestyle, not just one part of it\u2019. Prince Charles would approve. Hers is the only clinic in Britain to offer a \u2018real sunshine\u2019 room to the public. It opened in 2009, though she has just moved premises and spruced it up. It\u2019s a normal-sized sitting room, done up to feel like a tropical holiday. The walls are papered with verdant scenes and artificial grass, jaunty pot plants hang off wooden screens, soothing music plays in the background. In a corner, above your head, beams the \u2018artificial sun\u2019. It looks like a row of wall-mounted security lights \u2014 three square boxes, the sort you might get at a football stadium. Dr Daya's Wholistic Medical Centre (pictured) in central London where you can experience the Miami sun . The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya \u00a325,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box \u2014 which beams out an assimilation of natural light \u2014 for \u00a350. \u2018Light boxes do work,\u2019 says Dr Daya, \u2018but this is out of this world. This is the full spectrum \u2014 infra-red, UVA, UVB and you get the heat, whereas with SAD boxes, you just get visible light.\u2019 The inventor of the equipment, Ingemar Nilsson, stumbled upon his creation by mistake in 1997. Commissioned to create a sunlight tunnel for Swedish car manufacturer Saab to test the effects of the sun\u2019s rays on different paints, he noticed that the factory workers liked to congregate under the sun lamps during their breaks. He realised people could get benefits from sitting under the artificial sunlight he\u2019d created. So he spent some years adapting his equipment to make it 100 per cent safe for human use, and ten years later had created the technology he sells now. Initially, the biggest demand for sunlight rooms came from the elderly and nursing homes. The first private sunlight room was created in Sweden, and there have now been 150 installations worldwide. In Britain, 11 have been installed in care homes and there are three belonging to private individuals. \u2018Some people really go to town with replicating a holiday feel for their sunlight rooms,\u2019 says Karl Emanuelsson, the UK company representative. \u2018People put sand on the floor, surround sound systems to replicate the sea, the smell of coconut wafting through to create a truly multi-sensory experience.\u2019 Dr Daya originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winters. \u2018I was born in Africa and I really need the sun,\u2019 she says. \u2018I don\u2019t think you need to have been born in Africa to feel you\u2019re missing the sun here, but that was my excuse. \u2018When I was 13, I was sent from Tanzania to boarding school here, and I still can\u2019t get over how long the winters are.\u2019 A woman looks at a ' light lounge' - a treatment aimed at Seasonal Affective Disorder sufferers (SAD) Back in Tanzania, which lies on the Equator, there is an average of 2,836 hours of sun per year, out of a possible 4,383. In Britain, the average is typically less than half that, ranging from 1,364 per year in Birmingham to 1,888 in Eastbourne. Dr Daya had heard of sunlight simulators in spas and health clinics, and decided to buy one for herself. \u2018I thought it was a bit extravagant, and that I should really share it with other people, so I opened the sun room,\u2019 she says. She charges \u00a350 for a one-hour session, which seems a lot to spend on an hour under a hot lamp \u2014 but, on the other hand, it\u2019s less than the cost of a holiday and, as soon as you flick the switch, you\u2019re hit in the face with that lovely, warm feeling, as if you\u2019ve just stepped off a plane in the Caribbean. There are three settings: an hour of \u2018Bali\u2019 is the mildest, equivalent to a long sunset, while \u2018Miami\u2019, Dr Daya\u2019s favourite, is 45 minutes of full whack, then 15 minutes of winding down. She finds \u2018Mauritius\u2019 is the most popular, as it\u2019s the strongest, so that\u2019s what I plump for. And, boy, do those lamps give off light. Not just light, but heat. In seconds, the room is toasty warm, and I\u2019m breaking into a sweat. You can wear what you like \u2014 Dr Daya likes to spend an hour here after work, in her underwear, catching up with reading. Some visit as couples, while others pop in for a solitary hour in their lunch break. But what are the actual health benefits? We know we get a large part of our vitamin D intake \u2014 important for the promotion of calcium and healthy bones \u2014 from the sun. Some of our intake also comes from food such as oily fish. But from October to April, 90 per cent of the UK lies too far north to have enough UVB rays in sunlight necessary to make vitamin D in the skin. So, if they\u2019re not eating enough oily fish and are spending too much time indoors, many are at risk of being vitamin D deficient. Which is where a burst in a sunny room could be just the ticket. But just a burst \u2014 and no more. There\u2019s a risk of getting skin cancer if you spend too much time in the room. \u2018The recommended dose is no more than one hour a day, which is completely safe,\u2019 says Dr Daya. \u2018But if you did three hours every day, we couldn\u2019t vouch for the effects. 'It\u2019s like anything \u2014 it\u2019s important not to overdo it.\u2019 Dr Daya claims her time in the sun room makes her sleep better and feel more energetic during the day. And one elderly user of a nursing home sunlight room says it helps alleviate aches and pains, especially joints, and has a positive effect on his brain power \u2014 it helps him tackle the crossword much quicker. After leaving Dr Daya\u2019s clinic, I do feel more cheerful and friends say I have a rosy complexion, compared with my normal pasty, winter face. I ask Dr Daya if she still feels the need to go on holiday. \u2018Who wants to go on holiday when you can have one every day in your office?\u2019 she replies. Good point. Even so, I could still do with a week in Mauritius. The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya \u00a325,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box, which beams out an assimilation of natural light, like this one, the Lumie Zip for \u00a3150 .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ni'm is in a basement in central london.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City and it could prove more tense and exciting than the Barclays Premier League title race itself. Adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join Europe\u2019s elite next season must swallow an estimated \u00a330million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish . Louis van Gaal said that he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total . \u2018The best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can,\u2019 said Arsenal manager Wenger. \u2018You can see the quality of the teams behind us. Seventy-two points might be enough. \u2018People have finished in the top four with 67 points, but if you look at this year, we have 51 points, so it will be in the 70s. It is a tough run-in, similar to last year.\u2019 Arsenal finished fourth last year with 79 points, well clear of Everton in fifth with 72. It is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years. When Everton came fourth in 2005, they had 61 points ahead of Liverpool in fifth with 58. In each of the past two years, however, the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points. Van Gaal acknowledged Wenger\u2019s years of expertise in the area. \u2018I want to believe him,\u2019 said the Manchester United boss. \u2018It is a rat race. It is going into the last week.\u2019 Arsenal have not given up hope of catching City to finish second, but there is a nine-point gap to Chelsea who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top. Wenger said: \u2018We are nowhere near close to being in the title race. We are too far from Chelsea to say that we are in the title race, but you never know what can happen. \u2018Why should Manchester City give up for the title? They did it before from eight points behind. Without speculating on the weaknesses of any team, we want to be consistent and do as well as we can.\u2019 World Cup winner Mesut Ozil has been in impressive form for Arsenal since returning from injury . ARSENAL . Suffered a Euro wobble but form is strong in the Premier League, winning six of seven since defeat at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day, after which Wenger switched goalkeepers. Attention is spread over three competitions, although maybe not for long.\u00a0They trail Monaco 1-3 in the Champions League and go to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They are awash with goals, have key players fit and options to make changes, especially up front. Also experienced top-four finishers, with an eye still on catching Manchester City. Top 7 games to play: 3. Prediction: 76pts. Wayne Rooney has returned to an attacking role since Robin van Persie's injury and has performed well there . MANCHESTER UNITED . Results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of Robin van Persie\u2019s injury has moved Wayne Rooney back up front which may prove serendipitous. But they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures, with five of the top seven to play and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle. Away form is poor, with 16 points on the road this season \u2014 the worst in top half barring West Ham. Fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals, but more likely a problem with form so sluggish. Should at least be fresh, having only played 32 games in all competitions. Top 7 games: 5. Prediction: 71pts. Liverpool have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat Manchester City . LIVERPOOL . Finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start. Helped by a settled system, the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Steven Gerrard. They boast the best form in the Premier League since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past. They also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more Europe, but finish with awkward away games at Chelsea and Stoke. No sign of fatigue but Burnley is their 45th game of the season. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 73pts. Morgan Schneiderlin has impressed for Southampton this season as the Saints surprised everyone . SOUTHAMPTON . Scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager Ronald Koeman since the end of January, as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing Champions League qualification and are plotting to stop them. Perhaps this, together with increased expectations, is catching up with them after a brilliant start. Injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which cannot boast the same depth as others pursuing the Champions League. The dream faded during February, a month when Saints scored once in five games, but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 61pts. Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, scoring 24 goals so far in all competitions . TOTTENHAM . In a mini-slump after five without a win in all competitions and bruised by a Europa League exit and Wembley defeat inside three days. Can they be revived and refocused after a gruelling season of 45 games to date? There are 12 more to go, including seven tricky away fixtures. It is a character test for a young team which has key players such as Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Eric Dier completing their first full Premier League campaign. Or will boss Mauricio Pochettino have to go back to those he has cut off, such as Younes Kaboul and Emmanuel Adebayor? Top 7 games: 3.

Armani and DSquared2 showcased their AW15 offerings on  Monday and whilst Kendall Jenner was too ill to walk in any shows, there was still plenty to talk about. They had a big act to follow after Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana - the head honchos at Dolce & Gabbana\u00a0kicked the week off with style when they unveiled their collection, Viva la Mamma, in all its glory yesterday. Giorgio Armani unveiled the 'skouser' (right) - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, bold dresses, left, and fringed shawls worn around the waist (left) Is it a soft furnishing or an evening gown? Armani seemed influenced by interiors with this dress . Giorgio Armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what Vogue are dubbing the 'skouser' - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, which were paired with fur jackets and blouses. Elsewhere on the catwalk were the classic tuxedos that Armani does so well, as well as sequin jackets and even more fringed ponchos. He also showcased strapless dresses with ruched bust lines that looked eerily like curtain pelmets or bed skirts. Yet as he celebrates 40 years of his brand this year, Armani proved he's still a byword for mature elegance. Italian heavy hitter Giorgio Armani wore his signature all-black on the catwalk after this AW15 show . But elsewhere, the shows proved that in Milan - more is more. We saw boho vibes on the Burberry catwalk in London. Similarly, Matthew Williamson stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection inspired by the signs of the Zodiac. Following suit, DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos. The tribal prints, which came in every colourway, completely clashed - but with aplomb. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, who head up DSquared2, called on catwalk stalwarts Malaika Firth and Lily Donaldson to showcase their elaborate multi-layered AW15 designs in the Italian city today. The pair appeared to draw on their country's Inuit roots with parkas with huge fur-lined hoods, thong ties and bold tribal prints. These Native American-influenced pieces were teamed with European colonial-era clothes such as culottes with admiral's gold detailing at the hems. DSquared2 sent models out in flouncy, Inuit-like designs teamed with fur-lined boots, capes and ponchos . Brit favourite Lily Donaldson walked in the DSquared2 show in Milan on Monday . Models also wore nude body stockings printed with native patterns to evoke body paint or tribal tattoos. But hair and make-up were kept simple with bronzed glowing skin and loose hair. British beauty Lily Donaldson wore a mixture of styles including gold-embossed navy admiral's trousers, Native American feather trim, beaded bag and sandals and a trapper-style fur decoration. Slung over all of that was an enormous ruby and diamond necklace and opulent sapphire and diamond drop earrings. Other looks included Native American blankets worn with cropped jackets and huge necklaces or voluminous white dresses teamed with a masculine admiral's jacket. Canadian fashion designers and twin brothers, Dean and Dan Caten, head up DSquared2 and rocked the runway with a tribal-inspired collection . Dolce & Gabbana's show, Viva la Mamma, invited models to walk the runway with their children in Milan . While yesterday Dolce & Gabbana created a memorable show aimed at celebrating motherhood. The flamboyant duo - who are known for drawing on long-held ideas and imagery of Italian womanhood, whether it's the sensual town vamp or a black-clad nonna - sent models on to the catwalk with children as accessories, walking to the beat of Spice Girl's Nineties hit, Mama. There were toddlers and babies all dressed in the Italian house's sumptuous silks and luxurious lace. Called the Viva La Mamma show, other motifs running through the collection were the deep red, almost Gothic, roses (traditionally given on Mother's Day in Italy), vintage brooches, midi dresses, black lace and corsetry. Aimed at celebrating motherhood, models took to the catwalk armed with their own children as accessories . Dresses were dedicated to the mother and came with hand-stitched red roses . The curtains opened to the sight of mothers and their children and the sounds of Spice Girl's iconic hit, Mama . Famous face Karlie Kloss walks the runway at the Dolce & Gabbana show . The slogans 'Amore' and 'Mama' were embroidered or appliqued and some dresses were emblazoned with prints of Madonna and child, others were decorated with childlike Crayola drawings. Models wore their hair back but parted in the centre, in the style of chic 1940s Italian women, and their lips matched the crimson rose embroidery. However, Salvatore Ferragamo's collection had a more restrained Sixties feel with a brown, beige and maroon palette and graphic prints on the catwalk - as well as the dresses. Dresses, skirts and knits were covered in vertical  panels and the geometry theme carried through to most of the looks. Fluid silk dresses were constructed from different coloured tessellated panels, other tunics and skirts were high-necked and severe. Where Dolce & Gabbana was over-the-top and elaborate, Ferragamo was pared-down and minimalist, helping to set the stage for the final day in Italy tomorrow before the focus shifts to Paris Fashion Week.

Zaur Dadayev told two members of Russia's human rights council that he pleaded guilty after being detained because he was scared. He told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin he had been tortured and the well-being of his family and friends were threatened. Dadayev was one of two suspects recently charged in the case. Three other suspects have not been charged. Merkacheva and Babushkin were accused of \"interfering\" with the investigation and will be summoned for questioning over their motives, authorities said. Russia's Investigative Committee stated that the two rights activists violated the law when they visited and questioned Dadayev in a Moscow jail. Amnesty International condemned the Russian officials' decision to go after the activists, saying that a \"threat to bring criminal charges\" against the rights activists \"raises alarming questions over the fairness of the investigation.\" Anton Tsvetkov, the head of the Public Chamber's commission for public security, said Dadyev and two other suspects denied being involved in the shooting of the Russian opposition leader. He said a doctor found no signs of torture during an examination of the three men. Shagit Gubashev and Anzor Gubashev had no bruises or wounds despite the fact they allege they were beaten by police, Tsvetkov said. Dadayev did have a cracked tooth and handcuff marks on his wrists. Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in February 27. The three suspects visited by Tsvetkov deny they are guilty and have appealed their arrests, he said. Putin has condemned Nemtsov's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate, the Kremlin has said. He also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice.

The man, named only as Saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives. Jihadi John, who was recently unmasked as 26-year-old Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was last seen in a video posted online which appeared to show Japanese hostage Kenji Goto lying dead. Saleh, who worked as a translator, also revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die. ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi who is known as Jihadi John (seen, left, with Japanese hostage Kenji Goto) was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives, claims a defector known as Saleh (right) Face of a killer:\u00a0Saleh, who worked as a translator, revealed that Emwazi (above) routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die . Speaking to told Sky News in broken English from Turkey after fleeing ISIS, Saleh said: 'When he killed Kenji Goto, I live showed this (saw this) but not near, from a little (distance). 'The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say \"put this camera there, change place there\" but John (was) the big boss. 'All time, all time say to all \"fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish\". So respect him. Only he talks orders - others do.' Saleh said the prisoners would be given Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured that they would not be killed. He said: 'He would say to me \"say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. \"We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors\".' Saleh said he explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed. His comments explain why so many of the prisoners appear so calm in the executions videos right up to the point where the knife is placed against their throat. A still photo of  Kenji Goto holding a picture of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh. ISIS defector Saleh revealed how hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends . After Mr Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. Appearing with his face covered, the man added Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. He said: 'Maybe because he use the knife. I cannot understand why he is so strong. 'One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in ISIS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John.' And hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, with their captors telling them they would not be killed as it was a show for the camera, according to Saleh. Murderer: Jihadi John seen (in black mask) leading the execution of a dozen prisoners. Emwazi was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to defector Saleh . Kuwait-born Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities, but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. In e-mail exchanges with a journalist, the University of Westminster computer programming graduate said he considered suicide after coming face to face with what he suspected to be a British spy as he attempted to sell a laptop computer in 2010. Jihadi John rose to notoriety after he first appeared in a video posted online last August, in which he appeared to kill American journalist James Foley. Dressed in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose, and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year. Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding. But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party. Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer. Rebecca Darnell (right) hanged herself hours after her sister Jo's (second right) wedding . Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.' Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fianc\u00e9 Matt Wilson. 'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk. Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight. Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey. Ms Darnell (right) pictured in the bridesmaid's dress in which she was found dead after her sister's wedding last November . Carlo\u00a0Salamone (pictured with his sister Mirella Newman-Bale, who also gave evidence at today's hearing) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell, his partner of four years, to marry him this summer . She was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a Masters degree in family therapy. 'She was my life partner,' the garage owner said. 'That evening at the wedding I had spoken to Jo's husband and arranged the following summer in Dubai [where the newlyweds lived] to ask Rebecca to marry me. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.' However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.' The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening. Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems. Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist. He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.' She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.' 'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added. Ms Darnell (pictured, third from right) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Jo and her husband Matt Wilson. Family had described her as the 'life and soul of the party' at the event . Earlier last year, Ms Darnell organised her sister's hen party. Family said they could not explain her actions . Mr Salamone's sister Mirella Newman-Bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening, when confided her worries about work and study. The pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things. Rebecca's cousin Samantha Nash, aged 24 years, said she had seen Ms Darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding. Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her. However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011. Records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team, providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems. Her line manager Luke Hedge said Rebecca had been a 'natural giver and supporter of others.' Offering his sympathies to her parents and partner, coroner Richard Travers said Rebecca had been a 'remarkable force.' 'It is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people,' he said. 'I have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work. 'On a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006, which it seems, was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with. 'It is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner, family, work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in Boo's intentions on the day she died. 'On the 8th of November 2013 Boo's sister was married. Boo had played a major role in planning the hen do, which albeit stressful, seems to have gone very well. 'I heard that during the course of the wedding in the main Boo was her usual bubbly, lively self and that she, as her father told me, had been the 'life and soul of the party.' 'It is also right that at other times she had been very emotional. Clearly she did have things on her mind. How much her emotional outbursts were affected by alcohol, I do not know.' He ruled out a verdict of suicide, as he could not find any clear intention, such as leaving a suicide note and Rebecca had made plans to see friends and family for the coming days. 'Consequently I conclude Rebecca died from self-inflicted injuries but her intention was unclear,' he said.

This one's goofier and tastier, and won't leave you needing a change of clothes.  It's the #TwizzlerChallenge. So what's this challenge all about?  Think of the spaghetti scene from \"Lady and the Tramp,\" except substitute a Twizzler for the noodle. Chomp and chomp and chomp until your lips meet in the middle, then smooch.  Simple enough. You're supposed to do a video, of course, and challenge others to do the same for a good cause. The ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on Comedy Central's \"Night of Too Many Stars,\" a fundraiser for autism programs. A tweet from sportscaster Fred Katz challenged the \"Today\" show's Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba, who plays  Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" to share a \"Lady and the Tramp\" licorice. It took off from there.  Next thing you knew, Geist was repeating the stunt with Meredith Vieira and the #TwizzlerChallenge was on. Geist and Vieira challenged Matt Lauer and Kathy Lee Gifford.  They were good sports about it, but you may want to close your eyes here.  This isn't for the faint of heart. The challenge is starting to invade social media.  Just search the hashtag #TwizzlerChallenge. It sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at Twizzlers.  Their candy is on the lips of America. And to their credit, a couple of Twizzlers executives took the challenge and donated $10,000. The money goes to New York Collaborates for Autism.  The group funds and creates schools, programs and services for people with autism nationwide. Since 2006, \"Night of Too Many Stars\" has raised over $22 million.  If this challenge is even half as successful as the Ice Bucket Challenge, that number will triple.

The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, punched charity worker Glynis Bensley, 47,\u00a0in the head and stamped on her  before stealing her money, phone and jewellery. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in\u00a0September last year. The child robber stood trial alongside Zoheb Majid, 20, from Smethwick, who was found guilty of robbery and manslaughter. A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard\u00a0he left a shoe print on her face (pictured is the scene in\u00a0Smethwick) A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder. Mrs Bensley was on her way home from the Seven Stars when she was knocked to the ground by the schoolboy. CCTV footage revealed that  Majid arrived on his bicycle moments later and the pair turned their victim over, stealing from her pockets. A post-mortem examination of Ms Bensley revealed she died from a severe bleed on the brain. After the attack, the schoolboy fled to nearby Victoria Park to meet up with friends and was heard boasting about the murder and\u00a0selling a gold bracelet. Both robbers claimed they believed the victim was a man because of Ms Bensley's clothing and hairstyle. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year . 'They were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'The brutal attack was captured on CCTV lasting 32 seconds. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis' family at this time and we hope that today's verdict will provide some help in their grieving process.' Ms Bensley's sister Dawn, 55, from Smethwick, said: 'We are a very close and supportive family and always look out for each other. 'To try and explain how Glynis' murder has affected us is very hard to put into words. 'Glynis was my only sister and best friend. I would describe her as my right arm and I thought we would grow old together.' A full statement from the victim's family read: 'We as individuals and collectively as a family have lost a great friend. 'We are unable to express in words the impact that our loss is having on our family. 'Whilst we get on with the day-to-day trivialities of life, the circumstances of Glynis' death remind us all of the important things in life. 'At the time of Glynis' death she was upbeat and looking forward to family holidays and celebrations including her own birthday later that month. 'Glynis spent her life caring for others working in roles for the British Heart Foundation, animal welfare, and was also an active fundraiser for charity's Cancer Research, Mencap and Cystic Fibrosis.

We are on the very spot where Matthew Crawley asked Lady Mary to marry him in the first Downton Abbey Christmas special, broadcast in 2011. Remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell? When Matthew got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose? For many viewers, this was their all-time favourite Downton scene. Scroll down for video . To the manor married: Lady Carnarvon, the real-life equivalent of Downton Abbey\u2019s Cora, in front of Highclere . \u2018Well, that wasn\u2019t my favourite scene!\u2019 cries the Countess of Carnarvon, the current chatelaine of Highclere and the real-life equivalent of Downton\u2019s Cora, who\u2019s Countess of Grantham. \u2018The crew were using ash to recreate the snow. It got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms. And the smell! Very acrid. We reached the point where we had to stop them doing it.\u2019 Lady Carnarvon has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home. On the plus side, there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic; the crowds paying \u00a320 a head to goggle at the splendour of her Highclere interiors and the red velvet sofas where the Crawleys gather to take tea. \u2018Yes. It\u2019s like that show, Poke Your Nose Through The Keyhole,\u2019 she says. On the downside, damage and disruption. \u2018I do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about, but my husband goes around picking it up. We fill black bags with the stuff.\u2019 And since the very first day of Downton filming, when a technician smashed a much-loved green objet de vertu trinket box, she has been on red alert for transgressions. When she is not telling the crew that she pops open the champagne the minute they leave, she is issuing instructions on the correct way to move precious antique furniture. \u2018You lift a girl in your arms and a chair by its bottom,\u2019 she will say. As Carson the butler (\u2018Oh, I adore him, he is divine\u2019) would no doubt agree, the problem with having high standards is that so few manage to live up to them. Another who has incurred her displeasure is Ralph Lauren. The wealthy American designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at Highclere, hosted by the Earl and Countess. The Laurens committed the social faux pas of taking numerous photographs of themselves grinning cheesily on the famous Oak Staircase, and elsewhere in sumptuous Highclere, then proudly posting the snaps online. Her ladyship was not best pleased. \u2018My interpretation of dinner is having a meal and his interpretation is taking photographs. It seemed to get out of hand. I have to live with that.\u2019 Has she seen the pictures? \u2018No and I don\u2019t want to, because I don\u2019t want to be irritated by them. My idea of a nice evening is having a conversation, not taking snaps. I have never knowingly taken a selfie, I am useless at photography. I am just . . . different, I suppose.\u2019 The Countess of Carnarvon is the equivalent of Downton\u2019s Cora, played by Elizabeth McGovern . To whizz down the mile-long drive to Highclere Castle is to travel back in time to a more gracious age. The stately home made famous by Downton has been the ancestral seat of the Earls of Carnarvon since 1679. Flanked by elegant pines planted from seed three centuries ago, the house sits in a rolling landscape designed by Capability Brown. To look upon the soaring architecture of Highclere is to understand the ambition and conceit of the old English upper classes, who once thought that life behind these ramparts of Bath stone, surrounded by Reynolds, Van Dycks and walls covered in green French silk, would go on for ever. Yet even the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Lord and Lady Grantham in the fictional series is far removed from the realities of today. My dears, in the real Downton, the current chatelaine doesn\u2019t even have a lady\u2019s maid. \u2018Certainly not!\u2019 she says. \u2018And sadly not, because I would absolutely love one.\u2019 In this house, with more than 300 rooms and \u2018about 80\u2019 bedrooms, the servants\u2019 bellboard is still there outside the kitchen, just as it was over 100 years ago. But now, instead of tinkling bells, estate staff are summoned by the crackling walkie-talkie her ladyship carries in her hand. Here, amid her six dogs, her horses, her staff and her husband, Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme. She was Fiona Aitken before she married Geordie Herbert, the Queen\u2019s godson and soon to be eighth Earl of Carnarvon, 16 years ago. Fiona was a foxy blonde and arch Sloane Ranger. The eldest of six sisters, she was raised in Fulham, West London, and is a trained accountant who once designed and sold crushed velvet evening wraps to other Sloanes. Only two years after they married, she and Geordie took over Highclere when the seventh Earl died. \u2018Then you understand that you marry the man and the house,\u2019 she says today. While her husband runs the estate, the jolly, sporty 52-year-old has become the face and force of the real Downton, in charge of monetising the legacy from the popular TV show. In this, she has been enormously successful, writing two best-selling books about previous Carnarvon wives; Almina and Catherine. Lady Carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme, much like Dame Maggie's Dowager Countess of Grantham . She also gives talks all over the world. In Texas next month, the socialite Lynn Wyatt is hosting a champagne Highclere Tea where Texan fans of Downton can meet the countess over cake, all for the price of a \u00a3440 ticket. She is quite the draw, happy to take on the ambassadorial role while her husband stays in the background. Right on cue, Lord Carnarvon appears in his Dad jeans and trainers, coffee mug in hand. Seeing that the morning room where we are talking is occupied, he quietly reverses out the door, like a dog in a Crufts obedience trial. \u2018He is very shy,\u2019 his wife explains. No one, least of all the couple themselves, imagined that Downton Abbey would be so successful. Now screened in more than 100 countries, it brings Americans and Chinese visitors here in droves. \u2018Who would have thought an Edwardian drama beginning in 1912 would have such huge appeal?\u2019 she wonders. Who indeed, but shooting began this week on the sixth Downton series. \u2018I am sure they would like to go on making more series,\u2019 she says. ITV director Peter Fincham has told her that he wants Downton to go on for 18 years. \u2018That made me gulp.\u2019 The money that flows into the Highclere coffers as a result of the series must surely, however, cushion the blow of domestic disruption. After all, before Downton hit our screens, the Carnarvons admitted that their estate needed \u00a311.75 million of repairs, including \u00a31.8 million of urgent work on the main house. Although the family will not say how much money they get for the rental of the castle for filming, Lord Carnarvon has since said the show had \u2018taken the pressure off\u2019 them financially. There is also talk of a Hollywood film, which Lady C does not deny. \u2018I try not to lie awake at night worrying about money,\u2019 she says. \u2018Obviously, like everyone else, I have a sense of complete panic every so often. I am not in a position where I have so much money I worry about what to do with it.\u2019 On sleepless nights, she roams the Highclere corridors, and likes to sleep in her son\u2019s bed when he is at boarding school. She soothes herself by listening to the Shipping Forecast on Radio 4, feeling grateful that she is not \u2018alone in a boat on the ocean\u2019. Lady Carnarvon first met her husband at a dinner party where they bonded over a love of World War I poetry. Her former lover, an eccentric cove called Sir Benjy Slade, had sued her for the return of a pet labrador and claimed she was \u2018the ruthless golddigger of the year\u2019. Highclere Castle, the English stately home in Hampshire, provides the ravishing setting for Downton Abbey . It\u2019s far more likely that the Carnarvons were two slightly broken people who made each other complete. He had recently separated from his first wife and two young children; she was grieving over the early death of both her parents. They married in February 1999 and had their son Edward in October; a honeymoon baby for a gilded life. It is to her credit that she does all her work on Highclere in the full knowledge that it is her husband\u2018s son, not hers, who will inherit the Carnarvon title and all the lands. Edward gets nothing, but that does not bother her. \u2018I am not worried. If I make some money from books, that is his. In life it is not what you take, it is what you give that matters most.\u2019 She and Geordie appear to have a healthy working partnership, one that she describes as \u201850/50 with a one per cent swing either way.\u2019 They eat breakfast, lunch and dinner together every day and never get tired of each other. Heaven for them is supper on a tray in front of the television. Her transition from confident and capable young woman to countess is fascinating. \u2018I would hate to be considered snobbish,\u2019 she says, although she learned, in the upper class way, to use charm as a weapon to get what she wants. \u2018You could walk into somewhere like Highclere and just stand like a petrified creature in the headlights, doing nothing. Or you could take it one step at a time. It is the end, not the journey, that matters.\u2019 A journey that sometimes takes in some aggravating neighbours along the way. \u2018I am a woman,\u2019 she says, \u2018who knows which battles to fight.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nmatthew crawley asked lady mary to marry him in the first downton abbey christmas.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as \u2018a unique moment in anyone\u2019s life\u2019. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince\u2019s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne\u2019s frustrations is the so-called \u2018Middletonisation\u2019 of his son William\u2019s life \u2014 specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole\u2019s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called \u2018March of the Middletons\u2019 that he has complained to friends: \u2018They never let me see my grandson.\u2019 Adds a source: \u2018Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.\u2019 It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles\u2019s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it\u2019s a deliberate move on William\u2019s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles\u2019s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate\u2019s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot\u2019s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William\u2019s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

Thanks to the European Space Agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft. The amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans, and others that are simply as they originally sounded. The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip. It took off from French Guiana at 9.46pm GMT on Friday 27 March (pictured), carrying two satellites that will expand Europe\u2019s Galileo system . The various noises from space are shared on Esa's\u00a0esaops Soundcloud page. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended. According to Esa they \u2018give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board Huygens would have heard during one minute of the descent through Titan's atmosphere.\u2019 With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn\u2019t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's \u2018water\u2019 is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe (illustrated) as it descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended . Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz. The \u2018music\u2019 was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible. Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko (pictured), as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz . The landing of Philae on the surface of 67P on 12 November 2014 is also heard in a brief clip, which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown. Philae subsequently bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest in an unknown location, wedged under a cliff somewhere in partial darkness. Scientists at Esa are hoping that the probe will wake up in the coming weeks as sunlight recharges its batteries, letting them perform more key science on the surface. Philae's first landing on the surface, seen here as pictured from the Rosetta spacecraft, can be heard in a short clip. The probe then bounced twice before coming to rest in an unknown location . The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip. It took off from French Guiana at 9.46pm GMT on Friday 27 March, carrying two satellites that will expand Europe\u2019s Galileo system - a civilian-run analogue to the US-run Global Positioning System (GPS).

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\n(CNN)Hillary Clinton's lawyerly news conference Tuesday, at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business was improper, might extinguish the matter for most Americans -- but it doesn't get Clinton out of the woods politically. The real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This is the multibillion-dollar foundation Hillary Clinton leads alongside ex-President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. What we already know about the foundation's donors is controversial: Some of the corporations, banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of American law. The Clintons can make a plausible case that it's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty. As Bill Clinton recently told reporters: \"You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\" It's an interesting and important debate, and most Americans would probably approve the idea of putting \"bad\" money to good use.  But the argument only works if Clinton's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation's tip-toeing around ethical challenges. To figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the William J. Clinton Foundation shortly after he left office in 2001.  Different initiatives were added over the years to combat AIDS, climate change, poverty and other ills; the most high-profile of these projects, the Clinton Global Initiative, added in 2005, brings world leaders together to tackle the world's problems. To make things even more complicated, the foundation's website says its mission is supported by the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas, which includes an archive of the President's papers. The foundation recently co-sponsored a Black History month event with the center. The foundation's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand. And with 350 employees spread across 180 nations, running the foundation is an expensive proposition: in 2012, the various initiatives spent $214 million according to The New York Times but still ended up $8 million in the red. Who gave, and why, is hard to figure out. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The Clinton Foundation does disclose its donors, which isn't required by law. But the disclosure is limited; dates and exact amount of the donations aren't disclosed. Donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name.\" Hillary and Bill Clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation. During Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state, the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative split off from the larger Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. Hillary Clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the State Department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department's ethics office. It was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title. Ideally that would settle the matter, but there's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that \"at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,\" raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state. In one well-publicized case, Hillary pressed a state-owed Russian airline to buy American planes from Boeing. The effort worked: Boeing ended up with a $3.7 billion contract. (To be sure, secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase American products. It's part of their job.) But weeks after Clinton's persuasion (what she called a \"shameless pitch\"), Boeing donated $900,000 to the foundation. A CNN investigation by Alexandra Jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the Clinton Foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and/or its CGI spinoff as a way to gain favor with the Clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations. In 2012, the British bank Standard Chartered paid $667 million in fines for violating sanctions against Iran and HSBC paid $1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank. Both banks have been major contributors to the foundation. As Jaffe notes, \"the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the foundation placed on its fundraising operation.\" And according to The Washington Post, seven nations donated millions to the foundation during Clinton's time as secretary of state, including a $500,000 gift from Algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the State Department's ethics office. That sort of corner-cutting, and the cozy-seeming connections between Clinton and various corporations and governments, will be tough to explain on the campaign trail. If emails suggest Clinton was aware of the corporations, banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the State Department -- or worse, took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign. It's much too early to count Hillary out, of course. The Clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars' worth of good works, from lowering the price of HIV-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women. But there's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the U.S. government while she was in office. What will matter is not why or how Hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nhillary clinton's lawyerly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server might extinguish the matter.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, punched charity worker Glynis Bensley, 47,\u00a0in the head and stamped on her  before stealing her money, phone and jewellery. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in\u00a0September last year. The child robber stood trial alongside Zoheb Majid, 20, from Smethwick, who was found guilty of robbery and manslaughter. A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard\u00a0he left a shoe print on her face (pictured is the scene in\u00a0Smethwick) A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder. Mrs Bensley was on her way home from the Seven Stars when she was knocked to the ground by the schoolboy. CCTV footage revealed that  Majid arrived on his bicycle moments later and the pair turned their victim over, stealing from her pockets. A post-mortem examination of Ms Bensley revealed she died from a severe bleed on the brain. After the attack, the schoolboy fled to nearby Victoria Park to meet up with friends and was heard boasting about the murder and\u00a0selling a gold bracelet. Both robbers claimed they believed the victim was a man because of Ms Bensley's clothing and hairstyle. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year . 'They were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'The brutal attack was captured on CCTV lasting 32 seconds. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis' family at this time and we hope that today's verdict will provide some help in their grieving process.' Ms Bensley's sister Dawn, 55, from Smethwick, said: 'We are a very close and supportive family and always look out for each other. 'To try and explain how Glynis' murder has affected us is very hard to put into words. 'Glynis was my only sister and best friend. I would describe her as my right arm and I thought we would grow old together.' A full statement from the victim's family read: 'We as individuals and collectively as a family have lost a great friend. 'We are unable to express in words the impact that our loss is having on our family. 'Whilst we get on with the day-to-day trivialities of life, the circumstances of Glynis' death remind us all of the important things in life. 'At the time of Glynis' death she was upbeat and looking forward to family holidays and celebrations including her own birthday later that month. 'Glynis spent her life caring for others working in roles for the British Heart Foundation, animal welfare, and was also an active fundraiser for charity's Cancer Research, Mencap and Cystic Fibrosis.

Andrew Chan and\u00a0Myuran Sukumaran\u00a0were convicted of being ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the  island's airport for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin to Australia. They have been on death row since 2005 and have now been transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed this week. Chan's mother Helen and brother Michael were today pictured at\u00a0Yogyakarta airport as they made their way to the island via boat from Cilacap in central Java. They were accompanied by Sukumaran's mother Raji and sister Brintha, although it is not known whether they will be allowed to see the men as hoped tomorrow when visits are usually banned. Scroll down for videos . The family of condemned Australian drug smuggler Andrew Chan, his mother Helen (centre) and brother Michael (wearing pink shorts) arrive at Yogyakarta airport on Thursday to make the five-hour drive to Cilacap in central Java and take a boat to Nusakambangan island where Chan is waiting to be executed . Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji (right) and sister Brintha (centre) on the tarmac at Yogyakarta, the closest main airport to the port town of Cilacap to which they will drive on Thursday afternoon . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja tried to visit Chan and Sukuraman on the island of Nusakambangan . Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia that prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan today. Earlier, a 'chilling' picture emerged of an Indonesian police chief posing with a smile on his face next to Chan on the flight to the island. In the photograph, Djoko Hariutomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, grins as he stands with his hand on the shoulder of the convicted drug smuggler. In another picture, Hariutomo is seen with his hand on the shoulder of another condemned Australian, Myuran Sukumaran, on the same flight who gazed up at him as the camera flashed. Amnesty\u2019s UK Director Kate Allen described the images as disturbing. She told MailOnline: 'The pictures of guards smiling while escorting their prisoners to Indonesia\u2019s so-called \"Execution Island\" are chilling.' A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand on the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan on a plane taking him to 'Death Island' Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight . The planned executions of Sukumaran, 33, and Chan, 31, have caused diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Australia to fray. The pair are among a group of up to 11 convicts, mostly foreigners, due to be executed on the prison island of Nusakambangan. Chan and Sukumaran were convicted in 2005 as the ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the holiday island's main airport for trying to smuggle 8kg (18lb) of heroin to Australia. The seven other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed in Indonesia. On Thursday, Indonesia rejected an Australian proposal for a prisoner swap made in an 11th hour effort to save the lives of Sukumaran and Chan. Indonesia's foreign ministry said there was no legal basis for Indonesia to act on the proposal that had been made by Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Last place on earth: This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells . 'Basically Indonesia does not have any regulation or legal framework regarding a prisoner swap,' said Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir. 'This idea was put forward to our minister two days ago and we told them then.' Australian politicians held a candlelight dawn vigil outside parliament house in support of the men early on Thursday, when Bishop said she had spoken to Indonesia's foreign minister earlier this week. 'I raised the fact that there were Indonesian prisoners in Australian jails and whether there was an opportunity for us to consider a prisoner swap, a prisoner transfer or a clemency plea in exchange for a return of prisoners,' Bishop said. 'I just asked for a pause in their preparations for the execution of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan so that we could have officials explore these ideas,' she told Sky News Australia. Australia does not have the death penalty and a recent survey by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute think tank showed nearly two-thirds of the public disapproved of the executions. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had asked to speak again with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday. This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time \u00a0on Sunday, January 18 . It is not known how the prisoners will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java . In an interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo said the men would be executed soon, but not this week. 'I am still convinced that the justice system in Indonesia, if you look at drug crime, is valid and based on facts and evidence,' he said. 'That's why when I rejected their clemency, I looked at their cases, how many drugs they were carrying.' Indonesia is expected to decide on the date for the executions in a few days, said Tony Spontana, spokesman for the attorney general's office. Widodo has adopted a tough stance against drug traffickers and others on death row, denying clemency appeals. Executions resumed in 2013 after a five-year gap and nationals from Brazil, Malawi, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Vietnam have been among those put in front of a firing squad. Meanwhile, an old school friend has revealed Andrew Chan never thought his impending execution would actually happen. The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application, Whatsapp. This weather beaten hut in Nirbaya or Death Valley sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in January and where the Australian Bali Nine duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad . Final journey: The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday following their final plane flight, from Bali to Cilacap in southern Java . 'Even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we're in the limelight - it'll cool down, it'll be alright,' Sami said. 'So I always said, 'yeah mate, definitely - you're in good hands'.' At least once during their exchange, Chan texted him 'all good bro'. Sami added Chan kept positive throughout the ordeal and said: 'I think he [Chan] was really expecting the Australian government to do a lot more.' The spot where the executions are due to take place is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan. Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. A school friend of Chan's (left), who went to Homebush Boys High with him (Chan pictured right as a student), told 9News the Australian had been calm and stayed positive up until yesterday about his impending execution . Sami and Chan had been exchanging text messages on Whatsapp (pictured) up until Tuesday night . At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south. The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out. They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner. Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali . This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad . In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner. When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution. A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place. Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthey have been transferred to nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Beleaguered travellers have been warned that \u2018Easter is cancelled\u2019 as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed. On others they face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. Worst affected will be the West Coast main line, where Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. Scroll down for video . Passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects (file picture) The West Coast mainline, the Great Western and the Greater Anglia line are all planning works on key routes meaning passengers will face hours on rail replacement services or slower routes . The line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will have a four-day shutdown. On Easter Sunday a 55-minute direct trip from Rugby to London Euston will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes, with two trains and two buses. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: \u2018Easter is effectively cancelled \u2013 our line is shut. We\u2019re advising people not to travel. \u2018What makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering. This is unusual.\u2019 Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a  report has found . Other services blighted by engineering works include London Midland, which uses the same West Coast line and has issued a similar warning, and swathes of the Great Western and Greater Anglia lines. Virgin services to Manchester and the North West and Birmingham are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised for disruption from the \u00a3100million works by 14,000 engineering workers, but insisted it was vital. However, the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at Christmas when the key East Coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works, prompting a major inquiry, damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs, and a grovelling apology from rail bosses. Cancellations: The report found that\u00a0when work near King's Cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at Finsbury Park station but 'not enough was done' to manage passenger flow at the new station . Under a large headline on its website, Virgin Trains warns passengers of the impending Easter chaos with the words: \u2018There\u2019s a spanner in the works. Don\u2019t get caught in planned improvement works.\u2019 It said there would not be any trains to or from London Euston, adding: \u2018There won\u2019t be any replacement shuttles either, so finding an alternative train service to London will be very difficult.\u2019 Engineering works on the line between Crewe and Warrington and from Carlisle to Glasgow will \u2018severely reduce services to the North and Scotland\u2019, it said. Services are also likely to be \u2018extra busy the day before and after affected days\u2019 and passengers should book early. West Coast passengers also face major works at Watford Junction from an \u00a381million programme from Network Rail \u2018to improve the ageing infrastructure\u2019. Rail bosses say carrying out works during Christmas and Easter is justified as passenger numbers are down by up to 40 per cent because there are far fewer commuters. But ministers have suggested carrying out such works at times other than at Christmas and Easter \u2013 such as through the summer \u2013 to avoid hitting families travelling during the key holiday periods. Mr Carne said: \u2018We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays to reunite with their friends and families, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period, but there will be disruption for some.\u2019 He insisted that there were \u2018good contingency plans in place\u2019 while the improvements are carried out.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbeleaguered travellers warned that 'easter is cancelled' as far as trains.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

In doing so, he has ignored the regimes' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and U.S. national security. This month brought familiar news: more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator Bashar al-Assad against his fellow Syrians. Just in June, the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-Assad's chemical weapons, which had been prompted by his August 2013 sarin attacks on Syrian civilians and the threat of U.S. airstrikes in response. The deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-Assad's chemical weapons arsenal, which he can no longer use to threaten Syrians and Israel or fall into terrorist hands. However, with his actions as evidence, it was a deal that al-Assad likely knew he could manipulate. Even while the deal was underway, al-Assad continued to attack Syrian civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. The deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-Assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. Just weeks after claiming success, the administration quietly acknowledged that al-Assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons. Al-Assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities, as the agreement required. The deal made al-Assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly, mass atrocities he continued to commit. During implementation, the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition. About 50,000 more Syrians were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of Syrians throughout the region continued. Meanwhile, ISIS further exploited the civil war, expanding into security voids. There are several troubling parallels between the administration's deal with al-Assad and the one it is now pursuing with Tehran. Both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally na\u00efve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating. In both cases, the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and al Qaeda -- which these regimes have funded, trained or sheltered. All of this was true before the administration started these negotiations, and it remains true today. Neither Tehran nor al-Assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community. To the contrary, external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-Assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and Tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions. Both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay, obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements. As continues to be the case with al-Assad, Tehran has been emboldened by the administration's approach. It has increased lethal support to al-Assad in Syria, deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in Iraq, and ramped up aid to other militant groups, including the insurgent Houthis in Yemen. These activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that Iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in Iraq and Syria. As was the case with al-Assad, a deal will effectively make Tehran a partner to the administration in which the White House accepts the Iranian regime's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement. And there will still be little confidence that Tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts. Even while negotiations have been underway, Iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology. The regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency's access to others, including its infamous Parchin base. As IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano confirmed again this week, Tehran has still only partially answered one of the IAEA's long-standing, 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities. Amid his continued calls for \"death to America,\" Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal, not as a result of verified observance of a deal. Tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief. Without a complete understanding of Iran's program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a na\u00efve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life. We are seeing it once again in response to the administration's efforts with Iran. As we learned with Syria's al-Assad, making a deal with a terrorist-supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road. Let's not make that mistake twice.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nobama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The British No 1 went down 6-2, 6-3 in 88 minutes to his direct contemporary on Saturday in the latest match of what has begun to look like a one-sided rivalry. The 27 year-old Serb\u2019s victory not only put him into the final of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, it also represented his ninth victory out of 10 against Murray, the exception being the 2013 Wimbledon final. British No1 Andy Murray crashes out of BNP Paribas semi-final at Indian Wells after losing to Novak Djokovic . Murray plays a shot during his semi-final match against Djokovic in Indian Wells on Saturday . Djokovic celebrates his win over Murray that sees the Serb progress to the final of the BNP Paribas Open . Djokovic and Murray meet at the net following their quick semi-final in California on Saturday . And Murray said: \u2018The frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets. Novak didn\u2019t give me any free points at the beginning of either set and I made a few too many errors early on. \u2018At the end of both sets, I started to play a bit better and made it tougher and was able to push him a bit, but not enough at the beginning of the sets to make it challenging enough for him.\u2019 Djokovic was in sublime form and Murray\u2019s only chance appeared to be to serve outstandingly well, which he did not. On the kind of medium-slow hard court that is so commonplace on the ATP Tour the world No 1, when fully prepared and motivated, looks irresistible. Djokovic said: \u2018I tried to start with the right intensity, I got a crucial break at the start. Andy made a lot of unforced errors, his first-serve percentage was low. I\u2019m sure he knows I\u2019m returning well, I know he\u2019s returning well, so that puts added pressure on our serving.\u2019 Murray's caoch Amelie Mauresmo watches on from the stands in Indian Wells . Djokovic will play either Roger Federer or Milos Raonic in the final on Sunday . There was nothing in the way of the aggravation that marked their last meeting, the Australian Open final, where Murray looked like he was getting the upper hand before his opponent started hamming up his physical state and the Scot became distracted. That was part of what has been, by and large, a decent start to the season for Murray, but his problem remains that Djokovic plays in a similar fashion to him and does it decisively better. Murray had been in impressive form over the past 10 days while Djokovic enjoyed a walkover in his scheduled quarter-final against Bernard Tomic. And Djokovic will now face Roger Federer in Sunday's final after the Swiss came through his semi-final against Rafa Nadal\u2019s conqueror, Miles Raonic. Federer beat the Canadian 7-5, 6-4, finally finding the break he needed in the 11th game of the first set. He clinched the opener with a forehand winner, then broke Raonic\u2019s serve again at the start of the second set. Raonic, enticed to the net repeatedly by Federer only to see power strokes whizz past him, struggled against Federer\u2019s serve and the world No 2 completed the victory with a volley at the net.

Andressa Urach, 27, had to have toxic substances drained from her body after her bottom fillers 'rotted', triggering a life-threatening infection. The model admitted she brought her health woes on herself after 'my vanity made me push the limits.' Andressa Urach is pictured in hospital this week having life-saving treatment after her buttock implants triggered an infection . The model had to have a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body . Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo earlier this week, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek. Without medical intervention, the infection could have been fatal. She is now recovering after having a a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body. New pictures have been released of her during and after this unpleasant procedure as she hopes other women will learn from her experience and avoid having surgery in the pursuit of\u00a0perfection. Andressa was first hospitalised last year thanks to cosmetic procedures going wrong . 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' the mother-of-one admitted earlier this week. Despite making a living off her\u00a0voluminous\u00a0bottom, she said she's now happy to have a less\u00a0curvaceous\u00a0rear if it\u00a0means she can survive. She said: 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' Of her hospital stay she admitted: 'It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits' Her voluminous rear used to be her most prized asset but now she said she'd rather it's smaller if it means she'll be healthier . Earlier today, the reality TV posted a picture of herself on Instagram recovering\u00a0in her\u00a0hospital\u00a0bed with her hands making\u00a0a\u00a0heart sign as she thanked fans for their support and get well wishes. 'Small gestures of affection make a difference! In the most difficult moments of our lives, we can see who really are our friends,' she wrote. Prior to her brush with death, Miss Urach - who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - had been an\u00a0advocate\u00a0of cosmetic\u00a0surgery. She had reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. The model pictured earlier this month during an interview with Dailymail.com after her legs were infected . Andressa, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition, has revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery after wounds in her thigh were infected . She spent a month in intensive care and reportedly feared she would lose her leg . This graphic photos show gaping holes in Andressa's thighs, all in the name of beauty . She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care. At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. After making a recovery from that incident, she was then rushed back to hospital last weekend with another infection cause by her buttock implants. She underwent another emergency operation to remove a combination of Pmma and hydrogel and is now being treated with antibiotics through a catheter and will soon begin physiotherapy. Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied. Andressa featured in the Miss BumBum contest in 2012 and claimed she slept with Cristiano Ronaldo . Pain: Miss Urach when her legs began hurting last year (left) and, right, in better spirits in her hospital bed . She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. 'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. 'We were slaves to beauty.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe model had to have a combination of pmma and hydrogel removed.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Gabby Giffords. The Army veteran died Wednesday morning of pneumonia, according to his wife, Sallie Badger. He was 78 years old. Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived.\u00a0Loughner is serving seven consecutive life terms in prison. Remembered: In this November 8, 2012 file photo, Bill Badger points his hand in the shape of a gun as he describes the events of the day Jared Loughner killed six people and wounded 13 others, following Loughner's sentencing to life in prison at U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona . Shooting: Bill Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. A memorial plaque for the shootings is seen on January 8, 2014 . Giffords, who lives in Tucson, said she was sad to learn of Badger's death. She said in a statement 'I'm so sad to learn that Bill Badger has passed away. Bill was not only a great man and a proud Army veteran, he was a hero. On January 8, 2011, Bill was wounded in the head by a bullet from the gun of my would-be assassin. Not even pausing to realize he had been injured, Bill ran towards the shooter and towards danger so that he could help subdue him until the authorities arrived. I believe that Bill helped save lives that morning. And I will always be grateful to him for his selfless, brave actions. 'My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with Bill's loved ones as they mourn the loss of a great man.' Shooter: Jared Loughman is now serving seven consecutive life terms in prison . Rep. Ron Barber also released a statement, which said in part 'The label \"hero\" an be overused, but Bill was undoubtedly one of the true heroes when a gunman opened fire at the shopping center on January 8, 2011. Although he had been grazed by a bullet and was bleeding from his head, Bill disregarded his own well-being and joined two others to stop the gunman. 'Six people died that day and 13 others of us were wounded \u2014 but the toll would have been much higher had not Bill taken fast action when the gunman paused to reload. I will forever be grateful for his bravery and the lives he saved.' Sallie Badger said it came as no surprise that her husband had risked his life to help others. The retired Army colonel had spent his entire life doing just that, she said. 'Bill was a hero to many, many people long before he became a hero on Jan. 8. He was very influential in many, many young lives in many ways,' Sallie Badger said. She said Badger was highly involved in the life of their 25-year-old son, Christian Badger. Badger also guided young men into the military and other careers, she said. Bill Badger hailed from South Dakota. He joined the National Guard as a high school junior and went on to have a long, distinguished career as an Army pilot for 37 years. The couple moved to Arizona in 1985 when Bill Badger established the Western Army Aviation Training Site in Marana, just outside of Tucson. On January 9, 2011, Badger told\u00a0KOLD 'The shooting stopped and I raised up and didn't realize it, but he was right beside me. Right in front of me. And I got to my feet and one of the individuals who was there to see her was on the other side of the walkway, you know, right where he was walking and that individual took a folding chair, folded it and hit him on the back of the head and he moved his head forward so much of the blunt of it came right on the shoulders of his back and when they did that his left arm came out and it was my opportunity. 'I grabbed his left arm and started to twist it back and grabbed him on the shoulder with my right hand another individual grabbed his right hand and together we pushed on him and he went right down on the sidewalk. 'I had a hold of his throat and the guy on the other side had his knee right on the back of his neck, and every time he would struggle, I would squeeze his throat and the guy would put pressure on the back of his neck.' Badger was not permanently injured from the bullet that grazed the back of his head, but he showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, his wife said. The couple embarked on a three-year journey across the country to push for stricter gun laws. 'We wanted desperately to have background checks on every gun that was sold,' Sallie Badger said. 'And Bill just made that his mission.' Assassination: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is seen in this January 5, 2011 file photo - three days before the shooting took place . In this image released by the Pima County Sheriff's department, police notes, including naming Jared Loughner as a suspect and detailing weapons found at the scene, are seen scrawled on the trunk of a police vehicle during the aftermath of the Tucson shooting rampage .

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far \u2014 and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship \u2014 Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . \u2018Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\u2019 said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. \u2018Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. \u2018At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. \u2018We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.\u2019 Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker\u00a0Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England\u2019s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster\u2019s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England\u2019s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: \u2018We don\u2019t control it. It\u2019s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.\u2019 England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons.

Mrs Jarvis, who lives in the nearby village of Farnham Royal, said most of Freya\u2019s friends have been allocated places at a school in the town of Beaconsfield. \u2018We\u2019re a practising Christian family and while we aren\u2019t wanting her to go to a Christian school, my daughter should not be expected to attend a Sikh school,\u2019 said Mrs Jarvis. \u2018We knew we were ever so slightly out of the catchment for a number of our first choices but we never thought we would be given Khalsa. \u2018In this day and age I could not imagine ever sending my child to a school where she would become a minority. 'Although it\u2019s open to all, each day they take students off for morning prayers and my daughter would not be doing that, and she would, therefore, be taken out and isolated.

The school intends to cater for students from all backgrounds, with \u201850 per cent of places prioritised for non-Sikh students\u2019. Plans to open the school were put forward by Slough Sikh Education Trust in 2013. Khalsa Primary School was already open in Slough, which is just across the border in Berkshire and has a large Sikh population. But the trust said there was no suitable site for the new school in Slough.

But from a very young age, the youngster from Los Angeles knew it simply wasn't the case. The transgender 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two, setting his physical 'parts' aside. Writing for CNN, he has described how he knew he was male long before he discovered the terms 'gay' and 'sexuality', and the difficulty he encountered with other people's perceptions growing up. He also urges parents to let children set out their path - no matter their gender. Avery Wallace (right) poses for a picture with his sister Riley in 2002 at the age of three. He claims he knew he was a boy when he was two . His parents let him cut his hair short for his preschool graduation, even though he was wearing a dress . Describing life as a toddler, he said: 'I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind - not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. 'No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part.' He said he first heard the term 'gay' in second grade, even after he had his first 'girlfriend', and remembered how one year 'a penis' was at the top of his Christmas list. However he feared people may perceive him as 'different' when he learned homosexuality was considered by some to be abnormal. 'I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay - but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.' At the age of seven he started to prefer wearing boys clothes and by eight, he was playing baseball . Avery was elected class president in the fifth grade by his peers. He strongly stated that he was a boy\u00a0and the 'people that mattered knew it too, for the most part' He is pictured at age 10 with short, curly hair. By now he was living the life of a boy, but the word transgender hadn't formed part of his vocabulary . Avery described how he was able to become the boy he wanted, because he grew up in a house that taught him to 'love anyone I wanted to.' 'That said,' he added. 'I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either.' When he entered middle school, he grew out his hair and started to wear dresses as to avoid the 'emotional torture'. But in 2012, when he was 12, he told his parents he was transgender. He is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment after attending a number of group sessions, and has urged people to consider categorizing people into boys and girls more carefully. 'I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight,' Avery said. He added: 'Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was.' Avery wore a suit and lavender waistcoat for his fifth grade graduation, but from then on he grew out his hair and some times wore a dress to avoid the 'emotional torture' of middle school . In 2012 he told his parents he was transgender and is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Competing in the workplace, caring for aging parents and trying teenagers, and busier than ever, we use anything we can to duct-tape our lives and ourselves together: comfort foods, alcohol, energy drinks, and an expanding array of antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, painkillers and amphetamines. All in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace. Welcome to the increasingly altered states of America. Americans are about 5% of the world's population, yet we take half its pills, and 80% of its painkillers.This over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting, according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager, Medco. This is creating a \"new normal,\" bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance. Like steroids in baseball, when everyone starts doing it, the players who don't are at a disadvantage. The overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology, and it's like cosmetic surgery: as more women get breast implants, the rest of us feel flat chested. But the new normal isn't normal at all. Certain antidepressants called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin, the brain chemical that helps regulate mood, which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity, while higher doses can engender apathy. Women are naturally moody. Our moods change, and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient. We are dynamic and responsive to our environment. There is a biological advantage to this sensitivity; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need, what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings. Moodiness -- being sensitive, caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power. It helps to ensure not only our survival, but that of our offspring. Women's emotionality is a sign of health, not disease, and it is our single biggest psychological asset. Yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising. Nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.Steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from \"Should I take an antidepressant?\" to \"Which one should I take?\" These medications can have more far-reaching effects than most people realize, blunting empathy, passion, and sensitivity. SSRIs dampen sexual desire and response, making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners. SSRIs also make it hard to cry, an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong. Tears, and the emotions beneath them, can offer a profound lesson in how people's behavior affects others. We cry when we're touched by the poignancy of humanity, or when we're angry, or frustrated by injustice. And yet, women apologize for their tears, especially in the workplace, where we've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward-momentum, and it makes people uncomfortable. The problem with shutting it down is that we're stifling a piece that we need, that our partners and families need, and that society needs, particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government. The world needs more compassion, sensitivity, intuition and empathy. War, rape, murder, and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence. Change comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong. Sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated. Anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions, from their repression. My patients want to feel better, but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling. The shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women, who, by their biology, are the last and much needed connection to this natural place. As we embrace new technologies, we need to be careful that we don't go too far away from nature and what's natural for us as social primates. We insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners. Why don't we insist on natural moods for ourselves? If we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us, we will be calmer, more at peace and more fulfilled. But we are drowning in artificiality. There is a \"plastic vortex\" of garbage the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean, synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces, virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants. We compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction, because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough. We need a course correction, away from the synthetic, so that we can live lives that honor how we feel. But to do that, we must be able to feel, to be our moody, authentic selves. That is the first step to wellness and to wholeness. Medicating yourself into complacency may leave you unshaken, but it also may leave you unfeeling and apathetic, making it impossible to address the causes of your pain.

And now, she has been sensationally cleared, alongside her ex-boyfriend,\u00a0Raffaele Sollecito, of the murder of her former roommate, Meredith Kercher, who was found dead in Italy seven years ago. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas and Mr Sutherland, Knox, 27, broke down in tears as she addressed the press following Italy's Supreme Court's ruling on Friday night. Scroll down for video . Free: Amanda Knox (seen addressing the media alongside her fiance, Colin Sutherland, left, on Friday after she was sensationally cleared of murder) has tried to lead a normal life over the past three-and-a-half years . Engaged: She has graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in creative writing and become engaged to Sutherland, a musician. Above, Knox with Sutherland outside her mother's house on Thursday . Placing her hands over her chest, she said: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' The former inmate added that she is 'so grateful to have my life back'. In December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the brutal murder and sexual assault of Kercher, a British student. They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively. However, after they had already served four years in prison, an appeals court in Perugia - where the student was discovered dead - threw out the couple's conviction and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US, before another U-turn in the case saw a court in Florence reinstate her original 2009 conviction and increase her sentence to 28-and-a-half years in January 2014.

The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug. He has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes. The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug (file image above) Just last month he attended the party\u2019s high-profile donors\u2019 ball, and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of Government policies. But despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him, he has now admitted \u2013 behind closed doors \u2013 to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis. His consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day \u2013 because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much. And remarkably \u2013 despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years \u2013 the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction. However he is not shy about appearing in the public eye. He always seems full of energy when caught on camera, and has been very talkative with journalists. He has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business, putting many details about his life into the public domain. The addict has also spoken out against Labour policies and in favour of the Conservative Government \u2013 including for moves which benefited him financially. Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball attended by David and Samantha Cameron in 2007 (above) The donor refused to comment, however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction, a source close to him said: \u2018There\u2019s a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified. \u2018He is not a well man. He\u2019s trying to sort it out and sort himself out. He definitely doesn't want to talk about it at this stage.\u2019 Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball \u2013 a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich. The most recent ball \u2013 at the Grosvenor House Hotel on exclusive Park Lane \u2013 attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders. Tables for ten at the February event cost up to \u00a315,000 each, while the minimum price for a single ticket was \u00a3500. Dinner was scheduled to go on for three-and-a-half hours with speeches by Mr Cameron and the Conservative chairman Lord Feldman. Guests could bid to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May, have a cup of tea with Boris Johnson, go for a 10km run with Iain Duncan Smith, or have a week in a luxury chalet in Switzerland. In the final big fundraiser ahead of the general election, \u00a3210,000 was spent on a bronze bust of Margaret Thatcher and \u00a3220,000 was bid for a week-long holiday in a Spanish fortress. One of the paying guests forked out \u00a3110,000 at the auction for a single night\u2019s exclusive use of Annabel\u2019s nightclub. But a major cocaine abuser was also among them, rubbing shoulders not just with hedge fund managers and oil tycoons, but also with major party figures \u2013 including Chief Whip Michael Gove, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

Above, a rare 1822 Half Eagle five-dollar gold piece, one of only three known to exist. The rare five-dollar gold piece and a prized silver dollar each could fetch $10 million or more in upcoming auctions . An 1822 Half Eagle five-dollar gold piece, one of only three . known to exist, and an 1804 Silver Dollar dubbed the 'King of . American Coins' are expected to be among the top lots when the . collection is sold in a series of auctions in New York beginning . in May and continuing into 2017. 'These two coins in particular, we think, have a possibility . of being up around that $10 million mark,' Brian Kendrella, the . president of Stack's Bowers Galleries, told Reuters. The rare coin and currency auctioneer, which is handling the . sales with Sotheby's, believes the coins could shatter the $10 . million record set in 2013 for a 1794 Silver Dollar. Although jaw-dropping prices for contemporary art grabbed . headlines in 2014, rare coins also had a banner year and are . among the biggest collectibles behind art and antiques. A 200-year-old Silver Dollar dubbed the'\"King of American Coins,' is seen in an undated handout photo courtesy of PCGS . Coin sales are driven by the economy, but Kendrella said . investors and collectors are also lured by the rarity, . uniqueness, condition and historical links of coins. 'They are artifacts that speak to what was going on in the . United States at the time these coins were made,' he said. 'That's one of the main draws.' With a dozen coins selling for $1 million or more in 2014 . and the first gold coin struck for the United States fetching . $4.5 million, the nonprofit Professional Numismatists Guild . estimates the overall U.S. rare coin market to be worth about $5 . billion. Walter Husak, a retired aerospace entrepreneur based in . California, knows just how lucrative it can be. A collection of . 301 rare penny coins dating from 1793 to 1814 that he gathered . over more than 13 years sold in 2008 for $10.7 million, about . double what he invested in it. 'I never thought it would go up that much,' he said. 'There . are a lot of people getting involved in coins.' Barry Stuppler, secretary of the Professional Numismatists . Guild, has seen plenty of changes in his 52 years in the coin . business, with buyers increasing in recent years. 'It is a combination of the economy coming back,' he said of . the market, 'and the fact that interest rates are very low.' The Internet also has been 'a tremendous, tremendous source . of new buyers and sellers of coins that we didn't have 20 years . ago,' said Stuppler. Demand for rare, investment-quality coins, graded and . certified by the guild and the Florida-based Numismatic Guaranty . Corporation, is high and supply is low.

But from a very young age, the youngster from Los Angeles knew it simply wasn't the case. The transgender 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two, setting his physical 'parts' aside. Writing for CNN, he has described how he knew he was male long before he discovered the terms 'gay' and 'sexuality', and the difficulty he encountered with other people's perceptions growing up. He also urges parents to let children set out their path - no matter their gender. Avery Wallace (right) poses for a picture with his sister Riley in 2002 at the age of three. He claims he knew he was a boy when he was two . His parents let him cut his hair short for his preschool graduation, even though he was wearing a dress . Describing life as a toddler, he said: 'I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind - not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. 'No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part.' He said he first heard the term 'gay' in second grade, even after he had his first 'girlfriend', and remembered how one year 'a penis' was at the top of his Christmas list. However he feared people may perceive him as 'different' when he learned homosexuality was considered by some to be abnormal. 'I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay - but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.' At the age of seven he started to prefer wearing boys clothes and by eight, he was playing baseball . Avery was elected class president in the fifth grade by his peers. He strongly stated that he was a boy\u00a0and the 'people that mattered knew it too, for the most part' He is pictured at age 10 with short, curly hair. By now he was living the life of a boy, but the word transgender hadn't formed part of his vocabulary . Avery described how he was able to become the boy he wanted, because he grew up in a house that taught him to 'love anyone I wanted to.' 'That said,' he added. 'I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either.' When he entered middle school, he grew out his hair and started to wear dresses as to avoid the 'emotional torture'. But in 2012, when he was 12, he told his parents he was transgender. He is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment after attending a number of group sessions, and has urged people to consider categorizing people into boys and girls more carefully. 'I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight,' Avery said. He added: 'Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was.' Avery wore a suit and lavender waistcoat for his fifth grade graduation, but from then on he grew out his hair and some times wore a dress to avoid the 'emotional torture' of middle school .

But police say they are satisfied no crime has been committed. The women had gone out for drinks in the city centre on Friday night with Ms Baker's boyfriend John Burton, 26, when they ended up at the Rose and Crown. 'We had been in the pub then we went outside then the next thing I remember\u00a0is our heads were banged together,' said Ms Baker.

And while the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns 10 years ago is still debated, the American hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill a fox.

Above, Knox with Sutherland outside her mother's house on Thursday . Placing her hands over her chest, she said: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' The former inmate added that she is 'so grateful to have my life back'. In December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the brutal murder and sexual assault of Kercher, a British student. They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively. However, after they had already served four years in prison, an appeals court in Perugia - where the student was discovered dead - threw out the couple's conviction and declared them innocent. Knox returned to the US, before another U-turn in the case saw a court in Florence reinstate her original 2009 conviction and increase her sentence to 28-and-a-half years in January 2014.

Clinton turned over to a House committee investigating the 2012 . attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, show her aides . sometimes used their personal email accounts to communicate with . her through her own private account. Clinton said during a March 10 press conference that 'the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.' That, she claimed then, 'meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department' for archiving, where they would turn up in searches conducted in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. But The New York Times reported on Monday that some of the approximately 300 Clinton emails examined by a congressional committee  suggest otherwise. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton could be waving goodbye to her presidential ambitions if 'email-gate' gets deeper. She spoke at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress on Monday . LOST TO HISTORY? Former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Huma Abedin (right) was one of her closest aides, and emailed Clinton in a conversation where both women used personal accounts . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . The emails from Clinton, a presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, do not prove the former . secretary of state ordered a 'stand down,' stopping U.S. forces . from responding to the Benghazi attack or participated in a related cover-up, the newspaper reported,  citing four senior . government officials. But they do raise new questions about how much of Clinton's correspondence has been lost to history. Federal record retention laws are designed to prevent the kind of archive side-stepping Clinton is accused of carrying on for the four years she led the State Department. Congress subpoenaed email records last week from 'close to a dozen' people who worked for Hillary Clinton at State. The Times report is the latest revelation in the saga over . Clinton and her use of a personal email address to conduct . government business, as well as a private computer server to . store that correspondence. PROBLEMS: Clinton has been dogged by allegations that she purposely hid incriminating emails from the State Department \u2013 and from public records requesters \u2013 by keeping all her emails on a private server . Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Times that Clinton's . aides primarily used their work email to correspond with her . about government matters, adding that 'only the tiniest fraction . of the more than 1 million emails they sent or received involved . their personal accounts.' According to the Times, she occasionally exchanged emails with at least four aides via personal accounts while she was . at the State Department, including her foreign policy adviser, . Jake Sullivan; chief of staff, Cheryl Mills; senior adviser, . Philippe Reines; and her personal aide, Huma Abedin. Abedin used an email address on Clinton's private server in addition to her official 'dot-gov' address. Mills reportedly did the same. Clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account, calling it a matter of 'convenience.' In one email exchange cited by the Times, she asked an aide to assess the performance of a top State official before Congress. 'Did we survive the day?' she wrote. 'Survive, yes,' the adviser responded. DAMAGE CONTROL? It's not clear what Clinton's inner circle said to her about her turn before the US Senate \u2013 the infamous 'What difference does it make?' moment \u2013 because the former secretary's emails were outside the State Department's archive system . In separate exchanges weeks later, Sullivan wrote Clinton to reassure her that she wouldn't be held to account in the same way as then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice, who falsely claimed on national television that the death and destruction in Benghazi was the consequence of a protest that spiraled out of control. 'She did make clear our view that this started spontaneously then evolved,' he wrote to Clinton at one point, seeming to reinforce the idea that the Obama administration planned to stick with that assessment.. Later, when the White House began referring to Benghazi as a 'terror attack,' Sullivan told Clinton that in her own publiccomments she had steered clear of the nettles that had snared Rice. 'You never said \u2018spontaneous\u2019 or characterized their motivations,' he wrote, according to the Times. Details on conversations like these are sketchy: The Times wasn't permitted to look at the emails, but relied on descriptions from four different sources. COULD IT BE? Housing secretary Julian Castro (right) has been talked about as a potential presidential candidate and would catch momentum if Hillary Clinton's email scandal derailed her campaign hopes . PROBE: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy chairs a special congressional committee looking into the Benghazi attacks, and has subpoenaed emails from 'close to a dozen' current and past Clinton aides . Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators . BECAUSE I'M HAPPY? Clinton is her party's presumed presidential front-runner, having come in second to Barack Obama in 2008 . A spokesman for the Republican-controlled House Select . Committee on Benghazi declined to comment, according to the . newspaper. Clinton has said she gave copies of all work-related emails . to the State Department, but Republicans, who see her as their . top target in the run-up to the 2016 election, continued to . press for more records. Last week Republicans asked the State Department to hand . over numerous documents related to Clinton's use of private . email while she was secretary of state and have called on her to . hand over her email server to a third party.

Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in.

They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven\u2019t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It\u2019s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there\u2019s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster\u2019s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 \u2014 and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity \u2014 but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi\u2019s absence hasn\u2019t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach\u2019s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster \u2014 compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O\u2019Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe\u2019s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don\u2019t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O\u2019Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach\u2019s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent\u2019s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He\u2019s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach\u2019s strengths? Warren Gatland\u2019s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him \u2014 the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I\u2019d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nstuart lancaster's fourth year in charge they are yet to win.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, from Paignton, Devon was stunned to discover a member of the public had reported him to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) - claiming someone that good at darts could not possibly be blind. 'Everything went OK. Then I got a letter from the DWP,' he explained. Scroll down for video . Visually impaired Robert Boon, 50, (pictured) from Paignton, Devon organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the \u00a310,000 training of two guide dogs . Mr Boon felt moved to raise the money for charity in memory of his recently deceased friends. A user of a guide dog himself, he knew how important they could be for individuals with impaired sight . Mr. Boon, who is registered blind as he is completely blind in one eye and only able to see shadows in the other, said: 'I rang them up because I couldn't read it, and they explained to me that someone had reported me because of the dart marathon. 'There were loads of people there, so it could have been someone at the event. 'I felt humiliated because I don't think it is right to report me when I have tried to do something good. 'I rang the hospital to get my medical records on my eye condition. I don't see why people should put me down. 'I feel really intimidated now. I am registered blind and can't see virtually anything out of one eye and shadows in the other. The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits. Mr. Boom organised a ten-hour darts marathon to raise funds for the \u00a310,000 training of two guide dogs who he wanted to name Mary and Wesley\u00a0after his recently deceased friends. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some accuracy . He scored 61,000 points and a maximum 180 with three darts. He played the game when he was younger . Having played darts for fun before he lost his sight, Robert decided the event was the best way to raise the cash. Throughout the day held at the Pond Coffee Shop in Paignton, Robert racked up 61,000 points and at one point a maximum 180 with three darts. Mr Boom explained that due to the repetitive action of dart throwing he was able to maintain some degree of accuracy. Mr. Boon stood his ground with the DWP but said he felt humiliated and intimidated by being accused of fraud . Mr. Boon felt the whole episode was unfair, especially considering he was trying to help people like him . He stepped up to the oche at 10am, and was throwing darts all day, with a five minute rest every hour, until nearly 9pm. Robert said: 'I've always had bad eyesight, I was never allowed to drive or even play football. The only sports I was allowed to do was judo or darts. 'Two of my friends passed away recently and I wanted to name guide dogs after them, so that their names could live on. 'I was watching TV a while back and saw a blind darts team, so I decided to give it a go. 'I knew the layout of the board, when you've been playing for ten hours straight you start to get a gauge for where things are on the board. The DWP have confirmed that after an investigation it does not intent to cut Robert's benefits . A spokesman for the Deparment for Work and Pensions said: 'It's only right that we investigate a person's benefit claim when we receive information that suggests they may not be entitled.' Mr Boon worked in the hotel business until he was diagnosed blind three years ago. He is married to his wife Donna, 52. and has one child by a previous relationship, Lauren, 11. He has said he will continue in his efforts to raise money for guide dog training, despite recent events. However, Robert said he had questioned whether he should go on after he received the letter from the DWP, theTorquay Herald Express\u00a0reported.

(HarperCollins \u00a318.99) Tom Jones has been a genuine global star for half a century. How many other people can say that? By my reckoning, it\u2019s no more than a handful: Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood and HM The Queen. And only one of them, I believe, lives in a larger house than Sir Tom\u2019s. Sir Tom Jones (pictured in Los Angeles in 1978) had his first No 1 in the UK in March 1965 . It was in March 1965 that his first hit, It\u2019s Not Unusual, went to No 1 in the UK and made him famous. To this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. Another significant milestone approaches on June 7, when he will turn 75 years old. All of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed, no-holds-barred hardback biography. Smith\u2019s is not the first \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the twelfth. But it\u2019s the first for nearly two years, and should keep us going until the autumn, when Sir Tom\u2019s autobiography is due out. What else will the great man be able to reveal, given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made? Tom (pictured in early 1970s) married his wife Linda in 1957 when they were both only 16-years-old . For Sir Tom has not lived a particularly secretive life. Though married to Linda, nee Trenchard, for 58 years, and happily so, he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life. But as long as Linda doesn\u2019t have to read about it in the newspaper \u2014 let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t read this \u2014 she turns a blind eye. It\u2019s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it. It\u2019s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it. Such opportunities would never have arisen, of course, without the talent. Jones was born with the gift of a golden voice, and he knows exactly what to do with it. This was apparent on his first hit, and has not wavered since. Tom Jones (pictured) was born\u00a0Thomas Woodward but was persuaded to change his name by his manager\u00a0Gordon Mills, who also persuaded the star to move to London from Wales . Quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but, under the watchful eye of his son, Mark, who has managed him since the mid-Eighties, he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans. Several generations, in fact. The backstory is well known. Babies hear it on their mothers\u2019 knees, and then tell it to their own babies many years later. Born Thomas Woodward in Treforest, South Wales, the infant Tom \u2018had an edge, even as a youngster in short trousers. He didn\u2019t just sing a song; he performed it with verve and passion\u2019. Aged 12, he lost a year at school through tuberculosis; at 16, he was married with a child on the way. \u2018Most of the girls found him very attractive,\u2019 said one schoolmate. \u2018He seemed a bit rough to me, but he definitely had the charisma. He had a way with him, a swagger.\u2019 Tom Jones (right) is pictured with his manager, Gordon Mills (left), in January 1969. Mills worked as the superstar's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986 . The climb from obscurity, though, was long and arduous. Tom was a member of a band called The Senators, who weren\u2019t going anywhere terribly fast. A sharp-eyed young manager, Gordon Mills, persuaded him to move to London, change his name to \u2018Tom Jones\u2019 and begin a solo career. He was already in his mid-20s. For 20 years, until Gordon died of cancer, Tom always deferred to his expertise. In return, Gordon did all Tom\u2019s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking. It was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly. Hits in the Sixties led to Las Vegas in the Seventies, and what might best be described as the Underwear Throwing Years. No bow-tie was larger or fluffier than Tom\u2019s, no hips swivelled more suggestively. Elvis was a good friend and was convinced Tom wore a sock down the front of his trousers. Tom knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them, though he didn\u2019t like it when John Lennon, with his characteristic Scouse wit, called him a \u2018Welsh poof\u2019. Would anyone? Tom (pictured) has been a judge on the Voice UK talent show since 2012, as has will.i.am (pictured) Nonetheless, an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when Tom recorded five consecutive country albums in the early Eighties. The live tours and Vegas residencies had made him hedge-fund rich. He and Linda lived in splendour in California, with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner. But was it making him happy? Well, yes, but at the same time, Tom clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier, rootsier music he had first loved. It hasn\u2019t been an entirely easy ride since then, but his last two studio albums, Praise & Blame (2010) and Spirit In The Room (2012), have been the best of his long career. What comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man. Other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises, when they have clearly had the lot done. Sir Tom Jones has also had the lot done \u2014 but cheerfully admits to it. He has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket, yet is generous with family and close friends, as you or I would be in his position. He doesn\u2019t like drugs or gambling, but enjoys a good cigar, and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good. Sir Tom (pictured), unlike many other celebrities, has admitted to having had plastic surgery work . Smith is an efficient chronicler of the life, as befits an old pro whose previous books have included Kylie, Gary (Barlow), Alesha (Dixon), Tulisa, Kate (Middleton), Cheryl and, of course, Victoria. There are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge: Leonard Cohen\u2019s song is called Tower Of Song, not Tower Of Strength, for instance, and he doesn\u2019t know that Burt Bacharach did not write the lyrics to his songs, which is a bit poor. But his book bounces along happily enough, forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every-thing and become universally adored. As Rob Brydon put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award: \u2018Tom Jones has lived the life we would all love to live.\u2019 I have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept, and Sir Tom probably sang It\u2019s Not Unusual for about the 20,000th time.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nit was in march 1965 that his first hit, it's not unusual.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

This one's goofier and tastier, and won't leave you needing a change of clothes.  It's the #TwizzlerChallenge. So what's this challenge all about?  Think of the spaghetti scene from \"Lady and the Tramp,\" except substitute a Twizzler for the noodle. Chomp and chomp and chomp until your lips meet in the middle, then smooch.  Simple enough. You're supposed to do a video, of course, and challenge others to do the same for a good cause. The ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on Comedy Central's \"Night of Too Many Stars,\" a fundraiser for autism programs. A tweet from sportscaster Fred Katz challenged the \"Today\" show's Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba, who plays  Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" to share a \"Lady and the Tramp\" licorice. It took off from there.  Next thing you knew, Geist was repeating the stunt with Meredith Vieira and the #TwizzlerChallenge was on. Geist and Vieira challenged Matt Lauer and Kathy Lee Gifford.  They were good sports about it, but you may want to close your eyes here.  This isn't for the faint of heart. The challenge is starting to invade social media.  Just search the hashtag #TwizzlerChallenge. It sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at Twizzlers.  Their candy is on the lips of America. And to their credit, a couple of Twizzlers executives took the challenge and donated $10,000. The money goes to New York Collaborates for Autism.  The group funds and creates schools, programs and services for people with autism nationwide. Since 2006, \"Night of Too Many Stars\" has raised over $22 million.  If this challenge is even half as successful as the Ice Bucket Challenge, that number will triple.

They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder. Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering. For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger. Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) slides home a late winner to give Swansea City a 1-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon . Gomis (centre) wheels away in celebration after netting his late goal while the Villa players look crestfallen .

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy. This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with \u00a328million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot. Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected to plant a firm shot past Brad Guzan. Sherwood, who saw his side lose to Stoke in injury time of his Villa debut, was in terse mood afterwards. Defeat hurts him deeply.

'There comes a time in a game when if you're looking like not winning it you make sure you don't lose it. We have to try and address that.' It was a close match. Swansea bossed the first half, Villa shaded the second. In the 57th minute Gabby Agbonlahor thought he had scored when Christian Benteke's header fell his way four yards out. But Neil Taylor blocked brilliantly. Scott Sinclair and Fabian Delph both sent good openings wide and Sinclair almost found an equaliser in added time when volleying inches over the bar. By now Benteke had gone off because of a niggling hip problem and Swansea could have extended their winning margin when Routledge ran free close to the end. But Guzan saved well. In the first half the American goalkeeper twice denied Gomis, who should have scored from Taylor's cross on six minutes. He also had a great chance 16 minutes from time after Monetro's ball but Clark diverted the shot away. Gomis was not to be denied, leaving Garry Monk delighted.

If you haven't seen it, you have likely heard selections from the film's interview with Mukesh Singh, who is on death row for the crime. \"A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy,\" he says. \"When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent.\" Certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as, \"In our culture, there is no place for a woman\" and that if a daughter or sister \"engaged in pre-marital activities ... I would put petrol on her and set her alight.\" Note: Those men are not rapist-murderers. They are their lawyers. Many (I'd like to think most) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny. But these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul. Let's be clear: Singh is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others, but still -- from a cultural script we all share. Yes, we all. Perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was, \"Violence against women is really bad...in India.\" And in many ways, of course, it is. Reports this weekend of a robbery at a Christian school in eastern India, in which, officials said, one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70-year-old nun, add to the narrative. But as unfathomable as this brutality is, we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of American violence-against-women exceptionalism, making others the bad guys while crowing about \"how far women have come\" in the United States. Or to say, \"Sure, we still have issues, but not like that.\" I know that temptation is there. Our global human rights organization, based in the U.S. and India, works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable. When I describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption: that we here in the U.S. are working solely to stop violence against women in India. Yet we do have issues in the U.S., issues \"like that.\" We have mass murderer Elliot Rodger, who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista California last year, wrote his own 137-page version of that same misogynist script. We know from \"The Hunting Ground,\" documentarian Kirby Dick's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women, and many men, have had violated their right to an education free from violence. We know that women are leaving the tech industry, Wall Street, and Internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence. We know that women (and people of all genders) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day. And what of the response? As Zak Cheney-Rice noted, discussing \"India's Daughter\" in Mic.com, \"from India to the U.S., citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims.\" A United Nations report released last week, marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women's rights conference in Beijing, confirms that (as The New York Times put it) \"violence against women -- including rape, murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor, at war and at peace.\" Everywhere. We can't relegate such violence to \"the other,\" to the \"not here, not us, not me.\" To do so is not only incorrect, it is damaging. Yes, we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world's citizens. Yes, violence against women varies in form and degree. But to imagine that violence against women happens only, or mostly, \"somewhere else,\" is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home. Concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves. Likewise, the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists, wherever they live, do not absolve us. We must all ask ourselves: To what degree do we repeat those scripts, or stay silent when we hear them from others? Our actions, and inactions, fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge. We cannot furrow our brows about India, or any of those \"others\" -- abusive men in fraternities, for example -- and be done. Indeed, \"India's Daughter\" premiered in the U.S. with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide. So let's bring about the day when the next buzzworthy documentary is about the women and men and allies of all genders who have stepped up, together, to say no more: not in my home, not in my school, not in my country, not anywhere.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe bbc four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena.

He twists in the air before landing on his back as another child, far right, watches on in horror . The Moscow Football Federation has branded the training drill incident 'outrageous' The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is deciding whether to bring charges for cruelty against Pavlov, but the coach claims his kick looked worse than it was. The Moscow Football Federation branded the incident 'outrageous'. 'I was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner,' claimed the coach, who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle. 'I started showing him - and just then the child jumped. So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air. 'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence. 'He fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt. The person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle.' Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children. While he did not apologise to the Eugene Efimov after the kick, he claims he has done so since.

Left, Valentin Pavlov, the coach who denies kicking\u00a0Eugene Efimov (right) with the intent of hurting him . She said: 'I was at the match and watching the game, and it was just part of the game.

The video however has underlined a tough attitude that many parents in Russia have to raising children, where violence from parents or teachers is still often regarded as acceptable as a way of making sure they grow up properly. Asked if he was angry at the kick, the boy told local TV: 'No. I am not mad at him, I fell down because I jumped, I didn't feel any pain, it just looked bad.'

'Recently we have focused on teaching him routines rather than new tricks and we reward him with positive reinforcement - praise, love, cuddles and of course treats and toys.

The MLS outfit have released a snippet of the music video for their track 'All The Way' which includes contributions by singer-songwriter Sarah Packiam, MC Sterlin and Villa. New York City ace Villa took to Twitter to provide his 6.96million followers with a chance of having a 'sneak peek' at his collaboration with the music duo. David Villa is all smiles as he provides backing vocals for New York City FC's new anthem . The 33-year-old stars in the music video along with Sarah Packiam and MC Sterlin . The full version of the song will be released on Wednesday ahead of New York City's opening game of the 2015 MLS campaign. Villa's first competitive match in America will see the former Barcelona ace go up against Kaka's Orlando City Soccer Club at the Citrus Bowl on Sunday. New York City fans will be hoping his highly-anticipated MLS debut is somewhat better than his laboured music video performance. Packiam and MC Sterlin take to the streets during the music video performance . Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday . Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d\u2019Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard \u2013 New York City FC .

The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. \"What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,\" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. \"I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,\" Richel said. \"I didn't hear him say anything,\" she said. \"Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today.\" She said the man came \"within inches\" of whacking her with the machete. \"This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,\" Richel said. \"And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible.\" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. \"Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" she said. \"I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him.\" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. \"What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,\" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. \"The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span ... of this event,\" Normand said. \"Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else.\" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said \"there is a mental illness component\" in their investigation of the suspect. \"No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,\" Normand said. \"And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior.\" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport. Contrary to earlier reports, Normand said Saturday, White was no longer a taxi driver. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport was with a machete and a car containing smoke bombs.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct.

One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised.

Truck: A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety . Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt.

Sales of rare U.S. coins reached a record of nearly $536 . million last year, and now collectors are turning to the D. Brent Pogue Collection, which could boost it higher. Gathered over more than 30 years by Texas property developer . A. Mack Pogue and his son, D. Brent, it is considered the most . valuable collection of federal American coins dating from the . 1790s to the late 1830s in private hands. Scroll down for video . Above, a rare 1822 Half Eagle five-dollar gold piece, one of only three known to exist. The rare five-dollar gold piece and a prized silver dollar each could fetch $10 million or more in upcoming auctions . An 1822 Half Eagle five-dollar gold piece, one of only three . known to exist, and an 1804 Silver Dollar dubbed the 'King of . American Coins' are expected to be among the top lots when the . collection is sold in a series of auctions in New York beginning . in May and continuing into 2017. 'These two coins in particular, we think, have a possibility . of being up around that $10 million mark,' Brian Kendrella, the . president of Stack's Bowers Galleries, told Reuters. The rare coin and currency auctioneer, which is handling the . sales with Sotheby's, believes the coins could shatter the $10 . million record set in 2013 for a 1794 Silver Dollar. Although jaw-dropping prices for contemporary art grabbed . headlines in 2014, rare coins also had a banner year and are . among the biggest collectibles behind art and antiques. A 200-year-old Silver Dollar dubbed the'\"King of American Coins,' is seen in an undated handout photo courtesy of PCGS . Coin sales are driven by the economy, but Kendrella said . investors and collectors are also lured by the rarity, . uniqueness, condition and historical links of coins. 'They are artifacts that speak to what was going on in the . United States at the time these coins were made,' he said. 'That's one of the main draws.' With a dozen coins selling for $1 million or more in 2014 . and the first gold coin struck for the United States fetching . $4.5 million, the nonprofit Professional Numismatists Guild . estimates the overall U.S. rare coin market to be worth about $5 . billion. Walter Husak, a retired aerospace entrepreneur based in . California, knows just how lucrative it can be. A collection of . 301 rare penny coins dating from 1793 to 1814 that he gathered . over more than 13 years sold in 2008 for $10.7 million, about . double what he invested in it. 'I never thought it would go up that much,' he said. 'There . are a lot of people getting involved in coins.' Barry Stuppler, secretary of the Professional Numismatists . Guild, has seen plenty of changes in his 52 years in the coin . business, with buyers increasing in recent years. 'It is a combination of the economy coming back,' he said of . the market, 'and the fact that interest rates are very low.' The Internet also has been 'a tremendous, tremendous source . of new buyers and sellers of coins that we didn't have 20 years . ago,' said Stuppler. Demand for rare, investment-quality coins, graded and . certified by the guild and the Florida-based Numismatic Guaranty . Corporation, is high and supply is low.

'This is my country': As many as a thousand people could be forced to move if the WA State Government plan goes ahead . In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations.\u00a0I SUPPORT YOU'. Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said. He told his father 'I think I'm going to live out here forever' but his father said he should finish college first and evaluate his options then. The X-Men star said he was inspired by the Indigenous people's sense of community and togetherness.

The double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to McLaren in the early years and then moving to Mercedes for the 2013 season, despite the aristocracy of British motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team. The importance of making the correct decision was reinforced on the podium after Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, when he saw Sebastian Vettel on the top step after the German\u2019s own successful move from Red Bull to Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton sits on the podium alongside Sebastian Vettel after he claimed his first victory for Ferrari . Hamilton, out of contract at the end of the season, says his new Mercedes deal will be completed this week . Hamilton, who finished second, also thought of Fernando Alonso, whose career management has been disastrous since he left Renault in 2005, the year he won the last of his two world titles. The Spaniard then walked out on McLaren when he could have won a third championship, went back to Renault as a stop-gap, joined Ferrari while it was moribund and returned to McLaren this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners Honda. Alonso managed less than half of Sunday\u2019s race before a cooling problem intervened. Vettel, in only his second race for Ferrari, won in the car Alonso had just vacated. \u2018It\u2019s nice to see Ferrari back up,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I sat next to Sebastian and thought to myself, \u201cWhat is Fernando thinking?\u201d I remember when I left McLaren and came here, we were better the next year. I had a good feeling then, but he\u2019s almost done the opposite of what I did. It could have been him today. It\u2019s just strange how things turn out. Hamilton finished behind race-winner Vettel in Sepang but still remains in the lead of the world championship . Hamilton led Vettel off the start-line at the Malaysian Grand Prix but eventually lost out to the German . \u2018McLaren are a fantastic team. It looks bad now but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get it together. Before you know it, it will be the three of us fighting, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u2019 Alonso\u2019s predicament is a terrible shame because he was the heir who supplanted Michael Schumacher as the German approached his first retirement in 2009. Hamilton, 30, does not want to fall into the same trap, and says he is ready to sign a new contract with Mercedes for three more years beyond this season. The tantalising prospect of his joining Ferrari, where he is hugely admired by president Sergio Marchionne, seems remote. They have Vettel and Hamilton is already part of a top team. No matter Sunday\u2019s result \u2014 Hamilton beaten on pure pace by Vettel\u2019s Ferrari \u2014 Mercedes are the team of the moment. Asked about signing for Ferrari, Hamilton said: \u2018No, don\u2019t be silly. My contract at Mercedes should be done this week. There\u2019s no reason why not. Honestly, it\u2019s 99.6 per cent done.\u2019 Hamilton is expected to earn more than his current annual \u00a320million salary when he pens his new deal . The exact terms of drivers\u2019 contracts are kept secret, but it is thought that Hamilton will get more than his current annual \u00a320million salary, though probably not match Vettel\u2019s deal at Ferrari, which could be worth up to \u00a335m if he collects all his bonuses and extras. The Mercedes board want their team to be cost-efficient and will not pay the Earth even for a driver of Hamilton\u2019s talent. As well as tying up the contract, Mercedes will spend the fortnight before the next race in China responding to the Ferrari challenge. It is believed that the cooler temperatures expected in Shanghai will favour Mercedes, but at least their defeat after eight successive wins relieved the monotony. \u2018I don\u2019t think Ferrari\u2019s win is a one-off,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I don\u2019t think they were lucky or it was a fluke. There\u2019s always talk that they are easier on their tyres. \u2018I think we\u2019ll manage. We\u2019ve got a great group of people, a great approach, and from this we\u2019ll take a step back. \u2018Second for me and third for Nico (Rosberg) is still good but they\u2019re too close to us in the championship, so we\u2019ll work very hard to analyse. It was not a kick; it was a pinch. We have now got a race on our hands.\u2019 That is good news for the sport and hope for all the teams.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nlewis hamilton claimed his first victory for ferrari.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Last year, Shake It Off went to No.1 on the iTunes chart in 64 different countries and in January, she sold the four millionth copy of 1989 in the US alone. The new success had coincided with a new Taylor - one who had cut off her long blonde hair into a sophisticated bob, moved to New York and developed a close-knit group of female friends who she frequently hosts dinner parties for at her Tribeca apartment. Perhaps most crucially though, 2014 also marked the year that Taylor Swift was a singleton. Taylor with with the supermodel Cara Delevingne . Taylor with the singer Lorde (left) and Ellie Goulding (right) Since she was 16, Taylor has had a slew of celebrity boyfriends that have all ended in heartbreak. It would be hard not to be aware of her failed romances, given the coverage they have received both in her music and in the news. In her teens, she dated heartthrobs Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas, before moving on to the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer. There was a brief romance with Conor Kennedy before what has now become her most famous relationship - Harry Styles. Taylor Swift with ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas, who she dated in 2008 . Taylor Swift with Taylor Lautner, who she dated in 2009 . But her dalliance with the One Direction star was enough to put Taylor off men and since her break-up with the singer in January 2013, she has focused on living a single life. She told The Telegraph on Saturday: 'The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship - I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are.' 'I used to think it was important to find a boyfriend, but I don't feel that it is now.' In doing this, the tide has turned for Taylor in terms of public opinion - up until last year, many derided the star for being boy crazy and acting like a crazed bunny boiler. The reputation for being a man hunter also unfairly affected people's opinions about her professional success, which has been almost unprecedented for a singer/songwriter of her age. Taylor with Jake Gyllenhaal (left), who she dated in 2010 and Conor Kennedy, who she dated in 2012 . Taylor with Harry Styles in December 2012 in New York . But with 1989, a new Taylor emerged - the songs were no longer about men and more about her relationships with her peers and the public. Shake It Off was a brilliant two fingers up to the 'haters' who had been criticising her for so long simply for having boyfriends. Taylor's move to New York from Nashville also coincided with a chic new style. For the last 12 months, the star has consistently been photographed on the world's best dressed lists and she even holds her own when out partying with her gaggle of supermodel friends like Karlie Kloss.

But from a very young age, the youngster from Los Angeles knew it simply wasn't the case. The transgender 15-year-old knew he was a boy from the age of two, setting his physical 'parts' aside. Writing for CNN, he has described how he knew he was male long before he discovered the terms 'gay' and 'sexuality', and the difficulty he encountered with other people's perceptions growing up. He also urges parents to let children set out their path - no matter their gender. Avery Wallace (right) poses for a picture with his sister Riley in 2002 at the age of three. He claims he knew he was a boy when he was two . His parents let him cut his hair short for his preschool graduation, even though he was wearing a dress . Describing life as a toddler, he said: 'I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind - not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. 'No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part.' He said he first heard the term 'gay' in second grade, even after he had his first 'girlfriend', and remembered how one year 'a penis' was at the top of his Christmas list. However he feared people may perceive him as 'different' when he learned homosexuality was considered by some to be abnormal. 'I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay - but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over.' At the age of seven he started to prefer wearing boys clothes and by eight, he was playing baseball . Avery was elected class president in the fifth grade by his peers. He strongly stated that he was a boy\u00a0and the 'people that mattered knew it too, for the most part' He is pictured at age 10 with short, curly hair. By now he was living the life of a boy, but the word transgender hadn't formed part of his vocabulary . Avery described how he was able to become the boy he wanted, because he grew up in a house that taught him to 'love anyone I wanted to.' 'That said,' he added. 'I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either.' When he entered middle school, he grew out his hair and started to wear dresses as to avoid the 'emotional torture'. But in 2012, when he was 12, he told his parents he was transgender. He is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment after attending a number of group sessions, and has urged people to consider categorizing people into boys and girls more carefully. 'I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight,' Avery said. He added: 'Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was.' Avery wore a suit and lavender waistcoat for his fifth grade graduation, but from then on he grew out his hair and some times wore a dress to avoid the 'emotional torture' of middle school .

Tammy Barnett from Richfield, Utah, was killed when an SUV overturned near the city of Hamilton, in New Zealand, during a 'trip of a lifetime'. Her husband Richard (pictured) was injured in the crash and was in a stable condition in hospital on Thursday . Tragic: 'Devoted' parents Mitchell and Ruth Peterson, who had five children together, were also killed . They were travelling in a convoy with other tourists who witnessed the crash, and local police are now investigating. Their wrecked vehicle was discovered by an off-duty police officer who was on his way home. On Monday, when they touched down following a flight from Los Angeles, he wrote on Facebook: 'We made it to New Zealand. Wish I could say the same for our luggage. Or at least tammys.' Mr Barnett, who is an orthodontist in the town, and his late wife, have four children and four grandchildren together. Mr Peterson was a LDS in his ward and ran a visitor center. Richfield Mayor David Ogden told the\u00a0Desert News: 'The whole valley has been affected by this. We all know them. They are so important in our lives, and so we are going to rally around the families.' A GoFundMe page set up in a bid to cover Mr Barnett's medical and Mrs Barnett's funeral costs read: Our dearest wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, grandmother and friend Tammy tragically left us while on the trip of a lifetime to New Zealand with her beloved husband Richard. 'Tammy had an incredible energy about her and will be sorely missed. We have the unique opportunity to make this time a little easier to bear. Family: Mr Barnett (left) is an orthodontist in the Utah town. The pair (pictured with their son Topher) were said to be well-known and respected within the community and were members of the Mormon church . Mr Barnett updated his Facebook status when they landed in New Zealand following a flight from Los Angeles. He is expected to be released from hospital this week . Couple: Mrs Barnett, pictured with her 'beloved' husband in 1980 was described as a woman who had an 'incredible energy' and will be sorely missed . 'Let's band together as family and friends to show our love and support for Tammy and Richard. Please, if you are able, we would love your assistance to help cover the funeral and associated expenses. 'Thank you for your support during this difficult time.' The page has already raised $4,655. A separate page to cover Mr and Mrs Peterson's funeral costs read: 'Mitchell and Ruth died in a tragic car accident in New Zealand. They were on a trip of a life time. Mitch and Ruth leave five beautiful children to take on the responsibility of funeral costs. 'Please help this sweet family through a very tragic time with the funeral costs of their mother and father. 'Mitch and Ruth are the type of people you are drawn to. They would do anything for anyone and they had a contagious energy. Scene: Their wrecked vehicle was discovered by an off-duty police officer who was on his way home . 'They were devoted parents who would sacrifice everything for their children. As they talked about their children you could see their absolute love and devotion to them. Their children were the center of their universe. 'Mitch and Ruth cared deeply about the people in their little community. If you knew them you couldn't help but love them. They called so many of us friends. 'Mitch was a great Dr who cared for all of his patients and they all could feel that love and compassion. 'Mitch and Ruth belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Mitch is the Bishop of his ward and cared so deeply for the people whom he served. 'Mitch and Ruth are amazing parents, grandparents, children, aunt and uncle, cousins and friends. They will be deeply missed by so many!'

Friends Gayle Smart (pictured left) and Joanne Baker (right) were both left with horrific injuries and deep scars above their eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub . But police say they are satisfied no crime has been committed. The women had gone out for drinks in the city centre on Friday night with Ms Baker's boyfriend John Burton, 26, when they ended up at the Rose and Crown. 'We had been in the pub then we went outside then the next thing I remember\u00a0is our heads were banged together,' said Ms Baker. Ms Smart, a waitress, added: 'As far as I can remember I was just\u00a0outside having a cigarette and our heads were just smashed together.' Gayle Smart (left) and Joanne Baker (right) believe someone smashed their heads together outside the pub . The incident took place outside the Rose and Crown pub in Newcastle (pictured) Neither realised how seriously injured they were until\u00a0they looked at one another's faces. Ms Baker said: 'I just saw Gayle's face and I was more\u00a0concerned about her. But she was looking at me and asking me\u00a0if I was OK.' Mr Burton ran to a nearby Greggs shop to get tissues to stem\u00a0the women's bleeding and police and paramedics arrived at the scene. Ms Smart,\u00a0who lives in Bensham, Gateshead, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary\u00a0by ambulance, while Ms Baker got a taxi back to her home in North Shields. Mother-of-two Ms Baker (pictured) said she had to tell her daughter her injury was fancy dress because the little girl was so shocked at her appearance . When she arrived home she discovered the true extent of her injuries and went to North\u00a0Tyneside General Hospital. 'When I got home I was really shocked,' Ms Baker said. 'The cut was so deep I\u00a0had to have internal stitches and eight external stitches.' The mother-of-two said: 'When my kids saw it they nearly passed out. I had to tell my daughter it was fancy dress because she was so shocked.' Mother-of-two Ms Smart said she now has to put up with awkward questions and curious\u00a0looks from customers at the pub where she works. The pair say they believe\u00a0someone deliberately banged their heads together but police say they can\u00a0find no evidence of a crime being committed. Ms Baker said: 'I'm going to be scarred for life. I just can't believe\u00a0all this has happened just from going to a bar. It just doesn't make sense. Ms Smart added: 'There was blood smeared across my forehead. When I\u00a0saw it I was in shock. And now it's going to scar.' A Northumbria Police spokeswoman said: 'Police were informed of a\u00a0disturbance in Newcastle city centre at around 8.35pm on Friday. 'Two women\u00a0suffered facial injuries. Officers attended and inquiries were carried out\u00a0and it was established no offences were committed. Suitable advice was\u00a0given to both parties.'

Thanks to the European Space Agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft. The amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans, and others that are simply as they originally sounded. The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip. It took off from French Guiana at 9.46pm GMT on Friday 27 March (pictured), carrying two satellites that will expand Europe\u2019s Galileo system . The various noises from space are shared on Esa's\u00a0esaops Soundcloud page. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended. According to Esa they \u2018give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board Huygens would have heard during one minute of the descent through Titan's atmosphere.\u2019 With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn\u2019t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's \u2018water\u2019 is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe (illustrated) as it descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended . Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz. The \u2018music\u2019 was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible. Elsewhere, the famous sounds of comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko (pictured), as heard by the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae probe, are also replayed. Rosetta\u2019s Plasma Consortium (RPC) recorded oscillations in the comet\u2019s magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz . The landing of Philae on the surface of 67P on 12 November 2014 is also heard in a brief clip, which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown. Philae subsequently bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest in an unknown location, wedged under a cliff somewhere in partial darkness. Scientists at Esa are hoping that the probe will wake up in the coming weeks as sunlight recharges its batteries, letting them perform more key science on the surface. Philae's first landing on the surface, seen here as pictured from the Rosetta spacecraft, can be heard in a short clip. The probe then bounced twice before coming to rest in an unknown location . The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip.

The search for Noah Thomas, from Dublin, has widened since he was first went missing when his mother decided to get another hour of sleep on Sunday morning. The four-foot, 60lb redheaded child's mother saw the boy at 9am but went back to bed and couldn't find him and saw that the living room door was open when she woke back up around 10am or 10.30am. Noah Thomas, 5, has been missing for two days after last being seen watching cartoons Sunday morning in Dublin, Virginia . Search crews have looked around the boy's house, where his mother saw him at 9am but could not find him after she woke up at 10 . A ground search continued overnight on Sunday and expanded to include more than 100 members of Virginia law enforcement near the boy's home in Pulaski County, according to\u00a0WDBJ. The FBI and Virginia State Police have become involved in the search. Police and more than 100 volunteers who signed up to look for Noah in the small town have covered about 3.3 square miles. Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said that authorities have no evidence of foul play in his disappearance. Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical'. No suspicious vehicles were seen in the area. The boy, who helped drop his mother and infant sibling drop his father off at work at 7am, is believed to be wearing a camouflage jacket, black and yellow paints and Spider-Man boots. He may also be wearing a San Diego Chargers jersey with the number 21 on it. Crews have used helicopters in the search in the area, which is mostly residential with farmland and a woods by the boy's house.

Billy Chrimes, deputy search and rescue coordinator with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, said that the best opportunity to find a missing child is often at night when they stop moving. Lack of food and water and potential problems with wildlife are also concerns, he told the Roanoke Times. Temperatures on Monday night were in the mid-40s.

Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup. They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them. England coach Peter Moores talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time . Moores finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level . But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job. 'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better. 'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment \u2013 to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament. 'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old b\u00eate noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nancelotti's ancelotti says he was concerned by the way his players relaxed.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\n(CNN)\"India's Daughter,\" the BBC Four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in Delhi, premiered in the U.S. last week. If you haven't seen it, you have likely heard selections from the film's interview with Mukesh Singh, who is on death row for the crime. \"A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy,\" he says. \"When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent.\" Certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as, \"In our culture, there is no place for a woman\" and that if a daughter or sister \"engaged in pre-marital activities ... I would put petrol on her and set her alight.\" Note: Those men are not rapist-murderers. They are their lawyers. Many (I'd like to think most) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny. But these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul. Let's be clear: Singh is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others, but still -- from a cultural script we all share. Yes, we all. Perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was, \"Violence against women is really bad...in India.\" And in many ways, of course, it is. Reports this weekend of a robbery at a Christian school in eastern India, in which, officials said, one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70-year-old nun, add to the narrative. But as unfathomable as this brutality is, we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of American violence-against-women exceptionalism, making others the bad guys while crowing about \"how far women have come\" in the United States. Or to say, \"Sure, we still have issues, but not like that.\" I know that temptation is there. Our global human rights organization, based in the U.S. and India, works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable. When I describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption: that we here in the U.S. are working solely to stop violence against women in India. Yet we do have issues in the U.S., issues \"like that.\" We have mass murderer Elliot Rodger, who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista California last year, wrote his own 137-page version of that same misogynist script. We know from \"The Hunting Ground,\" documentarian Kirby Dick's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women, and many men, have had violated their right to an education free from violence. We know that women are leaving the tech industry, Wall Street, and Internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence. We know that women (and people of all genders) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day. And what of the response? As Zak Cheney-Rice noted, discussing \"India's Daughter\" in Mic.com, \"from India to the U.S., citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims.\" A United Nations report released last week, marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women's rights conference in Beijing, confirms that (as The New York Times put it) \"violence against women -- including rape, murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor, at war and at peace.\" Everywhere. We can't relegate such violence to \"the other,\" to the \"not here, not us, not me.\" To do so is not only incorrect, it is damaging. Yes, we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world's citizens. Yes, violence against women varies in form and degree. But to imagine that violence against women happens only, or mostly, \"somewhere else,\" is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home. Concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves. Likewise, the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists, wherever they live, do not absolve us. We must all ask ourselves: To what degree do we repeat those scripts, or stay silent when we hear them from others? Our actions, and inactions, fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge. We cannot furrow our brows about India, or any of those \"others\" -- abusive men in fraternities, for example -- and be done. Indeed, \"India's Daughter\" premiered in the U.S. with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide. So let's bring about the day when the next buzzworthy documentary is about the women and men and allies of all genders who have stepped up, together, to say no more: not in my home, not in my school, not in my country, not anywhere.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe bbc four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in delhi premiered.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Hush, hush, whisper, whisper. \"They called it the 'C' word, and it didn't get talked about in doctor's offices,\" said Beth Kallmyer of the Alzheimer's Association. \"It certainly wasn't talked about in the general public, it was whispered.\" Today it's Alzheimer's, and 55% of patients and their caregivers say their doctors never told them they have the devastating disease, according to a special report of the Alzheimer's Association released this week. Compare that to one of the big four cancers -- breast, colorectal, lung and prostate -- more than 90% said their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis. \"Alzheimer's not being talked about, many doctors are not giving the diagnosis,\" added Kallmyer in a webcast. \"We need to change that. It's a disease, it's nothing to be ashamed about.\" \"This is very current, very well done, and pretty dramatic findings, let's be honest,\" said Dr. Pierre Tariot, director of Banner's Alzheimer's Institute. \"I am reminded of the rather sobering fact that as many as 60% of people who have a dementia die without the dementia having been diagnosed by their doctor.\" Why the silence? This is not the first report to show doctors are sidestepping this tough conversation. But why? That's been studied too, and the reasons doctors give range from diagnostic uncertainty and fear of causing emotional distress to time constraints, lack of support, and stigma. \"There is an element of stigma here towards brain and mental health problems in general,\" said Tariot. \"I would call it professional awkwardness. I can't really help this condition, why invest time and energy talking about it, it makes me squirm.\" \"I think the comparison of Alzheimer's to cancer is appropriate,\" said Dr. Tom Price, Medical Director for Emory University's Geriatric Clinic. \"I give patients a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease many times a week, and every time it is uncomfortable, and I've been doing it for over 10 years. It is easier to talk about cancer now that there are so many new and effective treatment strategies, and cause of optimism with survival from cancer at an all-time high.\" What's at stake . Alzheimer's advocates stress the importance of giving a patient all the facts, as early as possible, so they can work with their family to organize legal and health directives and have time to fulfill life-long desires. It's just as important for the caregiver. \"Imagine it's your spouse,\" said Tariot. \"Personality changes, memory is different, language and communication is different, you don't know what is going on. Then you start getting answers, and you get a sense of how to play to his strengths and minimize his weaknesses. Here are travel tips, communication tips, and safety issues; here are ways to stay happy and joyful, even though this is a new chronic illness.\" There's another critical factor as well: access to clinical trials that might help slow the illness. \"Right now, the big studies that are underway in prevention are really looking at people in the early stages of Alzheimer's,\" said Kallmyer. \"So by waiting, they can lose out on clinical trials as well.\" Addressing the 'gap' \"We want to be clear that we believe physicians are well meaning, but there's a gap there somewhere,\" said Keith Fargo, Director of Scientific Programs for the Alzheimer's Association. \"We saw doctors say lack of time, lack of resources, so we think the answer to this mostly has to do with education and providing more resources.\" Experts CNN spoke to agreed. \"As a field, we have failed,\" Tariot told CNN. \"It isn't just the doctors in the trenches. Medical schools, professional organizations and health care systems have not recognized the importance of identification and management of people with dementia.\" \"I think that medical school curriculum does need to update to include neurodegenerative diseases in their 'giving bad news' training -- Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example,\" said Price. \"We do need to educate all providers to be aware that hesitance to give the diagnosis reduces the ability of the patient and family to make some choices and planning that is essential for emotional and financial well-being.\"\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthis is not the first report to show doctors are sidestepping this.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Ander Herrera, one of Manchester United's star players on Sunday, tackles Liverpool's Adam Lallana . Herrera says watching Lionel Messi against Manchester City almost made him cry with joy . The Manchester United midfielder says he needed time to adapt to life at United, because he is 'earthly' 'The last time I cried?' he said, when asked in an interview with Spanish paper El Pais. 'I almost cried watching Messi against Man City. He's so good! But anyway, I get emotional very easily. But hey, I get excited easily and not only with the major teams.

Herrera was asked about the sense of humour in the dressing room, and said it is better with Spanish players . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney insults the Spaniards in their own language, according to Herrera . 'The jokes here are different,' said Herrera. 'Rooney is outgoing and insults us in Spanish. I'd rather talk to him about football because he likes boxing and could try it with me.' However, he was also clear that respect for Rooney is high, insisting that 'I just listen to Rooney and Carrick before games'. 'There is a lot of respect for Rooney and Carrick,who spent many years here, because you see that it is very difficult to do. 'But David De Gea says the dressing room used to be more hierarchic with Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs.' Herrera says Michael Carrick is one of the main leaders in the Manchester United dressing room . The Manchester United star, who played a beautiful pass to Juan Mata for his side's first goal on Sunday at Anfield, also praised English football for the patience of its fans, and the high standard of refereeing. 'The Premier League is the best place to succeed because people are patient. In Spain there's more stir around you from press or fans. 'There's a lot of respect for referees in England.

The dispute between the party\u2019s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co\u2019 at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics \u2013 as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party\u2019s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nYears ago, when our house was always full of small children, I staggered downstairs with a couple of fellow mothers after a chaotic communal bath-time and found the visiting Dads pouring well-earned drinks. We reported that, just before we battened down the hatches, all the three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic and comparing the size of their willies. The mothers all laughed. So did the fathers, for a brief moment, but then, in chorus, they ask\u2122ed: \u2018Um . . . and whose was the . . .?\u2019 Civilized, cultured, happily married men, not a porn-hound or a libertine among them, but they couldn\u2019t help it. Willy-worship, willy-pride, is hard-wired deep in the male brain. However much they deny it, men do seem to care. Actors Jonny Lee Miller (left) and\u00a0Benedict Cumberbatch (right) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark-naked performances as Frankenstein a few years ago . Why else would King\u2019s College London have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure (one hopes not the hard, cold, sharp steel sort) and proudly report that the average length, unstimulated, is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect. I do admire the chaps\u2019 willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler. Brrr. But the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends. And that they all secretly, privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average. The academics explain that it\u2019s all about \u2018using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position\u2019, and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder, and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online. So, don\u2019t tell me men don\u2019t care. Further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing Frankenstein play at the National Theatre a few years ago, in which on alternate nights the role of the Creature, stark-naked during a long opening scene, was taken by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. Conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable, centring on who won that particular contest, and including the immortal line in a theatre-bar argument. \u2018Ah yes, I see what you mean, but is it a show-er or a grower?\u2019 We women edged away, to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being Dr Frankenstein. Libby says she blames author, Jilly Cooper (pictured), for giving men the impression that women are worried about size . Though to be fair, some of the girls were admiring the surrounding abs, pecs, and glutes. We do like a man who looks healthy. It\u2019s a primitive need in the female to bond with a man who is going to be able to take the bins out unaided. But honestly, hand on heart, I suspect that very few of us during early courtship \u2014 or afterwards, or even after the golden wedding \u2014 are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6in average. The idea that we are waiting with a ruler and a scornful frown for the kecks to come off is miles from reality. I blame author Jilly Cooper for giving men that impression, with all her crazed descriptions of things rearing up like the Tower of Pisa, or space shuttles, or \u2014 my least favourite \u2014 a \u2018joyous otter\u2019. I suppose the trouble is that writing sex scenes you have few choices. You can resort to heavy innuendo, or do some Barbara Cartland stuff about being carried away to heaven on wings of bliss. Or you can throw in the towel and pretend the female eye will only be delighted by the spectacle of something that would fit neatly into the London or Manhattan skyline, somewhere between Centrepoint and the Gherkin. Though ideally, of course, not the Shard. The porn industry is obsessed with size, but anyone with half a brain and heart knows porn has little to do with the reality of lovemaking. Most of us have never cared about size. We don\u2019t carry on like the fearsome coven on TV\u2019s Sex And The City, shriekingly comparing notes in the back of taxis or skinny-muffin cafes. It is worth noting, without comment, that much of the genius behind those series and films came from \u2014 ahem \u2014 men. Gay men, in many cases. Out here in the real world, that is not the way women carry on. The only ones I\u2019ve ever known talk about male size were sad, angry girls, unhappy in themselves about their failure to bond happily with any of the possessors of the said tackle. Libby is keen to point out that most women don't carry on like the women in Sex And The City (pictured), comparing detailed notes on the men they know . What we like is much harder to measure. I know a lot of women, and have been one for ages, and it\u2019s simpler than you think. We like hugs, we like tenderness, we like men who seem (often bafflingly) to be delighted and aroused by the very sight of us, even without make-up and a heavy cold. We really like to be laughed into bed and treated with affectionate consideration once we\u2019re there.

The 45-year-old replaced Alex McLeish at the helm of the Premier League club in June 2012 but following a poor run of results, which left Villa in the bottom three, the club parted company with the Scot and later appointed Tim Sherwood as his successor. He told BBC's Football Focus: 'I don't have any bad things about Aston Villa. It's a brilliant football club as everybody knows. Paul Lambert says he only has 'good things' to say about Aston Villa despite his sacking in Feburary . Lambert believes Villa are in a healthier position than when he arrived, particularly in terms of their finances . 'I came in at really, probably a tough time and obviously when the financial reports came out, their losses are way down now so from that point of view the club is in probably a lot healthier position than when I went there. 'It's a great club with great people at it, and great people left behind. 'There's things when you look back and think \"maybe I should have done that better or different\" but I've got nothing but good things (to say) about the club.' Since leaving Villa, Lambert has spent time in Germany with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund working towards his UEFA Pro Licence. Lambert has spent time with Borussia Dortmund and Jurgen Klopp working towards his UEFA Pro Licence . Pep Guardiola is another manager in Germany that Lambert has been able to observe at close quarters of late . Although he enjoyed his time overseas and said his time spent there 'was a great experience', Lambert admitted he had no real plans to take up a managerial role abroad at this moment in time and follow the likes of former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes, who is head coach at Real Sociedad. When asked if he fancied managing overseas right now, the former Dortmund midfielder replied: 'Not really, I went over there - I've been back in the country for over a week or so now. 'The two clubs (Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich) there I know very well. Germany's been a big part of my life there but spending that time at Dortmund was a great experience and you learn so much, even though you're only there for that week or so to watch them....it was a great, great experience.' Lambert said he had no desire to follow\u00a0Real Sociedad head coach David Moyes in managing abroad . Lambert praised the work of Klopp and said that working with his Borussia Dortmund side was eye-opening . Sitting and talking with Guardiola was said to be a great experience for the former Aston Villa manager . Lambert praised the work Jurgen Klopp has done at the German club and admitted working and talking with the Dortmund coach and Bayern's Pep Guardiola was eye-opening. He added: '(Guardiola) and Jurgen Klopp are probably the best I've seen working. Just the way they can get the best out of people. 'I think meeting with him (Klopp) and Pep Guardiola was a great experience, to sit with them and talk to them. Defeat by Hull saw Lambert's Villa move into the relegation zone and he was subsequently sacked . Villa have improved under new manager Tim Sherwood but are still not too far off the Premier League drop . 'With Jurgen, I knew Jurgen from the Pro Licence, but to spend nine days with him was excellent. What you see on TV is what he's like as a guy....eccentric probably. He's a top, top guy and they way you see Borussia Dortmund now is probably due to him.' Lambert, who made 44 appearances playing for Dormund from 1996-1997 and helped them win the Champions League, said: 'Even though I'd played there - that was a massive football club - when I went back and watched them it's exploded really, really quickly and Jurgen has been a catalyst of what's happened.'

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\n(CNN)As the world awaits a possible nuclear agreement between the United States and Iran, let us not forget: This is the second time in two years that President Barack Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East. In doing so, he has ignored the regimes' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and U.S. national security. This month brought familiar news: more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator Bashar al-Assad against his fellow Syrians. Just in June, the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-Assad's chemical weapons, which had been prompted by his August 2013 sarin attacks on Syrian civilians and the threat of U.S. airstrikes in response. The deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-Assad's chemical weapons arsenal, which he can no longer use to threaten Syrians and Israel or fall into terrorist hands. However, with his actions as evidence, it was a deal that al-Assad likely knew he could manipulate. Even while the deal was underway, al-Assad continued to attack Syrian civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. The deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-Assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. Just weeks after claiming success, the administration quietly acknowledged that al-Assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons. Al-Assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities, as the agreement required. The deal made al-Assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly, mass atrocities he continued to commit. During implementation, the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition. About 50,000 more Syrians were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of Syrians throughout the region continued. Meanwhile, ISIS further exploited the civil war, expanding into security voids. There are several troubling parallels between the administration's deal with al-Assad and the one it is now pursuing with Tehran. Both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally na\u00efve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating. In both cases, the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and al Qaeda -- which these regimes have funded, trained or sheltered. All of this was true before the administration started these negotiations, and it remains true today. Neither Tehran nor al-Assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community. To the contrary, external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-Assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and Tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions. Both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay, obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements. As continues to be the case with al-Assad, Tehran has been emboldened by the administration's approach. It has increased lethal support to al-Assad in Syria, deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in Iraq, and ramped up aid to other militant groups, including the insurgent Houthis in Yemen. These activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that Iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in Iraq and Syria. As was the case with al-Assad, a deal will effectively make Tehran a partner to the administration in which the White House accepts the Iranian regime's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement. And there will still be little confidence that Tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts. Even while negotiations have been underway, Iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology. The regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency's access to others, including its infamous Parchin base. As IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano confirmed again this week, Tehran has still only partially answered one of the IAEA's long-standing, 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities. Amid his continued calls for \"death to America,\" Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal, not as a result of verified observance of a deal. Tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief. Without a complete understanding of Iran's program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a na\u00efve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life. We are seeing it once again in response to the administration's efforts with Iran. As we learned with Syria's al-Assad, making a deal with a terrorist-supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road.

The man, named only as Saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives. Jihadi John, who was recently unmasked as 26-year-old Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was last seen in a video posted online which appeared to show Japanese hostage Kenji Goto lying dead. Saleh, who worked as a translator, also revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die. ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi who is known as Jihadi John (seen, left, with Japanese hostage Kenji Goto) was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives, claims a defector known as Saleh (right) Face of a killer:\u00a0Saleh, who worked as a translator, revealed that Emwazi (above) routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die . Speaking to told Sky News in broken English from Turkey after fleeing ISIS, Saleh said: 'When he killed Kenji Goto, I live showed this (saw this) but not near, from a little (distance). 'The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say \"put this camera there, change place there\" but John (was) the big boss. 'All time, all time say to all \"fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish\". So respect him. Only he talks orders - others do.' Saleh said the prisoners would be given Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured that they would not be killed. He said: 'He would say to me \"say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. \"We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors\".' Saleh said he explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed. His comments explain why so many of the prisoners appear so calm in the executions videos right up to the point where the knife is placed against their throat. A still photo of  Kenji Goto holding a picture of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh. ISIS defector Saleh revealed how hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends . After Mr Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. Appearing with his face covered, the man added Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. He said: 'Maybe because he use the knife. I cannot understand why he is so strong. 'One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in ISIS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John.' And hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, with their captors telling them they would not be killed as it was a show for the camera, according to Saleh. Murderer: Jihadi John seen (in black mask) leading the execution of a dozen prisoners. Emwazi was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to defector Saleh . Kuwait-born Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities, but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. In e-mail exchanges with a journalist, the University of Westminster computer programming graduate said he considered suicide after coming face to face with what he suspected to be a British spy as he attempted to sell a laptop computer in 2010. Jihadi John rose to notoriety after he first appeared in a video posted online last August, in which he appeared to kill American journalist James Foley. Dressed in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose, and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

In a statement released on Monday, the league announced that the Falcons have been fined $350,000 (\u00a3237,000)\u00a0and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft. If the Falcons have multiple picks in that round, the highest selection will be forfeited. Team president Rich McKay has also been suspended from the league's Competition Committee beginning April 1. Atlanta Falcons have been fined \u00a3237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome . Owner Arthur Blank acknowledged the team's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . The NFL noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the Falcons violated league rules that state 'at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.' The league also said Roddy White, the team's former director of event marketing, was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club. The Falcons fired him. The league determined that Falcons ownership and senior executives, including McKay, were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise. But as the senior club executive overseeing game operations, McKay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules. McKay can petition Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than June 30. The Falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Falcons president Rick McKay has been suspended from his position on NFL Competition Committee . Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in early February that he had seen enough of the NFL's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club. 'It's not really a fine line,' Blank said. 'I think what we've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong. Anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field, we're opposed to, as a league, as a club and as an owner. It's obviously embarrassing but beyond embarrassing it doesn't represent our culture and what we're about.' The Falcons say 101 of 103 games have been sellouts since Blank bought the team in 2002. Actual turnouts declined during losing seasons the last two years. Atlanta ranked 10th among the 32 NFL teams with its average home attendance of 72,130 in 2014.

Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Valentin Pavlov claimed he was teaching Eugene Efimov how to kick the ball properly after the lad failed to show enough commitment in a tackle. He then ordered the frightened child to get back into the game. In the video, Valentin Pavol can be seen calling the seven-year-old player over to the sideline during training .

He twists in the air before landing on his back as another child, far right, watches on in horror . The Moscow Football Federation has branded the training drill incident 'outrageous' The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is deciding whether to bring charges for cruelty against Pavlov, but the coach claims his kick looked worse than it was. The Moscow Football Federation branded the incident 'outrageous'. 'I was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner,' claimed the coach, who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle. 'I started showing him - and just then the child jumped. So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air. 'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence. 'He fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt. The person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle.' Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children. While he did not apologise to the Eugene Efimov after the kick, he claims he has done so since.

The video however has underlined a tough attitude that many parents in Russia have to raising children, where violence from parents or teachers is still often regarded as acceptable as a way of making sure they grow up properly. Asked if he was angry at the kick, the boy told local TV: 'No. I am not mad at him, I fell down because I jumped, I didn't feel any pain, it just looked bad.'

Wardens at Windsor Castle claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money. Union officials say guides are paid terribly and have suffered years of \u2018wage restraint\u2019 despite working for the \u2018country\u2019s richest family\u2019. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money . Wardens\u2019 main duties are to meet and greet visitors, tell them about the history of the Castle, and hand out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said many are asked to go above and beyond this for no extra pay, including leading paid-for guided tours at the Castle. Other workers administer first aid or speak to tourists in a foreign language without being paid extra, they said. Now, the PCS says workers could adopt \u2018work to rule\u2019 \u2013 industrial action where workers do no more than the minimum required by their contract \u2013 unless they receive a pay hike. They said wardens were on as little as \u00a37.70 an hour, or \u00a314,400 a year for a 36-hour week. This is below the Living Wage, a voluntary threshold for employers which rose to \u00a37.85 in November, but significantly above the minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour. Windsor Castle said wages will rise to the new Living Wage in April, but the PCS argue this should have happened last November. A spokesman for PCS said: \u2018Workers are being paid really poor wages despite working for the country\u2019s richest family. Windsor Castle (pictured) said wages will rise to the new Living Wage in April, but the PCS argue this should have happened last November . \u2018A large proportion of staff have chosen to work at the Castle because they feel they are working the Queen and for the Royal Family. \u2018Their employers should not take advantage of that and abuse their goodwill by not properly rewarding them.\u2019 The wardens work for the Royal Collection Trust, a charity which presides over one of the world\u2019s largest and most important works of art, jewels and artefacts. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' It is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation, and workers for the Collection are therefore employees of the Royal Household. Forty wardens out of 200 workers at Windsor Castle have been balloted on whether they want to take industrial action. While the union has ruled out a strike, staff may refuse to work overtime and conduct guided tours and insist on taking their full lunch breaks. If wardens vote for this, it would be the first time staff have ever done so over working conditions specific to a Royal Household, the PCS said. A spokeswoman for the Royal Collection Trust said workers undertook extra roles voluntarily and were under no obligation to do so. She said: \u2018Warden staff are offered voluntary opportunities to receive training and develop skills to lead guided tours for visitors as part of their working day and to administer first aid, as well as to use their language skills. \u2018These are not compulsory aspects of their role, and it is the choice of the individual whether they wish to take part.\u2019 They said staff received a range of benefits including a 15 per cent non-contributory pension and a free lunch. She added: \u2018Royal Collection Trust continues to award wardens an annual performance-related pay increase of up to 2.5 per cent, in addition to the cost of living increase, as well as one-off payments to those who have reached the top of their pay scale.\u2019 The Royal Collection said it did not anticipate any interruption to tours in the event of industrial action. The Royal Collection website says its wardens enhance visitors\u2019 experiences by \u2018interpreting the exhibits, buildings and works of art whilst maintaining visitors\u2019 safety and security\u2019. It says: \u2018Whether you are greeting visitors at the start of their tour, carrying out security and baggage checks, or answering questions along the visitor route, you will be part of an impressive and unique experience.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\npublic and commercial services union said many are asked to go above.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far \u2014 and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship \u2014 Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . \u2018Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\u2019 said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. \u2018Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. \u2018At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. \u2018We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.\u2019 Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker\u00a0Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England\u2019s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster\u2019s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England\u2019s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: \u2018We don\u2019t control it. It\u2019s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.\u2019 England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . England practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle . Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship\u2019s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born. His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England\u2019s chances, despite Saturday\u2019s missed opportunities. Captain Chris Robshaw knows his side face a tough test against the French if they want to claim a crucial win . England duo Richard Wigglesworth (left) and Robshaw will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy . \u2018It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,\u2019 he said. \u2018We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress. \u2018We\u2019re happy with what we have created. Now it is just a case of doing the last bit. The easier bit is the finishing. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll work on.

The 45-year-old replaced Alex McLeish at the helm of the Premier League club in June 2012 but following a poor run of results, which left Villa in the bottom three, the club parted company with the Scot and later appointed Tim Sherwood as his successor. He told BBC's Football Focus: 'I don't have any bad things about Aston Villa. It's a brilliant football club as everybody knows. Paul Lambert says he only has 'good things' to say about Aston Villa despite his sacking in Feburary . Lambert believes Villa are in a healthier position than when he arrived, particularly in terms of their finances . 'I came in at really, probably a tough time and obviously when the financial reports came out, their losses are way down now so from that point of view the club is in probably a lot healthier position than when I went there. 'It's a great club with great people at it, and great people left behind. 'There's things when you look back and think \"maybe I should have done that better or different\" but I've got nothing but good things (to say) about the club.' Since leaving Villa, Lambert has spent time in Germany with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund working towards his UEFA Pro Licence. Lambert has spent time with Borussia Dortmund and Jurgen Klopp working towards his UEFA Pro Licence . Pep Guardiola is another manager in Germany that Lambert has been able to observe at close quarters of late . Although he enjoyed his time overseas and said his time spent there 'was a great experience', Lambert admitted he had no real plans to take up a managerial role abroad at this moment in time and follow the likes of former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes, who is head coach at Real Sociedad. When asked if he fancied managing overseas right now, the former Dortmund midfielder replied: 'Not really, I went over there - I've been back in the country for over a week or so now. 'The two clubs (Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich) there I know very well. Germany's been a big part of my life there but spending that time at Dortmund was a great experience and you learn so much, even though you're only there for that week or so to watch them....it was a great, great experience.' Lambert said he had no desire to follow\u00a0Real Sociedad head coach David Moyes in managing abroad . Lambert praised the work of Klopp and said that working with his Borussia Dortmund side was eye-opening . Sitting and talking with Guardiola was said to be a great experience for the former Aston Villa manager . Lambert praised the work Jurgen Klopp has done at the German club and admitted working and talking with the Dortmund coach and Bayern's Pep Guardiola was eye-opening. He added: '(Guardiola) and Jurgen Klopp are probably the best I've seen working. Just the way they can get the best out of people. 'I think meeting with him (Klopp) and Pep Guardiola was a great experience, to sit with them and talk to them. Defeat by Hull saw Lambert's Villa move into the relegation zone and he was subsequently sacked . Villa have improved under new manager Tim Sherwood but are still not too far off the Premier League drop . 'With Jurgen, I knew Jurgen from the Pro Licence, but to spend nine days with him was excellent. What you see on TV is what he's like as a guy....eccentric probably. He's a top, top guy and they way you see Borussia Dortmund now is probably due to him.' Lambert, who made 44 appearances playing for Dormund from 1996-1997 and helped them win the Champions League, said: 'Even though I'd played there - that was a massive football club - when I went back and watched them it's exploded really, really quickly and Jurgen has been a catalyst of what's happened.'

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nYears ago, when our house was always full of small children, I staggered downstairs with a couple of fellow mothers after a chaotic communal bath-time and found the visiting Dads pouring well-earned drinks. We reported that, just before we battened down the hatches, all the three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic and comparing the size of their willies. The mothers all laughed. So did the fathers, for a brief moment, but then, in chorus, they ask\u2122ed: \u2018Um . . . and whose was the . . .?\u2019 Civilized, cultured, happily married men, not a porn-hound or a libertine among them, but they couldn\u2019t help it. Willy-worship, willy-pride, is hard-wired deep in the male brain. However much they deny it, men do seem to care. Actors Jonny Lee Miller (left) and\u00a0Benedict Cumberbatch (right) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark-naked performances as Frankenstein a few years ago . Why else would King\u2019s College London have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure (one hopes not the hard, cold, sharp steel sort) and proudly report that the average length, unstimulated, is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect. I do admire the chaps\u2019 willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler. Brrr. But the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends. And that they all secretly, privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average. The academics explain that it\u2019s all about \u2018using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position\u2019, and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder, and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online. So, don\u2019t tell me men don\u2019t care. Further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing Frankenstein play at the National Theatre a few years ago, in which on alternate nights the role of the Creature, stark-naked during a long opening scene, was taken by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. Conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable, centring on who won that particular contest, and including the immortal line in a theatre-bar argument. \u2018Ah yes, I see what you mean, but is it a show-er or a grower?\u2019 We women edged away, to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being Dr Frankenstein. Libby says she blames author, Jilly Cooper (pictured), for giving men the impression that women are worried about size . Though to be fair, some of the girls were admiring the surrounding abs, pecs, and glutes. We do like a man who looks healthy. It\u2019s a primitive need in the female to bond with a man who is going to be able to take the bins out unaided. But honestly, hand on heart, I suspect that very few of us during early courtship \u2014 or afterwards, or even after the golden wedding \u2014 are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6in average. The idea that we are waiting with a ruler and a scornful frown for the kecks to come off is miles from reality. I blame author Jilly Cooper for giving men that impression, with all her crazed descriptions of things rearing up like the Tower of Pisa, or space shuttles, or \u2014 my least favourite \u2014 a \u2018joyous otter\u2019. I suppose the trouble is that writing sex scenes you have few choices. You can resort to heavy innuendo, or do some Barbara Cartland stuff about being carried away to heaven on wings of bliss. Or you can throw in the towel and pretend the female eye will only be delighted by the spectacle of something that would fit neatly into the London or Manhattan skyline, somewhere between Centrepoint and the Gherkin. Though ideally, of course, not the Shard. The porn industry is obsessed with size, but anyone with half a brain and heart knows porn has little to do with the reality of lovemaking. Most of us have never cared about size. We don\u2019t carry on like the fearsome coven on TV\u2019s Sex And The City, shriekingly comparing notes in the back of taxis or skinny-muffin cafes. It is worth noting, without comment, that much of the genius behind those series and films came from \u2014 ahem \u2014 men. Gay men, in many cases. Out here in the real world, that is not the way women carry on. The only ones I\u2019ve ever known talk about male size were sad, angry girls, unhappy in themselves about their failure to bond happily with any of the possessors of the said tackle. Libby is keen to point out that most women don't carry on like the women in Sex And The City (pictured), comparing detailed notes on the men they know . What we like is much harder to measure. I know a lot of women, and have been one for ages, and it\u2019s simpler than you think. We like hugs, we like tenderness, we like men who seem (often bafflingly) to be delighted and aroused by the very sight of us, even without make-up and a heavy cold. We really like to be laughed into bed and treated with affectionate consideration once we\u2019re there. We like men who think our enjoyment is at least half the point of the exercise, if not a bit more. We approve of chaps, of any dimension, who work out how to make the main event fun all round. We like men who chat and don\u2019t mind being rolled over when they snore or hauled around when they have hogged the duvet. We like faithfulness and kindness, and a man who loves to cuddle the baby even when it\u2019s leaking a bit. And we really like it when they grow out of caring about the 3.6in, or expecting it to be worshipped.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe three and four-year-old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics\u00a0in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships\u00a0certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper\u2019s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30 . BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES . Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process. The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves. A competitor in the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel plays handball in the mud flats of the River Elbe . A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It\u2019s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than \u20ac250,000. Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 . CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY . Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey\u2019s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you\u2019d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they\u2019re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair.\u00a0VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe annual wife carrying world championships appears to be a fun couple of days.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, is accused of using a phony social media account to kidnap 15-year-old Nichole Cable, of Glenburn, and kill her in May 2013. The Bangor Daily News\u00a0reports that Dube's ex-girlfriend Sarah Mersinger testified Monday that he told her he killed Nichole. Mersinger says Dube covered up Nichole's body with leaves and sticks. During an emotional testimony, she added: 'He told me that he strangled her at the end of her road. He said he put duct tape on her mouth, her eyes and on her hands and feet. Elaborate plot? Kyle Dube, 21, (pictured left in court last week) allegedly abducted Nichole Cable, 15, (right) in 2013 so that he could stage a rescue and be hailed as a hero. His ex-girlfriend has told a court he confessed to killing her and dumping her body in woodland in Bangor, Maine . 'He said he took her clothes off so the police dogs couldn\u2019t smell her.\u00a0He said he covered her with sticks and leaves, so they couldn\u2019t see her from the sky.' The court heard Mersinger would spend 18 or 19 days out of 21 at the house Dube shared with his parents and a four-year-old daughter from another relationship. Mersinger also told the jury that she had met Dube on Facebook, where they began messaging each other. They began dating in November 2012 but her mother didn\u2019t approve . Prosecutors say DNA evidence ties Dube to Nichole's disappearance. His attorneys say someone else killed the high school sophomore. Dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder, arguing that somebody else committed the crimes. During a court hearing last week, it was alleged Dube was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero. According to the prosecution, the bogus account was traced to his home, his DNA was found on a hat at the end of Nichole's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of Nichole's home. Accused: Prosecutors say Dube, pictured with his attorney during a hearing last Monday, left a hat with his DNA on it near Nichole's home . Defense attorney Wendy Hatch said last Monday that the state rushed to judge Dube, and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes. 'We are here to show you the state has holes in their case. They have mistakes, big mistakes,' Hatch told the jury, adding that Dube 'got up the next morning, got dressed, kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work.' Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber said Dube's DNA was also found on Cable's fingernails, and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared. He also said Dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense. 'Dube responded it was what he had done, that they didn't know he had done, that he was worried about,' Macomber said. Horrifying: The court heard Dube (mugshot left) covered Nichole's (right) body in leaves so she couldn't be seen from the sky and took her clothes off so police dogs couldn't smell her . The trial is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names. The case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in Old Town. Nichole's mother, Kristine Wiley, testified that she knew Dube as a friend of her daughter's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance. Between tears, she testified that Dube reached out to her with an offer to baby-sit her other children after Nichole vanished but before her body was found. Wiley said Dube first told her he had heard Wiley said he was responsible for Nichole's disappearance. Wiley said she denied the accusation and that Dube then told her 'if I needed anything, call' and that he would watch her other children for her. She said she never took him up on the offer.

Aubrey said she was told he would be eligible when he is five years old . Aubrey, 29, a mother-of-two, said she is heartbroken because she believes her son should have the freedom to be independent,  according to Fox News. The family submitted a claim for a wheelchair which was rejected in October. They resubmitted the claim which was also rejected a few weeks ago. On March 3, Aubrey wrote on Facebook that the claim had been denied. She wrote: 'I know that our son is only two but his mobility shouldn't be determined by a doctor that works for the insurance company, who has never met him. 'Crue is such an amazing and determined little boy and is capable of a lot more than they think. I don't know where he would be without his little ZipZac chair. That chair has given him his own independence and the ability to explore and learn on his own. 'He's been using that chair for almost two years now (no thanks to the insurance). I just wish that insurance companies would understand that if they gave young disabled children the chance to have mobility at a young age, the difference they'd be making in their lives. 'An able child learns to walk at the age of one so why is it not okay for a young disabled child to learn to use a chair at the age of two?' Crue, who was born with spina bifida, currently gets around in a $1,100 ZipZac, which is a small wheelchair that is low to the ground and often gets stuck on cracks in the sidewalk (Crue pictured above in his ZipZac wheelchair) Anthem Blue Cross has said the child's doctor is at fault for not submitting the required documents ahead of the legal deadline. 'Our records reflect that claim was denied because their doctor, despite efforts by Anthem to obtain this information, did not provide necessary documentation before the legal deadline to process a claim expired,' Darrel Ng, spokesman for Anthem Blue Cross told Fox News. The insurance company also said the family can appeal the decision that the chair is not necessary for Crue, according to ABC. The toddler's parents plan to appeal the decision and keep fighting for their son. Insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross, said the child's doctor is at fault for submitting the required documents in a timely fashion (above, Crue pictured in February during his routine kidney and bladder check up) Crue's parents plan to appeal the decision given by the insurance company and will keep fighting for their son (above Crue pictured in January enjoying sled hockey) Aubrey began sharing her son's story on Facebook, which led a close friend of theirs to start a donation\u00a0page to help raise funds so that Crue could have a new wheelchair. As their friend, Chanda Clark Steggell, was only intending to raise $10,000, by Saturday $15,995 had been raised in donations.

My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: \"What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?\" And \"Where is Paraguay, anyway?\" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen.

Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for \"The Missing Bourdain\" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film \"The Limey\" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's \"Parts Unknown\" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me.

Footage to be screened this evening on BBC1 focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows.

Beleaguered travellers have been warned that \u2018Easter is cancelled\u2019 as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed. On others they face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. Worst affected will be the West Coast main line, where Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. Scroll down for video . Passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects (file picture) The West Coast mainline, the Great Western and the Greater Anglia line are all planning works on key routes meaning passengers will face hours on rail replacement services or slower routes . The line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will have a four-day shutdown. On Easter Sunday a 55-minute direct trip from Rugby to London Euston will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes, with two trains and two buses. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: \u2018Easter is effectively cancelled \u2013 our line is shut. We\u2019re advising people not to travel. \u2018What makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering. This is unusual.\u2019 Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a  report has found . Other services blighted by engineering works include London Midland, which uses the same West Coast line and has issued a similar warning, and swathes of the Great Western and Greater Anglia lines. Virgin services to Manchester and the North West and Birmingham are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised for disruption from the \u00a3100million works by 14,000 engineering workers, but insisted it was vital. However, the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at Christmas when the key East Coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works, prompting a major inquiry, damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs, and a grovelling apology from rail bosses. Cancellations: The report found that\u00a0when work near King's Cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at Finsbury Park station but 'not enough was done' to manage passenger flow at the new station .

Don\u2019t get caught in planned improvement works.\u2019 It said there would not be any trains to or from London Euston, adding: \u2018There won\u2019t be any replacement shuttles either, so finding an alternative train service to London will be very difficult.\u2019 Engineering works on the line between Crewe and Warrington and from Carlisle to Glasgow will \u2018severely reduce services to the North and Scotland\u2019, it said. Services are also likely to be \u2018extra busy the day before and after affected days\u2019 and passengers should book early. West Coast passengers also face major works at Watford Junction from an \u00a381million programme from Network Rail \u2018to improve the ageing infrastructure\u2019. Rail bosses say carrying out works during Christmas and Easter is justified as passenger numbers are down by up to 40 per cent because there are far fewer commuters. But ministers have suggested carrying out such works at times other than at Christmas and Easter \u2013 such as through the summer \u2013 to avoid hitting families travelling during the key holiday periods. Mr Carne said: \u2018We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays to reunite with their friends and families, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period, but there will be disruption for some.\u2019 He insisted that there were \u2018good contingency plans in place\u2019 while the improvements are carried out.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbritain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

In a statement released on Monday, the league announced that the Falcons have been fined $350,000 (\u00a3237,000)\u00a0and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft. If the Falcons have multiple picks in that round, the highest selection will be forfeited. Team president Rich McKay has also been suspended from the league's Competition Committee beginning April 1. Atlanta Falcons have been fined \u00a3237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome . Owner Arthur Blank acknowledged the team's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . The NFL noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the Falcons violated league rules that state 'at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.' The league also said Roddy White, the team's former director of event marketing, was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club. The Falcons fired him. The league determined that Falcons ownership and senior executives, including McKay, were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise. But as the senior club executive overseeing game operations, McKay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules. McKay can petition Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than June 30. The Falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Falcons president Rick McKay has been suspended from his position on NFL Competition Committee . Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in early February that he had seen enough of the NFL's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club. 'It's not really a fine line,' Blank said. 'I think what we've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong. Anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field, we're opposed to, as a league, as a club and as an owner. It's obviously embarrassing but beyond embarrassing it doesn't represent our culture and what we're about.' The Falcons say 101 of 103 games have been sellouts since Blank bought the team in 2002. Actual turnouts declined during losing seasons the last two years. Atlanta ranked 10th among the 32 NFL teams with its average home attendance of 72,130 in 2014.

The woman confesses: 'I'd meet up with men just to have sex. They wouldn't even have to take me to dinner first. You don't want to get too full before a bedroom romp, after all.' Celebrities linked to the controversial condition include Russell Brand, Michael Douglas and Tiger Woods, who are all reported to have sought professional treatment. 'It's not so bad when you're in a monogamous relationship because you always have someone to get your fix with,' the woman writes. 'You don't have to worry about catching anything because of your addiction.' She comments that if she had the time she'd sneak off to the bathrooms to alleviate her urges and says there are little 'key-ring vibrators' that can be used in an emergency. She also mentions the guilt and shame she feels and how men are meant to be the ones obsessed with sex rather than women. Michael Douglas was widely reported to have a sex addiction when he was admitted to rehab in 1990. The Hollywood actor finally admitted the claims in his 2012 biography. American actor David Duchovny admitted to having a sex addiction and checked into rehab for treatment in August 2008. Tiger Woods reportedly checked into a clinic for sex addiction treatment following the breakdown of his marriage in 2009. In his memoir My Booky Wook Russell Brand admitted to suffering from an addiction to heroin and sex, and booked into rehab to treat his addiction to \u2018carnal overindulgences\u2019. In her 2007 confessional documentary for Channel 4 entitled Am I A Sex Addict?

Sunglasses? Check. Twenty-four degree heat? Check. Now all I need is a fruity cocktail and I could be in Mauritius. Except I\u2019m not on holiday. I\u2019m in a basement in central London, moments from the frenzy of Oxford Street. Outside, it\u2019s a typical day \u2014 cold and damp, with a sky as grey and heavy as old army boots. It\u2019s estimated that two million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which is caused by a lack of sunlight - and up to three times more women than men appear to be affected . Down here, amid the lemon trees and pink, plastic bougainvillea, it\u2019s so tropical that I half expect Barry Manilow to cha-cha-cha past singing the Copacabana. Welcome to the cheapest winter sunspot in Britain. This is a \u2018Real Sunlight\u2019 clinic, where anyone can drop in for a burst of cheering warmth. But you don\u2019t have to face the airport, and it won\u2019t cost you thousands of pounds. At the flick of a switch, you can flit between Mauritius, Miami and Bali \u2014 or, at least, their sunshine equivalents. Dr Daya (pictured) originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winter . As holidays go, it\u2019s pretty convenient: no passport, no packing and the weather is guaranteed. It\u2019s estimated that 2 million Britons suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), caused by a lack of sunlight, with up to three times more women than men affected. Symptoms include low-level depression, lack of energy and a loss of enthusiasm for life. The syndrome is so widespread, the NHS has set up a web page giving advice on how to tackle it \u2014 which includes artificial sun. In the past, if you were down in the dumps during winter, the advice would be to buck up or buy a ticket somewhere hot. But what if you can\u2019t afford to? What if you\u2019re trapped on this cold, damp isle until the spring, whenever that may be? It was only when a colleague cheerfully announced that he was off to Goa, in India, for a fortnight that I thought, hang on, I need some sunshine, too! Which is how I found myself slipping on my flip-flops at Dr Daya\u2019s Wholistic Medical Centre on that Monday afternoon. Dr Daya is the sort of GP you find a lot of around Harley Street. A private practitioner, she\u2019s open to alternative medicine, \u2018taking a holistic approach, looking at the whole body and lifestyle, not just one part of it\u2019. Prince Charles would approve. Hers is the only clinic in Britain to offer a \u2018real sunshine\u2019 room to the public. It opened in 2009, though she has just moved premises and spruced it up. It\u2019s a normal-sized sitting room, done up to feel like a tropical holiday. The walls are papered with verdant scenes and artificial grass, jaunty pot plants hang off wooden screens, soothing music plays in the background. In a corner, above your head, beams the \u2018artificial sun\u2019. It looks like a row of wall-mounted security lights \u2014 three square boxes, the sort you might get at a football stadium. Dr Daya's Wholistic Medical Centre (pictured) in central London where you can experience the Miami sun . The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya \u00a325,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box \u2014 which beams out an assimilation of natural light \u2014 for \u00a350. \u2018Light boxes do work,\u2019 says Dr Daya, \u2018but this is out of this world. This is the full spectrum \u2014 infra-red, UVA, UVB and you get the heat, whereas with SAD boxes, you just get visible light.\u2019 The inventor of the equipment, Ingemar Nilsson, stumbled upon his creation by mistake in 1997. Commissioned to create a sunlight tunnel for Swedish car manufacturer Saab to test the effects of the sun\u2019s rays on different paints, he noticed that the factory workers liked to congregate under the sun lamps during their breaks. He realised people could get benefits from sitting under the artificial sunlight he\u2019d created. So he spent some years adapting his equipment to make it 100 per cent safe for human use, and ten years later had created the technology he sells now. Initially, the biggest demand for sunlight rooms came from the elderly and nursing homes. The first private sunlight room was created in Sweden, and there have now been 150 installations worldwide. In Britain, 11 have been installed in care homes and there are three belonging to private individuals. \u2018Some people really go to town with replicating a holiday feel for their sunlight rooms,\u2019 says Karl Emanuelsson, the UK company representative. \u2018People put sand on the floor, surround sound systems to replicate the sea, the smell of coconut wafting through to create a truly multi-sensory experience.\u2019 Dr Daya originally bought the equipment for her own use, having grown sick of British winters. \u2018I was born in Africa and I really need the sun,\u2019 she says. \u2018I don\u2019t think you need to have been born in Africa to feel you\u2019re missing the sun here, but that was my excuse. \u2018When I was 13, I was sent from Tanzania to boarding school here, and I still can\u2019t get over how long the winters are.\u2019 A woman looks at a ' light lounge' - a treatment aimed at Seasonal Affective Disorder sufferers (SAD) Back in Tanzania, which lies on the Equator, there is an average of 2,836 hours of sun per year, out of a possible 4,383. In Britain, the average is typically less than half that, ranging from 1,364 per year in Birmingham to 1,888 in Eastbourne. Dr Daya had heard of sunlight simulators in spas and health clinics, and decided to buy one for herself. \u2018I thought it was a bit extravagant, and that I should really share it with other people, so I opened the sun room,\u2019 she says. She charges \u00a350 for a one-hour session, which seems a lot to spend on an hour under a hot lamp \u2014 but, on the other hand, it\u2019s less than the cost of a holiday and, as soon as you flick the switch, you\u2019re hit in the face with that lovely, warm feeling, as if you\u2019ve just stepped off a plane in the Caribbean. There are three settings: an hour of \u2018Bali\u2019 is the mildest, equivalent to a long sunset, while \u2018Miami\u2019, Dr Daya\u2019s favourite, is 45 minutes of full whack, then 15 minutes of winding down. She finds \u2018Mauritius\u2019 is the most popular, as it\u2019s the strongest, so that\u2019s what I plump for. And, boy, do those lamps give off light. Not just light, but heat. In seconds, the room is toasty warm, and I\u2019m breaking into a sweat. You can wear what you like \u2014 Dr Daya likes to spend an hour here after work, in her underwear, catching up with reading. Some visit as couples, while others pop in for a solitary hour in their lunch break. But what are the actual health benefits? We know we get a large part of our vitamin D intake \u2014 important for the promotion of calcium and healthy bones \u2014 from the sun. Some of our intake also comes from food such as oily fish. But from October to April, 90 per cent of the UK lies too far north to have enough UVB rays in sunlight necessary to make vitamin D in the skin. So, if they\u2019re not eating enough oily fish and are spending too much time indoors, many are at risk of being vitamin D deficient. Which is where a burst in a sunny room could be just the ticket. But just a burst \u2014 and no more. There\u2019s a risk of getting skin cancer if you spend too much time in the room. \u2018The recommended dose is no more than one hour a day, which is completely safe,\u2019 says Dr Daya. \u2018But if you did three hours every day, we couldn\u2019t vouch for the effects. 'It\u2019s like anything \u2014 it\u2019s important not to overdo it.\u2019 Dr Daya claims her time in the sun room makes her sleep better and feel more energetic during the day. And one elderly user of a nursing home sunlight room says it helps alleviate aches and pains, especially joints, and has a positive effect on his brain power \u2014 it helps him tackle the crossword much quicker. After leaving Dr Daya\u2019s clinic, I do feel more cheerful and friends say I have a rosy complexion, compared with my normal pasty, winter face. I ask Dr Daya if she still feels the need to go on holiday. \u2018Who wants to go on holiday when you can have one every day in your office?\u2019 she replies. Good point. Even so, I could still do with a week in Mauritius. The equipment comes from Sweden and cost Dr Daya \u00a325,000 to install, which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box, which beams out an assimilation of natural light, like this one, the Lumie Zip for \u00a3150 .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nit's a typical day -- cold and damp, with a sky as old army boots.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Malcolm Hibbert had been single for many years when he met Karen Hughes, 50,\u00a0in December 2011 while he still was living with his widowed mother Ruth, in Burnley, Lancashire. Burnley Crown Court was told the couple never lived together but would see each other several times a week and she had keys to his property. But within months of his mother dying and leaving him \u00a356,000 inheritance, the majority of the money was gone\u00a0after Hughes callously seized control of her boyfriend's finances and splashed \u00a320,000 of it on herself. Malcolm Hibbert had been single for many years when he met Karen Hughes, 50, in December 2011 while he was living with his widowed mother Ruth, in Burnley, Lancashire. \u00a0In September 2012, Mrs Hibbert, 84, passed away and left him with an inheritance of \u00a356,000 - the majority of which Hughes plundered . In September 2012, Mrs Hibbert, 84, passed away and left him with the inheritance which she built up with her late husband Alan who died aged 74 in 2003. Despite living on state benefits, Hughes splashed out on a string of 'staycation' seaside holidays in the UK for herself and 60-year old Mr Hibbert while secretly pocketing almost \u00a320,000 of the legacy for herself. In one three month period it is believed Hughes spent \u00a316,462 playing fixed odds betting terminals - dubbed the 'crack cocaine of gambling' - at her local bookmakers, and used Mr Hibbert's cash to pay Wonga loans and set up internet accounts with Argos, Littlewoods and Next. Mr Hibbert, an only child, had lived with his parents for his whole life and knew little about finance. He told court he had only discovered the money was missing when he went to his bank to ask why transactions had been blocked - and was told there was only \u00a310,000 left of the nest egg. The court heard that Hughes ended their relationship when she was asked about the money. Despite living on state benefits, Hughes splashed out on a string of 'staycation' seaside holidays in the UK for herself and 60-year old Mr Hibbert while secretly pocketing almost \u00a320,000 of the legacy for herself . Mr Hibbert, a delivery driver, condemned his former girlfriend as she was jailed for 18 months. He said: 'I was taken for a ride in the cruelest way possible. 'I had only just lost my mum but Karen suddenly got more involved in my life and was arranging the funeral and everything. She became my rock. I am normally very cautious with money but she wormed her way in and virtually spent the lot. I went into the bank one day and when I couldn't get any money, they told me there was lot of unusual spending habits and showed what was left. It knocked me for six. 'I just didn't have a clue what she was up to. I thought we would have been sweethearts for life but it looks like ultimately she was only after me for my money. I feel like I've been taken for a mug.' Stephen Parker prosecuting said Mr Hibbert was not a wealthy man but even before the inheritance became available in March 2013 Hughes had 'very quickly' taken control of her boyfriend's finances and set up an online bank account for him. In one day alone \u00a31,300 was taken out of Mr Hibbert's account. On the day the inheritance money was paid, Hughes paid herself \u00a35,760 followed by payments of \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,450. She also set up accounts with Wonga, Argos, Littlewoods and Next on the internet using his name and made purchases . The couple went to Blackpool six times as well as Scarborough, the Lake District and Cornwall where they went to football matches, restaurants on railway trips and even and a speedboat jaunt. She would book the holidays then pay for them with his money after he asked her to action his bills for him. But Hughes also used his cash to make card payments to William Hill and took out loans with Wonga to cover the transactions. In one day alone \u00a31,300 was taken out of Mr Hibbert's account. On the day the inheritance money was paid, Hughes paid herself \u00a35,760 followed by payments of \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,450. She also set up accounts with Wonga, Argos, Littlewoods and Next on the internet using his name and made purchases. Mr Parker said: 'Mr Hibbert is a man who had always lived with his parents.. His parents had always done his accounting and taken care of his finances. He had always lived with his mother. His father died several years... 'The defendant herself said he didn't have a clue of finances or computers. 'He had little or no understanding of banking and how it worked because his mother had control in relation to his finances. In terms of monies, he had somewhere between \u00a310,000-15,000 of his own money in savings other than the inheritance that he received, held in various accounts. She claims said she was never told to not spend the money - and would show him receipts after withdrawing from the cash point. She also said Mr Hibbert would ask her to marry him on a daily basis . 'She didn't consider her actions dishonest and said he would probably have let her take the money if she asked. This was more than just a breach of trust because of his vulnerability He was heavily dependant on her, the degree of trust was higher.' The money went missing between January 2013 to July 2013 before Hughes was arrested. She admitted that she had dealt with his financial matters and bills and said that the transactions were both for her sole use and for their joint use. But she claims said she was never told not to spend the money \u00a0- and would show him receipts after withdrawing from the cash point. She also said Mr Hibbert would ask her to marry him on a daily basis. In a victim impact statement Mr Hibbert said he felt 'frightened' and often had trouble sleeping and would 'sit around the house for days end, crying on a daily basis'. He added that he had been grateful when Hughes had helped him after his mother's death but as a result of what happened felt 'hurt and betrayed'. He no longer enjoyed life and was struggling to focus on anything else and had made him 'sink further into his shell'. Santander have since refunded him all the money. Hughes, from Lancaster, who showed no emotion in court, admitted theft and fraud. She had previous convictions for chequebook fraud and served a nine month prison sentence in 1993. In mitigation defence lawyer Anthony Parkinson said Hughes had 'significant gambling issues' and said her habit began during a previous relationship as 'some sort of escapism from that daily life'. He added: 'These offences would not have been committed had that money not been readily available. This gambling problem has always been in her life and was the whole motivation. Essentially she doesn't have \u00a32 to rub together, she never did. She is not a lady who lived a lavish lifestyle. She is remorseful and bitterly regrets her actions.' Passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Stephen Riordan QC told Hughes: 'Whether or not you knew that inheritance was coming I do not know. 'But you began plundering his bank account on a regular basis even before the inheritance arrived in his account. He trusted you to look after his affairs for him and you knew perfectly well he was not ever going to check on what you were doing. 'I have little doubt if it had not been discovered you would have gone on plundering his account until it was empty. The affect on him was devastating. He'd had no effective relationship for many years if at all, naturally enough he became dependent on you. You have let him down. 'You have mercilessly stolen from him over a period of time.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ncouple never lived together but would see each other times a week.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: \u2018These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it\u2019s all about submission and domination when of course it isn\u2019t. \u2018People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I\u2019m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.\u2019 This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said \u2018it\u2019s worse now, but I\u2019m an old person so I would say that.\u2019 She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that \u2018it\u2019s a huge problem in society.\u2019 Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine\u2019s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society\u2019s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: \u2018There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. They didn\u2019t have sex education, mainly at schools.\u2019 Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers\u2019 \u2018big sister\u2019 imparting advice. This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers\u2019 queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them. Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm . He told the programme: \u2018Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You\u2019re in an odd position, where you\u2019re meddling in strangers\u2019 lives and you\u2019re judging a whole situation by one side, you don\u2019t get the other side. \u2018Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy. \u2018Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don\u2019t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.\u2019 One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes. She said: \u2018There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe current generation of young people is the most confused about sex.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $69 round-trip fares in April and May that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply. Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act. \"We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,\" reads the offer on Spirit's website. \"It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.\" Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. \"You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked,\" wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis. Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture. \"Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. We enjoy being different than other airlines,\" said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications. \"When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.  But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. They get lots of attention,\" he added. \"The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently.\" The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday. Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights. Based in Florida, Spirit Airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can. The airline's defense is simple: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want.

My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: \"What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?\" And \"Where is Paraguay, anyway?\" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for \"The Missing Bourdain\" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film \"The Limey\" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's \"Parts Unknown\" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nBeing in the right place at the right time is a mark of a successful Formula One driver \u2014 a truism that will almost certainly lead Lewis Hamilton to agree a new deal at Mercedes, possibly within the week. The double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to McLaren in the early years and then moving to Mercedes for the 2013 season, despite the aristocracy of British motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team. The importance of making the correct decision was reinforced on the podium after Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, when he saw Sebastian Vettel on the top step after the German\u2019s own successful move from Red Bull to Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton sits on the podium alongside Sebastian Vettel after he claimed his first victory for Ferrari . Hamilton, out of contract at the end of the season, says his new Mercedes deal will be completed this week . Hamilton, who finished second, also thought of Fernando Alonso, whose career management has been disastrous since he left Renault in 2005, the year he won the last of his two world titles. The Spaniard then walked out on McLaren when he could have won a third championship, went back to Renault as a stop-gap, joined Ferrari while it was moribund and returned to McLaren this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners Honda. Alonso managed less than half of Sunday\u2019s race before a cooling problem intervened. Vettel, in only his second race for Ferrari, won in the car Alonso had just vacated. \u2018It\u2019s nice to see Ferrari back up,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I sat next to Sebastian and thought to myself, \u201cWhat is Fernando thinking?\u201d I remember when I left McLaren and came here, we were better the next year. I had a good feeling then, but he\u2019s almost done the opposite of what I did. It could have been him today. It\u2019s just strange how things turn out. Hamilton finished behind race-winner Vettel in Sepang but still remains in the lead of the world championship . Hamilton led Vettel off the start-line at the Malaysian Grand Prix but eventually lost out to the German . \u2018McLaren are a fantastic team. It looks bad now but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get it together. Before you know it, it will be the three of us fighting, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u2019 Alonso\u2019s predicament is a terrible shame because he was the heir who supplanted Michael Schumacher as the German approached his first retirement in 2009. Hamilton, 30, does not want to fall into the same trap, and says he is ready to sign a new contract with Mercedes for three more years beyond this season. The tantalising prospect of his joining Ferrari, where he is hugely admired by president Sergio Marchionne, seems remote. They have Vettel and Hamilton is already part of a top team. No matter Sunday\u2019s result \u2014 Hamilton beaten on pure pace by Vettel\u2019s Ferrari \u2014 Mercedes are the team of the moment. Asked about signing for Ferrari, Hamilton said: \u2018No, don\u2019t be silly. My contract at Mercedes should be done this week. There\u2019s no reason why not. Honestly, it\u2019s 99.6 per cent done.\u2019 Hamilton is expected to earn more than his current annual \u00a320million salary when he pens his new deal . The exact terms of drivers\u2019 contracts are kept secret, but it is thought that Hamilton will get more than his current annual \u00a320million salary, though probably not match Vettel\u2019s deal at Ferrari, which could be worth up to \u00a335m if he collects all his bonuses and extras. The Mercedes board want their team to be cost-efficient and will not pay the Earth even for a driver of Hamilton\u2019s talent. As well as tying up the contract, Mercedes will spend the fortnight before the next race in China responding to the Ferrari challenge. It is believed that the cooler temperatures expected in Shanghai will favour Mercedes, but at least their defeat after eight successive wins relieved the monotony. \u2018I don\u2019t think Ferrari\u2019s win is a one-off,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I don\u2019t think they were lucky or it was a fluke. There\u2019s always talk that they are easier on their tyres. \u2018I think we\u2019ll manage. We\u2019ve got a great group of people, a great approach, and from this we\u2019ll take a step back. \u2018Second for me and third for Nico (Rosberg) is still good but they\u2019re too close to us in the championship, so we\u2019ll work very hard to analyse. It was not a kick; it was a pinch. We have now got a race on our hands.\u2019 That is good news for the sport and hope for all the teams.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nlewis hamilton claimed his first victory for ferrari.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: \u2018These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it\u2019s all about submission and domination when of course it isn\u2019t. \u2018People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I\u2019m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.\u2019 This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said \u2018it\u2019s worse now, but I\u2019m an old person so I would say that.\u2019 She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that \u2018it\u2019s a huge problem in society.\u2019 Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine\u2019s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society\u2019s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: \u2018There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. They didn\u2019t have sex education, mainly at schools.\u2019 Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers\u2019 \u2018big sister\u2019 imparting advice. This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers\u2019 queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them. Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm . He told the programme: \u2018Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You\u2019re in an odd position, where you\u2019re meddling in strangers\u2019 lives and you\u2019re judging a whole situation by one side, you don\u2019t get the other side. \u2018Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy. \u2018Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don\u2019t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.\u2019 One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes. She said: \u2018There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe current generation is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women\u2019s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group ...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba\u2019i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I\u2019m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview . The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won\u2019t have time for other questions. 'Now, it\u2019s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: \u201cYou can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her . Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air . Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I). Her first book Tonight I will Confess has received critical acclaim in literary circles and she is now the host for Bidoun Zaal, where she interviews public figures and discusses issues related to society, politics and religion. London-based Sheik Hani Al-Siba'i is Director of London's Al-Maqreze Centre for Historical Studies Hani Sibai. He has previously claimed that \u2018anyone who is not a Muslim is a criminal\u2019 and is seen as a controversial figure who has often made offensive comments in interviews. Speaking to Al-Jazeera TV on July 8, 2005, the Sheik caused great outrage by saying that the London bombings were a victory: \u2018If Al-Qaeda indeed carried out this act [of the bombings], it is a great victory for it. It rubbed the noses of the world's eight most powerful countries in the mud.\u2019 The row comes as global views on women\u2019s rights face more scrutiny than ever before. Last month, a manifesto - reportedly written by an all-women Islamic State militia - advised that nine is a good age to consider marriage for girls, who should have husbands by 16. It also said women must stay behind closed doors, be veiled and only leave the house in exceptional circumstances. While in India, a documentary caused outrage last week in which convicted rapist Mukesh Singh blamed his victim Jyoti Singh for the attack.

'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old b\u00eate noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

They say the former prime minister has blood on his hands after sending their sons to war and should be facing an inquiry instead. Mr Blair and his successor Gordon Brown will be among the 2,000-strong congregation at a commemoration service at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Meet the troops: Tony Blair poses with British forces in 2003 after he took the country to war in Iraq . Politicians, royalty, military chiefs and serving soldiers are on the guest list. But fewer than half of the 2,000 places have been given to the families of the 453 war dead \u2013 who are limited to two seats each. Relatives said it was \u2018horrific\u2019 that Mr Blair and Mr Brown should have a place, while many family members of those who died did not. Bob Wright, 68, whose son Corporal Mark Wright was killed in an unmarked minefield in September 2006, said: \u2018He (Tony Blair) is the last person I would want to see. He would have some cheek going. He took the country to war, and cost all of those lives and he\u2019s got blood on his hands.\u2019 Grandmother Joan Humphreys, 70, said it was \u2018horrific\u2019 Mr Blair had been invited but she had not.

Mr Sadler said his 21-year-old son Jack was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007, while Mr Brown was PM. He said: \u2018I\u2019m hoping Gordon Brown doesn\u2019t stand up and say anything because he has lots of questions to answer.\u2019 Roadside bomb: Jack Sadler was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007 . Mr Blair sent troops to Afghanistan to oust the Taliban and kill Osama Bin Laden following the September 11 attacks in 2001. But the decision sparked widespread condemnation after the war dragged on for 13 years and led to hundreds of British deaths. There was outrage when he sent UK troops to Iraq in 2003. Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in 2007, with the last of Britain\u2019s troops withdrawing from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

The man has stashed the shoes all over his unit, filling up cupboards with the footwear and forming massive piles in corners of his house . Although there were over 1000 pairs of shoes, the man was reportedly only ever seen wearing one pair of shoes. His only explanation to police was that 'he just liked shoes'. 'They were in his kitchen cupboards, under his sinks, they were in the cupboards above the sink,' Leading Senior Constable Baker told The Age. In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom . Police found about 600 pairs of shoes piled high under his bed and he stacked them so high that the windows in the bedroom could not be opened . 'It really looks like he's just an old man, who is harmless. He's never been in trouble with the police before and he's just got a fascination with shoes.' 'This is just purely someone who likes shoes,' he said.

'If you have had shoes stolen in the Kilsyth and Mooroolbark area you are invited to attend the Mooroolbark Police station on Sunday 29 March between 11am-4pm to see if the shoe fits you,' they said.

Five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City and it could prove more tense and exciting than the Barclays Premier League title race itself. Adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join Europe\u2019s elite next season must swallow an estimated \u00a330million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish . Louis van Gaal said that he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total . \u2018The best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can,\u2019 said Arsenal manager Wenger. \u2018You can see the quality of the teams behind us. Seventy-two points might be enough. \u2018People have finished in the top four with 67 points, but if you look at this year, we have 51 points, so it will be in the 70s. It is a tough run-in, similar to last year.\u2019 Arsenal finished fourth last year with 79 points, well clear of Everton in fifth with 72. It is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years. When Everton came fourth in 2005, they had 61 points ahead of Liverpool in fifth with 58. In each of the past two years, however, the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points. Van Gaal acknowledged Wenger\u2019s years of expertise in the area. \u2018I want to believe him,\u2019 said the Manchester United boss. \u2018It is a rat race. It is going into the last week.\u2019 Arsenal have not given up hope of catching City to finish second, but there is a nine-point gap to Chelsea who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top. Wenger said: \u2018We are nowhere near close to being in the title race. We are too far from Chelsea to say that we are in the title race, but you never know what can happen. \u2018Why should Manchester City give up for the title? They did it before from eight points behind.

ARSENAL . Suffered a Euro wobble but form is strong in the Premier League, winning six of seven since defeat at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day, after which Wenger switched goalkeepers. Attention is spread over three competitions, although maybe not for long.\u00a0They trail Monaco 1-3 in the Champions League and go to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They are awash with goals, have key players fit and options to make changes, especially up front. Also experienced top-four finishers, with an eye still on catching Manchester City. Top 7 games to play: 3. Prediction: 76pts. Wayne Rooney has returned to an attacking role since Robin van Persie's injury and has performed well there . MANCHESTER UNITED . Results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of Robin van Persie\u2019s injury has moved Wayne Rooney back up front which may prove serendipitous. But they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures, with five of the top seven to play and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle. Away form is poor, with 16 points on the road this season \u2014 the worst in top half barring West Ham. Fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals, but more likely a problem with form so sluggish. Should at least be fresh, having only played 32 games in all competitions. Top 7 games: 5. Prediction: 71pts. Liverpool have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat Manchester City . LIVERPOOL . Finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start. Helped by a settled system, the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Steven Gerrard. They boast the best form in the Premier League since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past. They also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more Europe, but finish with awkward away games at Chelsea and Stoke. No sign of fatigue but Burnley is their 45th game of the season. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 73pts. Morgan Schneiderlin has impressed for Southampton this season as the Saints surprised everyone . SOUTHAMPTON . Scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager Ronald Koeman since the end of January, as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing Champions League qualification and are plotting to stop them. Perhaps this, together with increased expectations, is catching up with them after a brilliant start. Injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which cannot boast the same depth as others pursuing the Champions League. The dream faded during February, a month when Saints scored once in five games, but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 61pts.

In a mini-slump after five without a win in all competitions and bruised by a Europa League exit and Wembley defeat inside three days.

Speaking outside his home in Chiswick, west London, he told how the shock hit him as Murray made the joke to Eurosport presenter Annabel Croft. The 29-year-old told MailOnline: 'It's just a bit of banter that went wrong. Andy thought he was going to have a laugh and put me in the spotlight but he didn't realise I had just started a relationship. 'We thought there was a girl that might have the hots for me and boys like to take things out of hand, but there's nothing to it whatsoever. 'But I was like \"oh my god, now my girlfriend's going to think I've actually done something\". 'But I called her up and said what had happened and within two minutes we were laughing about it. 'I explained that Andy likes messing with his team and that's what makes this team really close together.

The British No 1 went down 6-2, 6-3 in 88 minutes to his direct contemporary on Saturday in the latest match of what has begun to look like a one-sided rivalry. The 27 year-old Serb\u2019s victory not only put him into the final of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, it also represented his ninth victory out of 10 against Murray, the exception being the 2013 Wimbledon final. British No1 Andy Murray crashes out of BNP Paribas semi-final at Indian Wells after losing to Novak Djokovic . Murray plays a shot during his semi-final match against Djokovic in Indian Wells on Saturday . Djokovic celebrates his win over Murray that sees the Serb progress to the final of the BNP Paribas Open . Djokovic and Murray meet at the net following their quick semi-final in California on Saturday . And Murray said: \u2018The frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets. Novak didn\u2019t give me any free points at the beginning of either set and I made a few too many errors early on. \u2018At the end of both sets, I started to play a bit better and made it tougher and was able to push him a bit, but not enough at the beginning of the sets to make it challenging enough for him.\u2019 Djokovic was in sublime form and Murray\u2019s only chance appeared to be to serve outstandingly well, which he did not. On the kind of medium-slow hard court that is so commonplace on the ATP Tour the world No 1, when fully prepared and motivated, looks irresistible. Djokovic said: \u2018I tried to start with the right intensity, I got a crucial break at the start. Andy made a lot of unforced errors, his first-serve percentage was low. I\u2019m sure he knows I\u2019m returning well, I know he\u2019s returning well, so that puts added pressure on our serving.\u2019 Murray's caoch Amelie Mauresmo watches on from the stands in Indian Wells . Djokovic will play either Roger Federer or Milos Raonic in the final on Sunday . There was nothing in the way of the aggravation that marked their last meeting, the Australian Open final, where Murray looked like he was getting the upper hand before his opponent started hamming up his physical state and the Scot became distracted. That was part of what has been, by and large, a decent start to the season for Murray, but his problem remains that Djokovic plays in a similar fashion to him and does it decisively better. Murray had been in impressive form over the past 10 days while Djokovic enjoyed a walkover in his scheduled quarter-final against Bernard Tomic. And Djokovic will now face Roger Federer in Sunday's final after the Swiss came through his semi-final against Rafa Nadal\u2019s conqueror, Miles Raonic. Federer beat the Canadian 7-5, 6-4, finally finding the break he needed in the 11th game of the first set. He clinched the opener with a forehand winner, then broke Raonic\u2019s serve again at the start of the second set. Raonic, enticed to the net repeatedly by Federer only to see power strokes whizz past him, struggled against Federer\u2019s serve and the world No 2 completed the victory with a volley at the net. Murray trudges off the court after his 6-2, 6-3 defeat in Indian Wells .

Kai Hibbard worked on her book 'Too Fat, Too Thin, Can't Win' with Deborah Baer, according to the New York Daily News. Hibbard's book will reportedly detail what happens behind the scenes of 'The Biggest Loser,' which has aired for 16 seasons. Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season. Speaking out: Kai Hibbard (seen left and right)\u00a0has reportedly penned an expose on'The Biggest Loser.' Hibbard\u00a0finished as the runner-up during the show's third season . A source in the book industry told the Daily News 'The show didn't invent fat-shaming, but exploits it. Her proposal was so juicy. It has a bigger, more important message about weight and health.' According to the newspaper, Hibbard's book claims that 'The Biggest Loser' refused to purchase new underwear for contestants, whose underwear drooped as the pounds came off. The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct. I hope more than a \"tell all\" that when all is said and done it stands as a statement on the media, society and how shame is not a motivator but a paralytic from someone who has regretfully been there and done that.' Remarks: Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster' Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment. She recently told the\u00a0New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I\u2019m embarrassed to have participated in.' She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, \"You\u2019re going die before your children grow up.\" \"You\u2019re going to die, just like your mother.\" \"We\u2019ve picked out your fat-person coffin\" - that was in a text message. One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised.

There were not many clamouring for the 21-year-old to be in the Spurs starting line-up at the start of the season, never mind the national team. Now, though, Kane is one of the most talked about players in the country as his Roy of the Rovers rise continues apace. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has insisted he is fully focused on helping the club progress this season . Kane rounds QPR goalkeeper Robert Green to score his second goal in a 2-1 win on Sunday at Loftus Road . Kane has now scored 26 goals in 41 appearances for Spurs in all competitions so far this season . Saturday's brace in Spurs' 2-1 win at QPR increased his goal tally to 26 in all competitions - a remarkable haul which is likely to earn a first senior call-up this month. Roy Hodgson could not fail but to be impressed by Kane's latest display, but front man is trying not to think about the potential of facing Lithuania or Italy this month. 'I've always said, I've got to keep doing what I am doing,' he said. 'There are still a few more games until the international break and I want to do the best I can for Tottenham Hotspur. 'That's what I am looking to do. I want to get some more wins from until then and, yeah, we'll see what happens. 'Obviously, I've just got to keep doing what I am doing. 'I think any English player playing would love to play for England. It would be a dream but there are a lot of great players in England. 'I just have to keep concentrating and doing the best I can for Spurs. We'll see what happens.' Kane is widely being tipped for a call up to the England team following his impressive form for Spurs . Kane lashes a shot at the QPR goal only for Hoops defender Steven Caulker (left) to get in the way . That determination to continue impressing at club level is certainly helping Spurs get over a disappointing few weeks. The north Londoners' Europa League exit was compounded by defeat to Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final, but they responded impressively with back-to-back victories over Swansea and QPR. 'That is massive,' Kane told Sky Sports. 'That is what we said. 'We had a disappointing couple of weeks, going out of the Europa and obviously losing the final, so we knew we had to get back on it, build a bit of momentum and get as far up in the league as we can. 'We have managed to do that with two very important wins and hopefully we can continue it.' This latest victory moves Tottenham within three points of the top-four, while it leaves QPR deeper in the mire. The west Londoners have now lost seven of their last eight top-flight matches, with relegation edging closer by the week. Again, though, manager Chris Ramsey defended his players' application and, in particular, Rio Ferdinand. The former England international was culpable for both goals, leading to chants from the away end of 'It's time to retire' - something a smattering of home fans joined in with. 'I think Rio's applied himself well,' Ramsey said. 'I'm very pleased with the way he played. 'In the position we're in, when goals go in people will always get blamed or people look at some more than others. 'For Rio to be the age he is and applying himself the way he is in training and in games, we need to encourage him. 'It's always disappointing when a goal goes in, and you can always break it down and analyse it to its finest points. The players involved will always be disappointed.'

The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by\u00a0Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012. Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas . Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at\u00a0John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, \"That\u2019s not me\" but I had my mum round and she said, \"That is you.\" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson\u2019s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman\u2019s skirt as she stood by her sick friend\u2019s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera \u2013 which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients \u2013 to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women\u2019s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims \u2013 females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month. Theft: The nurse stole this\u00a0Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely. 'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.' It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward. Nurse\u00a0Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004. Her mother and the girl\u2019s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol. The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nshe was secretly raped by a male nurse who filmed the attack.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Katie launched an attack on Danny's partner Joanne Mas, saying: 'no\u00a0woman should ever propose to a man,' to which the EastEnders star responded: 'I agree...especially when you look like ya face should be on the side of a gothic building,' and calling her sexist. But a post-graduate English student who proposed to her boyfriend using a personalised pint glass tells FEMAIL that Katie's notions of marriage are outdated. Katy Miller, 24, and Tim O\u2019Brien, 29, who are from Texas but currently live in Portugal, had been dating for several years before she decided to take the plunge last April. She said: 'My partner and I first met at an Irish pub in Texas. 'We both very much enjoy drinking craft beer, visiting breweries, and sampling the local beers in every city (and country) we visit.' She continued: 'I knew he would love it if I tied this common interest into a proposal, so I picked a quiet craft beer pub in a residential area of Dublin to bring things full circle. 'I was a graduate student in Manchester at the time, so Ireland wasn\u2019t very far away. 'I had a pint glass etched with \u2018Tim, after you finish this pint, I\u2019m going to ask you a question\u2026\u2019 on the side, while the bottom that he\u2019d see after downing the pint said \u2018\u2026will you marry me?\u2019 The pint glass that Katy commissioned for her proposal to boyfriend Tim . Tim was delighted with the proposal and immediately said yes, with the pair choosing to elope just a few months later. They said their handwritten vows on a hilltop in a quiet village on the\u00a0island of Mallorca, which Katy describes as, 'One of the happiest moments of our lives.' Katy is proud of her decision to propose to Tim and believes that Ms Hopkins' views on marriage are outdated. She said: 'There are things of real importance women do every day that are cause for actual celebration. 'A woman proposing to a man is not one of them, and I wish it were such an unremarkable event that we never felt the need to discuss it or to defend ourselves. 'Unfortunately, that is not the case, particularly not in the southern US where we are from.' Etched onto the bottom of the pint glass was the question 'Will you marry me?' While Katy and Tim's close friends and family were delighted at their happy news, she does admit that there was a backlash for more small minded people. She reveals: 'People asked if it was an April Fools joke (it was April 16th) and asked me if the proposal was actually for real. 'Acquaintances of my partner had a hard time understanding the concept, and we heard the phrase \u2018real man\u2019 tossed around, as if a \u2018real man\u2019 isn\u2019t any man. 'But the main source of awkward interactions was my lack of an engagement ring.' Katie Hopkins and Danny Dyer got into a Twitter row yesterday after the reality star criticised the actor's girlfriend for proposing to him . Katy believes that in order for us to move into a fully equal society, issues like who proposes to who shouldn't even be a topic of conversation.

'When it comes to relationships, everyone should do what is best for them; however, I refuse to believe that following a man\u2019s lead is what\u2019s best for every single woman.

A fake psychologist was caught running a bogus counselling course after setting her students a series of increasingly bizarre tasks including climbing a tree and riding a bike in the rain. Jacqueline Crane, 52, of of St Austell, Cornwall,\u00a0pretended to be a professor of psychology and claimed she was qualified to train people to become counsellors. She set her students bizarre tasks including scaling trees, cycling in bad weather and taking candlelit baths and would then ask for feedback on how the wacky practices made the students feel, a court was told. But her students - who spent thousands of pounds on her courses - became suspicious because of her increasingly strange ideas and bad spelling. The finally caught her out when a group of her students discovered she had used old exam papers to test them. Crane then invented a fake family and forged doctor notes claiming she was too ill to attend court. Despite her best efforts she was jailed for 18 months at Truro Crown Court after pleading guilty to fraud by making a false representation, perverting the course of justice and benefit fraud. The court heard Crane set up the course in May 2012 and ran it for 18 months, pretending to be a doctor of psychology to con her seven long-term and numerous other short term students out of nearly \u00a38,000. Speaking after the hearing two of her former students have spoken of the damage caused after being hooked by Crane's lies. They said they were reeled in by fake photos of Crane in a university cap on her graduation day. Mother-of-five Jessica Brewster, 35, was one of those sucked in to Crane's fantasy world and spent hundreds of wasted hours trying to improve her future. She said: 'I was a taxi driver for Jacqui and she told me she was going to set up a counselling course, which was something I had always wanted to do. Jessica Brewster (pictured) who was one of the students to be conned by fraudster Jacqueline Crane . 'But from the start there were hints that things weren't what they seemed. 'One of the girls kept pointing out that there were spelling mistakes on these slides and asking where she had got them from. Jacqui didn't like that.' Another of the victims, known only as Jane, said: 'She would set us these exercises. One of them was to ride around on a bike in the rain, which I did on Jess' patio. 'One was to have a candlelit bath. Another was to climb a tree. She asked us to think about how it made us feel.' Ms Brewster said they went on a group outing in Truro where they were set another bizarre task. She said: 'She asked us to go up to random people and start conversations with them. 'It sounds silly but I feel humiliated thinking about it now.' An incident involving fake exam papers finally revealed the truth. The group had got together to go over some past papers and then realised that Crane had just given them one for real. Jane said: 'That's when it all hit home.' Crane has now been jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to fraud at\u00a0Truro Crown Court (pictured) Crane was jailed for 12 months for the fraud against her students and three months each for perverting the course of justice and benefits fraud. They will run consecutively. Judge Simon Carr said: 'The money they had saved up to improve their education has been completely wasted.'

One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended. According to Esa they \u2018give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board Huygens would have heard during one minute of the descent through Titan's atmosphere.\u2019 With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn\u2019t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's \u2018water\u2019 is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe (illustrated) as it descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.

The \u2018music\u2019 was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible.

The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, punched charity worker Glynis Bensley, 47,\u00a0in the head and stamped on her  before stealing her money, phone and jewellery. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in\u00a0September last year. The child robber stood trial alongside Zoheb Majid, 20, from Smethwick, who was found guilty of robbery and manslaughter. A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard\u00a0he left a shoe print on her face (pictured is the scene in\u00a0Smethwick) A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder. Mrs Bensley was on her way home from the Seven Stars when she was knocked to the ground by the schoolboy. CCTV footage revealed that  Majid arrived on his bicycle moments later and the pair turned their victim over, stealing from her pockets. A post-mortem examination of Ms Bensley revealed she died from a severe bleed on the brain. After the attack, the schoolboy fled to nearby Victoria Park to meet up with friends and was heard boasting about the murder and\u00a0selling a gold bracelet. Both robbers claimed they believed the victim was a man because of Ms Bensley's clothing and hairstyle. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year . 'They were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'The brutal attack was captured on CCTV lasting 32 seconds. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis' family at this time and we hope that today's verdict will provide some help in their grieving process.' Ms Bensley's sister Dawn, 55, from Smethwick, said: 'We are a very close and supportive family and always look out for each other. 'To try and explain how Glynis' murder has affected us is very hard to put into words. 'Glynis was my only sister and best friend. I would describe her as my right arm and I thought we would grow old together.' A full statement from the victim's family read: 'We as individuals and collectively as a family have lost a great friend. 'We are unable to express in words the impact that our loss is having on our family. 'Whilst we get on with the day-to-day trivialities of life, the circumstances of Glynis' death remind us all of the important things in life. 'At the time of Glynis' death she was upbeat and looking forward to family holidays and celebrations including her own birthday later that month. 'Glynis spent her life caring for others working in roles for the British Heart Foundation, animal welfare, and was also an active fundraiser for charity's Cancer Research, Mencap and Cystic Fibrosis.

The number of family doctors applying to work in Australia, Canada and other countries where they can earn more for fewer hours has jumped by 40 per cent in just five years. And around 22,400 GPs \u2013 more than half of England\u2019s 40,200 family doctors \u2013 want to retire before the usual age of 60, separate figures show. Lured away: Online ads promises British doctors \u2018more money\u2019 and \u2018great earning potential\u2019 if they leave Britain for Australia (file image) Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the situation as worrying and promised to make \u2018important changes\u2019 to the NHS to ease the pressure on GPs. Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs \u00a3850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered. It follows the Mail\u2019s revelation last week how one practice, in Swinton, South Yorkshire, was making patients wait four weeks for an appointment. Krishna Kasaraneni, a GP at the Crown Street Surgery, told Inside Out that three of its doctors had moved to Australia and Canada since last summer due to \u2018unsustainable daily pressure\u2019. The programme, being broadcast tonight, also obtained figures from the General Medical Council that revealed 792 GPs were given \u2018Certificates of Good Standing\u2019 last year to allow them to practise abroad. This compares to 576 in 2008 and 562 in 2009. Crisis:\u00a0Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs \u00a3850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered (file photo) The NHS is currently advertising in medical magazines in Australia to try to lure back British doctors, promising a \u2018fully funded induction and returner scheme\u2019. On top of the exodus to foreign climes, 56 per cent of GPs \u2018definitely\u2019 or \u2018probably\u2019 expect to leave the profession before their 60th birthday, according to a survey of 1,004 family doctors carried out by Inside Out. Dr David Jones, 46, who formerly practised in Manchester, moved to Perth, Western Australia, over a year ago. He said: \u2018We arrived in November 2013. It\u2019s wonderful here. We do 45 hours a week and weekends are off to enjoy the sunshine. I\u2019m very, very proud of what my colleagues at home do. They do an incredibly difficult job. They get assaulted from all sides. \u2018I do feel guilty to some extent. When a government invests so much money in a profession you are a national asset to that country. But the way that asset is being treated in that country, it\u2019s just pushing people away. It\u2019s reached a point where people are just saying no, I\u2019m not doing this any more. \u2018We shouldn\u2019t be here. Had our profession been looked after as it should have been we wouldn\u2019t think about leaving.\u2019 The website GP Jobs in Australia promises British doctors \u2018more money\u2019 and \u2018great earning potential\u2019. It adds: \u2018Typical earnings start from \u00a3145,000 and rise to \u00a3195,000 per annum after a few years\u2019 experience.\u2019 But it says doctors working in rural locations can earn \u2018considerably more\u2019, adding: \u2018Compared to the NHS, there\u2019s less hassle, less bureaucracy, more medicine and money.\u2019 Younger doctors are not plugging the gaps, with up to one in eight GP training posts unfilled. They are instead choosing the more attractive career paths as hospital specialists or surgeons. The situation has become so dire that 1,063 GPs are needed just to return to the patient-to-doctor ratio of 2009, according to separate figures released by the House of Commons Library. Under the previous Labour government, GPs benefited hugely by a new contract that saw average salaries soar to \u00a3105,000 a year and enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend work. But many doctors now say they are dismayed by the volume of paperwork, the demands of the ageing population and the insufficient funds given to surgeries by the Government. Mr Hunt said yesterday: \u2018What I hope GPs recognise is the things they\u2019ve said to us are worrying them are being addressed. 'They said they didn\u2019t like the targets they have, what are called the QOF targets, and we\u2019ve reduced those by 40 per cent. \u2018They said they needed more money to invest in their premises and we put in this extra money in the Autumn Statement. \u2018These things don\u2019t happen overnight so I would urge people to bear with us while we make these really important changes. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \u2018David Cameron promised to put GPs at the heart of the NHS \u2013 but instead caused a new GP recruitment crisis. It is getting harder and harder to get a GP appointment as a result.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsome surgeries in cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum gps # 850 a day to stand.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Indeed, many may welcome the constant craving by a partner with plenty of stamina. But one woman has revealed the toll her continuous urge to copulate has taken on her life and says managing her condition is a constant juggling act. Scroll down for video . One woman has anonymously confessed that she is addicted to sex and that managing her condition is a constant juggling act . In an anonymous confession to Australia's Gold Coast Bulletin the woman reveals: 'I once had sex with two guys in one night before going to meet up with the guy I was supposed to be seeing at the time. 'This all got a little messy when at one stage I was seeing three men by the same name, in the same week.' Sex addiction is described by the relationship counselling service Relate as any sexual activity that feels out of control. Yet some scientists argue there's no such thing as a clinical addiction to sex and 'sufferers' are simply making excuses for their lack of self-restraint. Russell Brand (left) has admitted to getting treatment for sex addiction and Ulrika Jonsson (right) presented a 2007 Channel 4 show called Am I A Sex Addict? in which she questioned her own romantic behaviour . The woman confesses: 'I'd meet up with men just to have sex. They wouldn't even have to take me to dinner first. You don't want to get too full before a bedroom romp, after all.' Celebrities linked to the controversial condition include Russell Brand, Michael Douglas and Tiger Woods, who are all reported to have sought professional treatment. 'It's not so bad when you're in a monogamous relationship because you always have someone to get your fix with,' the woman writes. 'You don't have to worry about catching anything because of your addiction.' She comments that if she had the time she'd sneak off to the bathrooms to alleviate her urges and says there are little 'key-ring vibrators' that can be used in an emergency. She also mentions the guilt and shame she feels and how men are meant to be the ones obsessed with sex rather than women. Michael Douglas was widely reported to have a sex addiction when he was admitted to rehab in 1990. The Hollywood actor finally admitted the claims in his 2012 biography. American actor David Duchovny admitted to having a sex addiction and checked into rehab for treatment in August 2008. Tiger Woods reportedly checked into a clinic for sex addiction treatment following the breakdown of his marriage in 2009. In his memoir My Booky Wook Russell Brand admitted to suffering from an addiction to heroin and sex, and booked into rehab to treat his addiction to \u2018carnal overindulgences\u2019.

Clinton turned over to a House committee investigating the 2012 . attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, show her aides . sometimes used their personal email accounts to communicate with . her through her own private account. Clinton said during a March 10 press conference that 'the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses.' That, she claimed then, 'meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department' for archiving, where they would turn up in searches conducted in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. But The New York Times reported on Monday that some of the approximately 300 Clinton emails examined by a congressional committee  suggest otherwise. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton could be waving goodbye to her presidential ambitions if 'email-gate' gets deeper. She spoke at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress on Monday . LOST TO HISTORY? Former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Huma Abedin (right) was one of her closest aides, and emailed Clinton in a conversation where both women used personal accounts . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . The emails from Clinton, a presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, do not prove the former . secretary of state ordered a 'stand down,' stopping U.S. forces . from responding to the Benghazi attack or participated in a related cover-up, the newspaper reported,  citing four senior . government officials. But they do raise new questions about how much of Clinton's correspondence has been lost to history. Federal record retention laws are designed to prevent the kind of archive side-stepping Clinton is accused of carrying on for the four years she led the State Department. Congress subpoenaed email records last week from 'close to a dozen' people who worked for Hillary Clinton at State. The Times report is the latest revelation in the saga over . Clinton and her use of a personal email address to conduct . government business, as well as a private computer server to . store that correspondence. PROBLEMS: Clinton has been dogged by allegations that she purposely hid incriminating emails from the State Department \u2013 and from public records requesters \u2013 by keeping all her emails on a private server . Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Times that Clinton's . aides primarily used their work email to correspond with her . about government matters, adding that 'only the tiniest fraction . of the more than 1 million emails they sent or received involved . their personal accounts.' According to the Times, she occasionally exchanged emails with at least four aides via personal accounts while she was . at the State Department, including her foreign policy adviser, . Jake Sullivan; chief of staff, Cheryl Mills; senior adviser, . Philippe Reines; and her personal aide, Huma Abedin. Abedin used an email address on Clinton's private server in addition to her official 'dot-gov' address. Mills reportedly did the same. Clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account, calling it a matter of 'convenience.' In one email exchange cited by the Times, she asked an aide to assess the performance of a top State official before Congress. 'Did we survive the day?' she wrote. 'Survive, yes,' the adviser responded. DAMAGE CONTROL? It's not clear what Clinton's inner circle said to her about her turn before the US Senate \u2013 the infamous 'What difference does it make?' moment \u2013 because the former secretary's emails were outside the State Department's archive system . In separate exchanges weeks later, Sullivan wrote Clinton to reassure her that she wouldn't be held to account in the same way as then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice, who falsely claimed on national television that the death and destruction in Benghazi was the consequence of a protest that spiraled out of control. 'She did make clear our view that this started spontaneously then evolved,' he wrote to Clinton at one point, seeming to reinforce the idea that the Obama administration planned to stick with that assessment.. Later, when the White House began referring to Benghazi as a 'terror attack,' Sullivan told Clinton that in her own publiccomments she had steered clear of the nettles that had snared Rice. 'You never said \u2018spontaneous\u2019 or characterized their motivations,' he wrote, according to the Times. Details on conversations like these are sketchy: The Times wasn't permitted to look at the emails, but relied on descriptions from four different sources. COULD IT BE? Housing secretary Julian Castro (right) has been talked about as a potential presidential candidate and would catch momentum if Hillary Clinton's email scandal derailed her campaign hopes . PROBE: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy chairs a special congressional committee looking into the Benghazi attacks, and has subpoenaed emails from 'close to a dozen' current and past Clinton aides . Cheryl Mills (left) was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department and reportedly used an off-the-books email address to trade messages with the then-secretary of state, potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators . BECAUSE I'M HAPPY? Clinton is her party's presumed presidential front-runner, having come in second to Barack Obama in 2008 . A spokesman for the Republican-controlled House Select . Committee on Benghazi declined to comment, according to the . newspaper. Clinton has said she gave copies of all work-related emails . to the State Department, but Republicans, who see her as their . top target in the run-up to the 2016 election, continued to . press for more records. Last week Republicans asked the State Department to hand . over numerous documents related to Clinton's use of private . email while she was secretary of state and have called on her to . hand over her email server to a third party. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the .

In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom. Police found about 600 pairs of shoes piled high under his bed and he stacked them so high that the windows in the bedroom could not be opened. However, they were shocked when they found over 1000 pairs of runners and slippers stashed away in a 57-year-old man's Melbourne unit . Police have been trying to sort through 40 bags of shoes they collected from the man's house. The shoes range from\u00a0women's\u00a0to men's and even children's shoes. A pair of yellow fluffy Tweety bird slippers stood out, as did a pair of expensive looking runners and some dolphin slippers. While the man has an obvious\u00a0fascination\u00a0with shoes, police believe he does not have mental issues. The Kilsyth thief had been caught on CCTV scouring the area where he lived for the past three months but when he invited police into his home they had no idea as to the extent of his crazy shoe robbing spree . The man has stashed the shoes all over his unit, filling up cupboards with the footwear and forming massive piles in corners of his house . Although there were over 1000 pairs of shoes, the man was reportedly only ever seen wearing one pair of shoes. His only explanation to police was that 'he just liked shoes'. 'They were in his kitchen cupboards, under his sinks, they were in the cupboards above the sink,' Leading Senior Constable Baker told The Age. In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom . Police found about 600 pairs of shoes piled high under his bed and he stacked them so high that the windows in the bedroom could not be opened . 'It really looks like he's just an old man, who is harmless. He's never been in trouble with the police before and he's just got a fascination with shoes.' 'This is just purely someone who likes shoes,' he said. While police are investigating the incident, they have taken a light-hearted approach to the investigation and are holding an open day at the station so the public can reclaim their shoes. 'If you have had shoes stolen in the Kilsyth and Mooroolbark area you are invited to attend the Mooroolbark Police station on Sunday 29 March between 11am-4pm to see if the shoe fits you,' they said. The shoes ranged from women's to men's and even children's shoes. A pair of yellow fluffy Tweety bird slippers stood out, as did a pair of expensive looking runners and some dolphin slippers .

The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, punched charity worker Glynis Bensley, 47,\u00a0in the head and stamped on her  before stealing her money, phone and jewellery. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in\u00a0September last year. The child robber stood trial alongside Zoheb Majid, 20, from Smethwick, who was found guilty of robbery and manslaughter. A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard\u00a0he left a shoe print on her face (pictured is the scene in\u00a0Smethwick) A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder. Mrs Bensley was on her way home from the Seven Stars when she was knocked to the ground by the schoolboy. CCTV footage revealed that  Majid arrived on his bicycle moments later and the pair turned their victim over, stealing from her pockets. A post-mortem examination of Ms Bensley revealed she died from a severe bleed on the brain. After the attack, the schoolboy fled to nearby Victoria Park to meet up with friends and was heard boasting about the murder and\u00a0selling a gold bracelet. Both robbers claimed they believed the victim was a man because of Ms Bensley's clothing and hairstyle. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year . 'They were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'The brutal attack was captured on CCTV lasting 32 seconds. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis' family at this time and we hope that today's verdict will provide some help in their grieving process.' Ms Bensley's sister Dawn, 55, from Smethwick, said: 'We are a very close and supportive family and always look out for each other. 'To try and explain how Glynis' murder has affected us is very hard to put into words. 'Glynis was my only sister and best friend. I would describe her as my right arm and I thought we would grow old together.' A full statement from the victim's family read: 'We as individuals and collectively as a family have lost a great friend. 'We are unable to express in words the impact that our loss is having on our family. 'Whilst we get on with the day-to-day trivialities of life, the circumstances of Glynis' death remind us all of the important things in life. 'At the time of Glynis' death she was upbeat and looking forward to family holidays and celebrations including her own birthday later that month. 'Glynis spent her life caring for others working in roles for the British Heart Foundation, animal welfare, and was also an active fundraiser for charity's Cancer Research, Mencap and Cystic Fibrosis.

'I think City can win a title every year and have a chance - it should and must try to win a title every year.'

Five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City and it could prove more tense and exciting than the Barclays Premier League title race itself. Adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join Europe\u2019s elite next season must swallow an estimated \u00a330million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish . Louis van Gaal said that he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total . \u2018The best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can,\u2019 said Arsenal manager Wenger. \u2018You can see the quality of the teams behind us. Seventy-two points might be enough. \u2018People have finished in the top four with 67 points, but if you look at this year, we have 51 points, so it will be in the 70s. It is a tough run-in, similar to last year.\u2019 Arsenal finished fourth last year with 79 points, well clear of Everton in fifth with 72. It is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years. When Everton came fourth in 2005, they had 61 points ahead of Liverpool in fifth with 58. In each of the past two years, however, the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points. Van Gaal acknowledged Wenger\u2019s years of expertise in the area. \u2018I want to believe him,\u2019 said the Manchester United boss. \u2018It is a rat race. It is going into the last week.\u2019 Arsenal have not given up hope of catching City to finish second, but there is a nine-point gap to Chelsea who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top. Wenger said: \u2018We are nowhere near close to being in the title race. We are too far from Chelsea to say that we are in the title race, but you never know what can happen. \u2018Why should Manchester City give up for the title? They did it before from eight points behind. Without speculating on the weaknesses of any team, we want to be consistent and do as well as we can.\u2019 World Cup winner Mesut Ozil has been in impressive form for Arsenal since returning from injury . ARSENAL . Suffered a Euro wobble but form is strong in the Premier League, winning six of seven since defeat at Southampton on New Year\u2019s Day, after which Wenger switched goalkeepers. Attention is spread over three competitions, although maybe not for long.\u00a0They trail Monaco 1-3 in the Champions League and go to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They are awash with goals, have key players fit and options to make changes, especially up front. Also experienced top-four finishers, with an eye still on catching Manchester City. Top 7 games to play: 3. Prediction: 76pts. Wayne Rooney has returned to an attacking role since Robin van Persie's injury and has performed well there . MANCHESTER UNITED . Results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of Robin van Persie\u2019s injury has moved Wayne Rooney back up front which may prove serendipitous. But they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures, with five of the top seven to play and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle. Away form is poor, with 16 points on the road this season \u2014 the worst in top half barring West Ham. Fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals, but more likely a problem with form so sluggish. Should at least be fresh, having only played 32 games in all competitions. Top 7 games: 5. Prediction: 71pts. Liverpool have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat Manchester City . LIVERPOOL . Finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start. Helped by a settled system, the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Steven Gerrard. They boast the best form in the Premier League since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past. They also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more Europe, but finish with awkward away games at Chelsea and Stoke. No sign of fatigue but Burnley is their 45th game of the season. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 73pts. Morgan Schneiderlin has impressed for Southampton this season as the Saints surprised everyone . SOUTHAMPTON . Scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager Ronald Koeman since the end of January, as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing Champions League qualification and are plotting to stop them. Perhaps this, together with increased expectations, is catching up with them after a brilliant start. Injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which cannot boast the same depth as others pursuing the Champions League. The dream faded during February, a month when Saints scored once in five games, but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 61pts. Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, scoring 24 goals so far in all competitions . TOTTENHAM . In a mini-slump after five without a win in all competitions and bruised by a Europa League exit and Wembley defeat inside three days. Can they be revived and refocused after a gruelling season of 45 games to date? There are 12 more to go, including seven tricky away fixtures. It is a character test for a young team which has key players such as Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Eric Dier completing their first full Premier League campaign. Or will boss Mauricio Pochettino have to go back to those he has cut off, such as Younes Kaboul and Emmanuel Adebayor? Top 7 games: 3.

Indeed, many may welcome the constant craving by a partner with plenty of stamina. But one woman has revealed the toll her continuous urge to copulate has taken on her life and says managing her condition is a constant juggling act. Scroll down for video . One woman has anonymously confessed that she is addicted to sex and that managing her condition is a constant juggling act . In an anonymous confession to Australia's Gold Coast Bulletin the woman reveals: 'I once had sex with two guys in one night before going to meet up with the guy I was supposed to be seeing at the time. 'This all got a little messy when at one stage I was seeing three men by the same name, in the same week.' Sex addiction is described by the relationship counselling service Relate as any sexual activity that feels out of control. Yet some scientists argue there's no such thing as a clinical addiction to sex and 'sufferers' are simply making excuses for their lack of self-restraint. Russell Brand (left) has admitted to getting treatment for sex addiction and Ulrika Jonsson (right) presented a 2007 Channel 4 show called Am I A Sex Addict? in which she questioned her own romantic behaviour . The woman confesses: 'I'd meet up with men just to have sex. They wouldn't even have to take me to dinner first. You don't want to get too full before a bedroom romp, after all.' Celebrities linked to the controversial condition include Russell Brand, Michael Douglas and Tiger Woods, who are all reported to have sought professional treatment. 'It's not so bad when you're in a monogamous relationship because you always have someone to get your fix with,' the woman writes. 'You don't have to worry about catching anything because of your addiction.' She comments that if she had the time she'd sneak off to the bathrooms to alleviate her urges and says there are little 'key-ring vibrators' that can be used in an emergency. She also mentions the guilt and shame she feels and how men are meant to be the ones obsessed with sex rather than women. Michael Douglas was widely reported to have a sex addiction when he was admitted to rehab in 1990. The Hollywood actor finally admitted the claims in his 2012 biography. American actor David Duchovny admitted to having a sex addiction and checked into rehab for treatment in August 2008. Tiger Woods reportedly checked into a clinic for sex addiction treatment following the breakdown of his marriage in 2009. In his memoir My Booky Wook Russell Brand admitted to suffering from an addiction to heroin and sex, and booked into rehab to treat his addiction to \u2018carnal overindulgences\u2019.

Leo Dennis Kozlowski, 68, lives in a small, rented apartment in midtown Manhattan with his third wife, Kimberly, 48, whom he met while he was spending time at Mid-State Correctional Facility in upstate New York. Kozlowski was jailed in 2005 for taking unauthorized bonuses, conspiracy and other charges.\u00a0He was also ordered to pay $167 million in restitution and fines. Former chief executive of Tyco International Dennis Kozlowski and second wife Karen leave New York State Supreme Court in June 2005 soon after he was found guilty of stealing $150 million . Kozlowski, poses with two women in toga costumes in a frame taken from an amateur video tape of the lavish $2.1 million, week-long  party for his second wife Karen's 40th birthday . Last month, he completed his parole after spending three years on work-release. He spent almost seven years behind bars for his white-collar crimes although he faced up to 25 years. During his time in jail, he was separated from other prisoners due to his 'high-profile' status. Although he knows that he did wrong, Kozlowski admitted to The New York Times in a recent interview that he feels plenty more on Wall Street did not pay the price. Kozlowski's fall from grace - known as 'deal-a-day' Dennis, he turned Massachusetts-based Tyco from a small firm into a $150billion force \u00a0- was a gripping case of schadenfreude for the tabloids because of the gaudy life of excess he had led. In the early 2000s, The New York Post published a picture of him under the headline 'Oink Oink' after revelations emerged of his\u00a0$6,000 gold-and-burgundy shower curtain in his lavish, $30million 5th Avenue apartment paid for by Tyco. But as he told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0this week: 'I was piggy. But I\u2019m not that person anymore.' Kozlowski's princely lifestyle was legendary - he owned a multi-million-dollar art collection and had an oceanfront estate in Nantucket and a mansion tucked in an exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. Tyco also paid half of the $2million cost of Kozlowski's second wife, Karen's 40th birthday party in 2001. Held on the island of Sardinia, the bash had a 'Roman orgy' theme and featured an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David urinating Stolichnaya vodka. \u00a0Jimmy Buffet was flown in to perform. Karen Mayo (second left)  poses with a friend and two men in gladiator costumes at her $2million birthday bash - half of which was paid for by Tyco . The Tyco CEO once had a home in this exclusive gated community in Boca Raton, Florida. He also owned a home in Nantucket and on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan . The businessman also owned a 130-foot yacht, Endeavor, which he would sail around the world to compete in regattas. Life now, couldn't be more different. Mr Kozlowski's time behind bars has given him perspective on simple pleasures. He loves spending time with his grandchildren, enjoys subway rides, eating avocados - and even trips to the dentist. He also paid tribute to his third wife Kimberly Fusaro - a divorced Wall Street trader whom he met behind bars after she began writing to him. She began visiting him in 2009 and sending fresh fruit and vegetables from the garden of her Long Island cottage. He proposed to her with a $300 Cubic zirconium ring and they got married last year. He also got a job as part of his parole requirement. He borrowed an office from a friend in Midtown and consults on low-profile\u00a0mergers and acquisitions. He would not discuss his finances with The Times but claimed to have 'no real estate' and a hold a 'minuscule percentage' of the New York Yankees. Fortunately for its  employees, Tyco is still standing, making security systems and employing around 57,000 people.

Beleaguered travellers have been warned that \u2018Easter is cancelled\u2019 as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed. On others they face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. Worst affected will be the West Coast main line, where Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. Scroll down for video . Passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects (file picture) The West Coast mainline, the Great Western and the Greater Anglia line are all planning works on key routes meaning passengers will face hours on rail replacement services or slower routes . The line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will have a four-day shutdown. On Easter Sunday a 55-minute direct trip from Rugby to London Euston will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes, with two trains and two buses. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: \u2018Easter is effectively cancelled \u2013 our line is shut. We\u2019re advising people not to travel. \u2018What makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering. This is unusual.\u2019 Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a  report has found . Other services blighted by engineering works include London Midland, which uses the same West Coast line and has issued a similar warning, and swathes of the Great Western and Greater Anglia lines. Virgin services to Manchester and the North West and Birmingham are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised for disruption from the \u00a3100million works by 14,000 engineering workers, but insisted it was vital. However, the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at Christmas when the key East Coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works, prompting a major inquiry, damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs, and a grovelling apology from rail bosses. Cancellations: The report found that\u00a0when work near King's Cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at Finsbury Park station but 'not enough was done' to manage passenger flow at the new station . Under a large headline on its website, Virgin Trains warns passengers of the impending Easter chaos with the words: \u2018There\u2019s a spanner in the works. Don\u2019t get caught in planned improvement works.\u2019 It said there would not be any trains to or from London Euston, adding: \u2018There won\u2019t be any replacement shuttles either, so finding an alternative train service to London will be very difficult.\u2019 Engineering works on the line between Crewe and Warrington and from Carlisle to Glasgow will \u2018severely reduce services to the North and Scotland\u2019, it said. Services are also likely to be \u2018extra busy the day before and after affected days\u2019 and passengers should book early. West Coast passengers also face major works at Watford Junction from an \u00a381million programme from Network Rail \u2018to improve the ageing infrastructure\u2019. Rail bosses say carrying out works during Christmas and Easter is justified as passenger numbers are down by up to 40 per cent because there are far fewer commuters. But ministers have suggested carrying out such works at times other than at Christmas and Easter \u2013 such as through the summer \u2013 to avoid hitting families travelling during the key holiday periods. Mr Carne said: \u2018We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays to reunite with their friends and families, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period, but there will be disruption for some.\u2019 He insisted that there were \u2018good contingency plans in place\u2019 while the improvements are carried out.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbritain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects. virgin trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. the west coast mainline, the great western and the greater anglia line are all planning works. others face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. beleaguered travellers warned that easter is cancelled as far as trains are concerned.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics\u00a0in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships\u00a0certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper\u2019s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30 . BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES . Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process. The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves. A competitor in the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel plays handball in the mud flats of the River Elbe . A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It\u2019s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than \u20ac250,000. Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 . CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY . Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey\u2019s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you\u2019d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they\u2019re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair.\u00a0VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe wife carrying world championships will be held on july 3 and 4 in sonkaj\u00e4rvi, finland. mailonline travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting sporting escapes. since 1994 couples from the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people. the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe. the annual wife carrying world championships appears to be a fun couple of days.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey\u2019s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you\u2019d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they\u2019re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair.\u00a0VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe wife carrying world championships will be held on july 3 and 4 in sonkaj\u00e4rvi, finland. mailonline travel sheds some light light on the most unique sporting escapes. since 1994 couples from the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people. the countdown is on for all manner of the festivals around the globe. the annual wife carrying world championships appears to be a fun couple of days.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nSure, St Andrews is the home of golf and Monaco hosts the most glamorous race on the Formula One circuit, but the sporting world offers so much more than what can be seen on television. With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics\u00a0in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships\u00a0certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper\u2019s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30 . BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES . Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process. The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves. A competitor in the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel plays handball in the mud flats of the River Elbe . A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It\u2019s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than \u20ac250,000.

This meant a loss of 30 of the regional councils for Francois Hollande's party, which came to power nationally in 2012. Scroll down for video . France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure' Even the Correze department - Mr Hollande's home turf in the south west - was won by the UMP. Former president Mr Sarkozy said: 'Tonight, the Republican right, and the centre, has won the departmental elections.' Referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments.'

Hope is reborn for France,' said Mr Sarkozy. 'The road will be long and hard, but change is coming and nothing can stop it.' Also highlighting the 'failure' of the Socialists, was the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen. Although the FN was expected to win up to one department maximum, they were on course to win more than 200 seats on regional councils. Calling on Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, 'to resign', Ms Le Pen said her anti-immigration and anti-Europe party had a huge part to play in the future of France. Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, conceded 'incontestable' electoral defeat soon after the polls closed at 8pm.

Andressa Urach, 27, had to have toxic substances drained from her body after her bottom fillers 'rotted', triggering a life-threatening infection. The model admitted she brought her health woes on herself after 'my vanity made me push the limits.' Andressa Urach is pictured in hospital this week having life-saving treatment after her buttock implants triggered an infection . The model had to have a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body . Speaking from her hospital bed in Sao Paulo earlier this week, Miss Urach revealed that she has undergone an emergency operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek. Without medical intervention, the infection could have been fatal. She is now recovering after having a a combination of Pmma and hydrogel removed from her body. New pictures have been released of her during and after this unpleasant procedure as she hopes other women will learn from her experience and avoid having surgery in the pursuit of\u00a0perfection. Andressa was first hospitalised last year thanks to cosmetic procedures going wrong . 'I am suffering a lot, but God is with me. It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits,' the mother-of-one admitted earlier this week. Despite making a living off her\u00a0voluminous\u00a0bottom, she said she's now happy to have a less\u00a0curvaceous\u00a0rear if it\u00a0means she can survive. She said: 'Thanks to God I no longer need my body to work, now I work with honour and can sustain my family like that. I prefer to have legs and be able to walk and lose half a buttock than to die.' Of her hospital stay she admitted: 'It's my fault, my vanity made me push the limits' Her voluminous rear used to be her most prized asset but now she said she'd rather it's smaller if it means she'll be healthier . Earlier today, the reality TV posted a picture of herself on Instagram recovering\u00a0in her\u00a0hospital\u00a0bed with her hands making\u00a0a\u00a0heart sign as she thanked fans for their support and get well wishes. 'Small gestures of affection make a difference! In the most difficult moments of our lives, we can see who really are our friends,' she wrote. Prior to her brush with death, Miss Urach - who once made hotly-contested claims that she slept with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - had been an\u00a0advocate\u00a0of cosmetic\u00a0surgery. She had reportedly undergone at least nine cosmetic procedures in the past five years. They were said to have included a nose job, a bioplasty facial 'correction', jaw reduction, breast enlargement, liposuction and even vaginal lip reduction. Most important of all was her prized rear. It won her the runner-up title in the 2012 Miss BumBum contest, which aims to find Brazil's most attractive bottom. She reportedly had injections of two filers, hydrogel and PMMA, to make it larger and more plump. But in July she began complaining of discomfort and had 400ml of hydrogel drained from each of her upper thighs. She told Brazil's R7 website at the time: 'The hydrogel was not absorbed by my body and started to harm me. 'Now I've discovered that the PMMA is sticking to my muscles and causing the tissue to rot. Despite the operation, she continued to be in pain and in November she was taken to the Conceicao Hospital in Porto Alegre with an advanced infection of her left leg. The model pictured earlier this month during an interview with Dailymail.com after her legs were infected . Andressa, a runner up in Brazil's Miss BumBum competition, has revealed the terrible damage wreaked on her body by plastic surgery after wounds in her thigh were infected . She spent a month in intensive care and reportedly feared she would lose her leg . This graphic photos show gaping holes in Andressa's thighs, all in the name of beauty . She underwent two unsuccessful drainage procedures, according to reports, before suffering from septic shock and being moved to intensive care. At one point her life was in danger and it was claimed her leg could have had to be amputated. After making a recovery from that incident, she was then rushed back to hospital last weekend with another infection cause by her buttock implants. She underwent another emergency operation to remove a combination of Pmma and hydrogel and is now being treated with antibiotics through a catheter and will soon begin physiotherapy. Miss Urach hit headlines around the world after claiming she had had an affair with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, a claim the Real Madrid striker strenuously denied. Andressa featured in the Miss BumBum contest in 2012 and claimed she slept with Cristiano Ronaldo . Pain: Miss Urach when her legs began hurting last year (left) and, right, in better spirits in her hospital bed . She said the footballer slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund. The Portuguese winger, 29, took to his Facebook page to say he was 'deeply outraged.' He accused Andressa of 'pure fiction and forgery' and 'seeking the limelight on my account' and insisted he was at the Madrid hotel where she claimed they made love for a media interview. Brazil overtook the U.S. in 2013 to become the most prolific plastic surgery nation in the world. Almost 1.5million procedures were performed in the South American country - an increase of 600,000 in just two years. These included 226,000 breast enlargements and 64,000 buttock augmentations, a fifth of all those in the world. Brazil has more than 5,000 plastic surgeons who also performed 78,000 facelifts, 77,000 nose jobs and 219 penis enlargements, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. But the U.S. was still far ahead for the number of non-surgical procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels, with 2.5million to Brazil's 650,000. Fellow Miss BumBum contestant Jessica Lopes, who shared a flat with Ms Urach, said last year: 'Andressa and I would go to the plastic surgeon as if we were going shopping. 'Sometimes we would agree to do some procedure together, we were not afraid. 'We were slaves to beauty.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nandressa urach, 27, had toxic substances drained from her body. she has undergone an operation to remove the substances from her left butt cheek. the model had to have a combination of pmma and hydrogel removed. andressa urach is pictured in hospital this week having life-saving treatment. andressa urach was hospitalised at the weekend after buttock implants became infected.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

It includes claims that sex parties involving boys below the age of consent were held at the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment block near the Houses of Parliament. The operation includes detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command. It is also examining allegations three young men were murdered, . At 91, Lord Bramall \u2013 the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry \u2013 is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Officers from Operation Midland searched his home last Wednesday. He told the BBC: 'Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated. It is not in my character or my psyche.' He said: 'I know I have only had sex with someone other than my own sex.' He added that any suggestion he was involved in child abuse was 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. He said he had been to events at Dolphin Square 'four or fives times' but only once went into an\u00a0apartment\u00a0there. He has not been arrested, named as a suspect by police or questioned. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer \u2013 and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords \u2013 opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army.

That was the moment when Gareth Bale reminded us why Real Madrid paid \u00a386million for his signature, why the caustic treatment of his recent performances in Spain seems so odd. Having drawn a foul from Eytan Tibi inches outside the box with his pace, he dispatched the ball into the net as simply as if from the penalty spot in any. His shot curled over the wall with surgical placement, leaving goalkeeper Ofir Marciano stock still. It was pure quality. Gareth Bale scored twice as Wales beat Israel in Haifa on Saturday in Euro 2016 qualifying . Bale (second left) lashes in his second goal of the game for Wales against Israel . Bale celebrates as his team moved to the top of Group B with victory in Haifa over Israel . Bale (centre) leads the celebrations after his second half free kick put Wales 2-0 up against rivals Israel . Bale (third right) uploaded a picture to Instagram afterwards with the caption 'what a performance from the lads' Israel (4-3-3):\u00a0Marciano 6; Dgani 5.5, Ben Haim I 5.5, Tibi 3, Ben Harush 6; Yeini 5, Natcho 5, Refaelov 5; Ben Haim II 5 (Biton 60\u2019 5), Zahavi 6 (Sahar 71\u2019 5), Damari 4 (Hemed 44\u2019 5) Booked: Refaelov . Sent off: Tibi . Manager: Eli Guttman 5 . Wales (5-3-1-1): Hennessey 6; Gunter 6, Collins 6, Williams 7, Davies 7, Taylor 7; Ramsey 7.5 (MacDonald 86\u2019), Allen 7, Ledley 6.5 (Vaughan 48\u2019 6); Bale 8; Robson-Kanu 6.5 (Vokes 69\u2019 6.5) Manager: Chris Coleman 7 . Referee: Milorad Mazic 7 . MoM: Bale . His rapturous celebration spoke of the goal\u2019s personal significance and collective importance. He answered his critics without uttering a word and made certain a momentous victory in Welsh ambitions to reach Euro 2016. It was his 15th goal in 49 caps for Wales, moving him level with John Charles in the all-time scorers chart. He went past the great man 13 minutes from the end to rubber stamp Wales\u2019s ascension to top of Group B at the halfway stage on 11 points and within sight of a first major tournament since 1958. Aaron Ramsey provided the assist, seizing possession on the left and cutting back for Bale to finish into the corner. It was goal number 20 for Bale in a season that has been judged underwhelming in Spain. Ramsey deserves praise too, having turned in his best performance in a Welsh shirt for some considerable time, getting the opener eight seconds into first-half injury time that sucked the feverish hostility from the throats of Israel\u2019s fans. It was route one stuff. Wayne Hennessey pumped the ball long and Israel allowed it to bounce. Bale stole above Tibi to nod into the path of Ramsey, who delivered a brilliant header over Marciano. Ramsey celebrated by running to the 900 Wales fans and pointing to the skies, his grandmother having died last week. Bale dedicated the win to much-loved kitman Dai Williams, who passed away last month with the players wearing black armbands. By the end, Wales were running through 10-man Israel at will, Tibi having been sent off for a second booking shortly after 2-0 for fouling Bale again. Substitute Sam Vokes, making his first international appearance in a year following serious injury, nearly scored, as Bale twice went close to getting his hat-trick. Israel are no mugs. Their 3-0 win over Bosnia here in November and perfect record prior to this game, is indication of that. But they were made to look woefully short by Wales. Bale said: \u2018We\u2019re in a good position now and we\u2019ve got a chance of qualifying. We will keep fighting and working hard and hopefully our performances and results will do all the talking. It\u2019s amazing to be top of the table and we go from here.\u2019 Ramsey (right) wheels away in celebration after putting Wales into the lead at the end of the first half .

Bale was at the centre of attention from Israel's defence but still scored his country five minutes into the second half . Chris Coleman was ebullient, and said Bale had responded in perfect fashion to the scathing judgments in Spain. \u2018A plus with international football is when you come away from your clubs, then you are concentrating on something different,\u2019 said the Wales manager. \u2018There's a bit of criticism flying at Gareth in Madrid, but he did tonight what he's been doing for some time with Wales.\u2019 Coleman thinks three wins from five remaining matches will seal qualification.

Referee: Milorad Mazic 7 . MoM: Bale . His rapturous celebration spoke of the goal\u2019s personal significance and collective importance. He answered his critics without uttering a word and made certain a momentous victory in Welsh ambitions to reach Euro 2016. It was his 15th goal in 49 caps for Wales, moving him level with John Charles in the all-time scorers chart. He went past the great man 13 minutes from the end to rubber stamp Wales\u2019s ascension to top of Group B at the halfway stage on 11 points and within sight of a first major tournament since 1958. Aaron Ramsey provided the assist, seizing possession on the left and cutting back for Bale to finish into the corner. It was goal number 20 for Bale in a season that has been judged underwhelming in Spain. Ramsey deserves praise too, having turned in his best performance in a Welsh shirt for some considerable time, getting the opener eight seconds into first-half injury time that sucked the feverish hostility from the throats of Israel\u2019s fans. It was route one stuff. Wayne Hennessey pumped the ball long and Israel allowed it to bounce. Bale stole above Tibi to nod into the path of Ramsey, who delivered a brilliant header over Marciano. Ramsey celebrated by running to the 900 Wales fans and pointing to the skies, his grandmother having died last week. Bale dedicated the win to much-loved kitman Dai Williams, who passed away last month with the players wearing black armbands. By the end, Wales were running through 10-man Israel at will, Tibi having been sent off for a second booking shortly after 2-0 for fouling Bale again. Substitute Sam Vokes, making his first international appearance in a year following serious injury, nearly scored, as Bale twice went close to getting his hat-trick. Israel are no mugs. Their 3-0 win over Bosnia here in November and perfect record prior to this game, is indication of that. But they were made to look woefully short by Wales. Bale said: \u2018We\u2019re in a good position now and we\u2019ve got a chance of qualifying. We will keep fighting and working hard and hopefully our performances and results will do all the talking. It\u2019s amazing to be top of the table and we go from here.\u2019 Ramsey (right) wheels away in celebration after putting Wales into the lead at the end of the first half .

After months of negotiation, the Government failed to secure the crucial agreement to protect customers, as bank bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking. The High street banks have agreed to new industry-wide rules setting out a series of steps they must take before closing branches. Blame it on the internet: As they refuse to commit to never closing 'the last bank in town', bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking . But critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country \u2013 even when there is no other bank in the community. Under the new regime banks will have to consult with local communities before any branch closure and ensure there are alternatives for customers such as free cash machines, \u2018mobile banking vans\u2019, and a local Post Office where they can sort out their finances. Existing rules stipulate that they have to go through this process only if they are closing the last branch in a town or village. Banks also have to give 12 weeks\u2019 notice before they shut a branch. Business secretary Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019. But last night Labour described the rules as another \u2018nail in the coffin for the High street\u2019, as all the major lenders have now ditched a previous commitment always to keep open the \u2018last bank in town\u2019. Vince Cable described the new \u2018protocol\u2019 as a \u2018major step forward\u2019 in ensuring those who do not bank online are \u2018not left behind\u2019 Lloyds became the last to do so in October, as it announced a three year plan to shut 200 branches and open 50. Efforts by Mr Cable to force banks to reinstate this commitment have been rejected and experts have warned that 978 branches around the country are now at risk. In total more than 500 branches are expected to be shut during the course of the year, with 210 closures announced so far. Of these 124 are the last branch in the community. For example, some 8,000 residents of Keynworth in Nottinghamshire have been left without a bank after the closure of their local NatWest branch earlier this year. and St Agnes in Cornwall has also lost its only branch after Barclays put down the shutters for the final time. There are now just over 9000 bank branches across the country, half the number of 25 years ago. Derek French from the Campaign for Community Banking said efforts by the coalition to beef up protection for consumers have failed. He said: . \u2018The government is trying to gloss over the fact that in reality it has achieved nothing and will not prevent hundreds of branches from disappearing from Britain\u2019s high streets. This is hugely damaging for local communities. The hardest hit will be small businesses, the elderly and the vulnerable \u2013 who rely heavily on their local bank\u2019. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: \u2018This is a massive embarrassment for Vince Cable. Local communities sometimes rely on the basic services of a branch and this feels very much like another bail in the coffin for the High Street.\u2019 The bosses of all the major banks have justified the closure of branches by stressing the soaring popularity of digital banking \u2013 both online and on smart phones. They have also argued it is not viable to keep certain branches open because so few customers use them. Royal Bank of Scotland boss Ross McEwan last year described its busiest branch as the 7.01am train from Reading to London Paddington, with over 167,000 using its mobile banking app between 7am and 8am on their commute to work every day. The British Bankers\u2019 Association says internet and mobile banking is now used for transactions worth \u00a36.4 billion a week \u2013 up from \u00a35.8 billion last year. But according to charity Age UK, more than a third of older people have mobility problems making travelling long distances to their nearest branch difficult. Almost 15pc have limited dexterity which means it is hard to use the internet while 4.8 million people aged 65 and over have never been online. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK said: \u2018Accessing cash and paying bills are essential services which must be easily available to everyone. But the combination of bank and building society closures, particularly in rural areas, and the industry\u2019s growing reliance on online services mean access has become increasingly difficult for many older people.\u2019 Vince Cable has said that the Post Office can play a vital role in providing an alternative for bank customers.

'The big boss was there with them. Turkish man say \"put this camera there, change place there\" but John (was) the big boss. 'All time, all time say to all \"fastly, fastly, fastly, we should finish\". So respect him. Only he talks orders - others do.' Saleh said the prisoners would be given Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured that they would not be killed. He said: 'He would say to me \"say to them, no problem, only video, we don't kill you, we want from your government [to] stop attacking Syria. \"We don't have any problem with you; you are only our visitors\".' Saleh said he explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed. His comments explain why so many of the prisoners appear so calm in the executions videos right up to the point where the knife is placed against their throat. A still photo of  Kenji Goto holding a picture of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh. ISIS defector Saleh revealed how hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends . After Mr Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. Appearing with his face covered, the man added Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. He said: 'Maybe because he use the knife. I cannot understand why he is so strong. 'One man can kill and all people will respect. A Syrian man anyone [in ISIS] can kill. But strangers [foreigners], only John.' And hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, with their captors telling them they would not be killed as it was a show for the camera, according to Saleh. Murderer: Jihadi John seen (in black mask) leading the execution of a dozen prisoners. Emwazi was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to defector Saleh . Kuwait-born Emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities, but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several Western hostages. In e-mail exchanges with a journalist, the University of Westminster computer programming graduate said he considered suicide after coming face to face with what he suspected to be a British spy as he attempted to sell a laptop computer in 2010. Jihadi John rose to notoriety after he first appeared in a video posted online last August, in which he appeared to kill American journalist James Foley. Dressed in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose, and a holster under his left arm, he reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. He later featured in a video with Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe man, named only as saleh, said the masked militant who appears in beheading videos. jihadi john was last seen in a video posted online. mohammed emwazi was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives. he also revealed that isis routinely subjected hostages to mock executions. he claimed he witnessed the british graduate dubbed jihadi john behead a japanese hostage.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Now engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms and give them the same ability as the colourful reptile. The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand, by  bending it. Engineers have created artificial \u2018skin\u2019 that could one day be used to make soldiers\u2019 uniforms, giving them the  ability to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon . Researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies, colour-shifting camouflage, and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges and aircraft. \u2018This is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon-like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it,\u2019 said Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain, a member of the University of California Berkeley team that developed the material. They made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair. The markings enabled them to select the range of colours the material would reflect, depending on how it was flexed and bent. Engineers made the material (illustrated) by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair . The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand like a chameleon (stock image), by applying a minimal amount of force . Chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells. The colours we see in paints and fabrics, for example, occur when white broad spectrum light strikes their surfaces. The unique chemical composition of each surface then absorbs various bands, or wavelengths of light. Bands that aren\u2019t absorbed are reflected back, with shorter wavelengths giving objects a blue hue and longer wavelengths appearing redder, with a rainbow of possible combinations in between. While autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make-up, the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light. Professor Chang-Hasnain said that such \u2018structural colour\u2019 is much less common in nature, but is used by some butterflies and beetles to create a an iridescent display. To make the material, the Berkeley team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon, which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility. Rather than spreading the light into a complete rainbow, the ridges reflect a specific wavelength of light. Other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards, active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate\u00a0structural fatigue in bridges, for example. A stock image of Crescent City Connection Bridge in New Orleans is shown . By \u2018tuning\u2019 the spaces between the ridges, Professor Chang-Hasnain said it is possible to select the specific colour to be reflected. They realised it would be possible to subtly shift the spaces between the ridges, and therefore the colour, by flexing or bending the material. As the silicone is bent or flexed, the gaps between the ridges respond . Professor Chang-Hasnain said: \u2018If you have a surface with very precise structures, spaced so they can interact with a specific wavelength of light, you can change its properties and how it interacts with light by changing its dimensions.\u2019 The study, published in the journal Optica, says the material is easy to manufacture with the desired surface properties and is able to reflect very pure colours, reflecting up to 83 per cent of the incoming light. So far the experts have created a piece of material that\u2019s one square centimetre, so more time and research is needed before clothes can be created, for example. Professor Chang-Hasnain said: \u2018The next step is to make this larger-scale and there are facilities already that could do so. \u2018At that point, we hope to be able to find applications in entertainment, security, and monitoring.\u2019 She said the chameleon material to make a new type of billboard as well as create an active camouflage on the exterior of vehicles that would change colour to better match the surrounding environment. It could also be used to make sensors that would change colour to indicate that structural fatigue was stressing critical components on bridges, buildings, or the wings of airplanes. \u2018This is the first time anyone has achieved such a broad range of colour on a one-layer, thin and flexible surface.

To openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible, and good luck finding other blacks who also don't believe. It is very important to note however, that the Internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other, and there is a large community of us online. Though I was raised secular -- a rarity in my community -- I've had to endure ostracism from family and friends as a result of openly identifying as an atheist. However, my journey is far from tragic. In founding my organization, Black Nonbelievers, in 2011, I have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself, or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind. And they have done so bravely, defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion. The Friendly Atheists Next Door . My experience in the secular community as a black atheist has ranged from feeling totally welcome to feeling totally isolated, and even ignored. On the one hand, there is common ground shared -- our nonbelief and even discontent with religion unites us. On the other hand, there is a notion that since we share this common ground that there are no other issues to address. The lack of people of color at secular events is a problem -- partly because there is unawareness of such events existing, but also because there is limited effort placed in accommodation and care. We are sometimes treated as if we are invisible, or even as an afterthought -- which does not make the few persons of color feel welcome. Fortunately, all is not lost. Progress has been made. There are now a number of secular groups that have helped to bring about more diverse representation for people of color, women and children. There is a more concentrated focus on support for the LGBT demographic, as well for others who come from marginalized and disfranchised backgrounds. There are support systems for people who have lost loved ones, yet they have no religious affiliation. Moreover, there is a tremendous amount of literary and artistic talent. Such representation is now reflected at organized events, in leadership, as well as in media coverage. While the number of visible minority atheists is still small, we are here and we're here to stay. We will continue to grow, in both the black and secular communities.

Yes, we exist -- even if many in the media sometimes don't notice us. In a CNN special that aired on Tuesday, for example, people of color were not as well-represented as American atheism's more familiar face: You know, white males. In fact, African-American atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of American atheists at large. Does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just don't gravitate towards nonbelief, or are there other factors which keep us hidden? There is a harsh truth to face here. Most blacks identify as religious. Belief in God is touted with pride, and the church is intricately tied to tradition, history and culture. It is not uncommon to assume that I attend services as a black woman. The question often isn't if I go to church -- it's where. And even if one doesn't go to church, surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god. All of this makes the words \"black\" and \"atheist\" hard for many to imagine in the same sentence. It can be extremely difficult to discuss religion objectively in the black community.

A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women\u2019s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group ...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba\u2019i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I\u2019m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview . The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won\u2019t have time for other questions. 'Now, it\u2019s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: \u201cYou can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her . Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air . Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I). Her first book Tonight I will Confess has received critical acclaim in literary circles and she is now the host for Bidoun Zaal, where she interviews public figures and discusses issues related to society, politics and religion. London-based Sheik Hani Al-Siba'i is Director of London's Al-Maqreze Centre for Historical Studies Hani Sibai.

Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as\u00a0Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her . Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air . Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I). Her first book Tonight I will Confess has received critical acclaim in literary circles and she is now the host for Bidoun Zaal, where she interviews public figures and discusses issues related to society, politics and religion. London-based Sheik Hani Al-Siba'i is Director of London's Al-Maqreze Centre for Historical Studies Hani Sibai. He has previously claimed that \u2018anyone who is not a Muslim is a criminal\u2019 and is seen as a controversial figure who has often made offensive comments in interviews. Speaking to Al-Jazeera TV on July 8, 2005, the Sheik caused great outrage by saying that the London bombings were a victory: \u2018If Al-Qaeda indeed carried out this act [of the bombings], it is a great victory for it. It rubbed the noses of the world's eight most powerful countries in the mud.\u2019 The row comes as global views on women\u2019s rights face more scrutiny than ever before. Last month, a manifesto - reportedly written by an all-women Islamic State militia - advised that nine is a good age to consider marriage for girls, who should have husbands by 16. It also said women must stay behind closed doors, be veiled and only leave the house in exceptional circumstances. While in India, a documentary caused outrage last week in which convicted rapist Mukesh Singh blamed his victim Jyoti Singh for the attack.

Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest. 'We know what's going on up there, but we can't do anything about it. Nobody can help.' The club website advertises the first Wednesday of every month as 'greedy girl day' beginning at midday . The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave. Mrs Jewell added: 'We've made a couple of complaints, but there's no law for sexual activities. It's two years now just wasted.' According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm.

Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest.

The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave.

The victim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic by\u00a0Andrew Hutchinson, 29, as they lay in hospital beds at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. She had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home and showed her images of the attack in February 2012. Sex offenders: Nurses Andrew Hutchinson and Oliver Balicao were able to rape patients at the A&E at John Radcliffe Hospital - where unconscious patients are now being treated in open areas . Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women and Balicao raped another in the A&E department they worked in at\u00a0John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) She told the Daily Mirror: 'I said, \"That\u2019s not me\" but I had my mum round and she said, \"That is you.\" 'I cut my wrists a few weeks afterwards. I knew what I was doing but I think it must have been a cry for help. 'It could have been going on for years and there could be a hell of a lot more victims out there'. The woman, who has children, was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked by the nurse while unconscious. She had today described the fear of having to wait two weeks to discover if she had any sexually transmitted disease, which came back clear. She said she has panic attacks, suffers severe mood swings and has developed a problem with alcohol. Her partner and the father of the children said: 'I want to kill him (Hutchinson). I'm angry and I don't trust anyone these days.' It emerged today that the A&E has now been forced to treat unconscious patients in open areas after two nurses were able to rape patients there in the past decade. In 2010 nurse Oliver Balicao, 42, a married father-of-two, was jailed for nine years after he raped a 17-year-old patient in the A&E and attacked  another in her  bed while working at the same hospital. A senior hospital manager has said that Hutchinson\u2019s crimes has led to a policy change where unconscious patients are now treated in one area with open visibility. But management today refused to explain how two staff in ten years were able to rape women in the hospital - feet away from staff and other patients. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women, and his life of sexual crime was then revealed to police . A court heard yesterday how Hutchinson was 'addicted' to spying on women and children, and filmed his most serious attacks. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman\u2019s skirt as she stood by her sick friend\u2019s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera \u2013 which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients \u2013 to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women\u2019s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims \u2013 females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own - he will be sentenced next month. Theft: The nurse stole this\u00a0Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Mark Power, Director of Workforce at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'The ultimate responsibility for these appalling offences must rest with Andrew Hutchinson. Our staff have been devastated by his actions and his betrayal of their trust. It is not possible to eliminate the risk of a rogue practitioner entirely. 'This does not absolve anybody from learning lessons from these terrible events and we have taken steps to eliminate the possibility of this happening again. Our emergency department is now busier than ever and patients who are unconscious are treated in one area of the department with open visibility. At the time of the offences, this group of patients were more spread out within the department.' It emerged today that it is not the first rape scandal on its A&E ward. Nurse\u00a0Oliver Balicao raped a teenager in a side room after she had been rushed to hospital after an overdose in 2004. Her mother and the girl\u2019s boyfriend did not believe her because she was hallucinating but years later she came forward and he was convicted in 2010. Balicao had even used a condom to hide DNA evidence in the premeditated attack. He was also found guilty of a sexual assault on a 22-year-old PHD student who was attacked in her hospital bed. Balicao was previously jailed in 2007 for 16 months for having sex with a 16-year-old patient in a disabled toilet at the hospital after she had overdosed on paracetamol. The girl had accused him of raping her when luring her in saying she needed to do a urine test - but a jury cleared him of rape and accepted a guilty plea of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nvictim, now 38, was one of two women attacked while under general anaesthetic. she had no idea she had been raped until police arrived at her home. nurses andrew hutchinson and oliver balicao were able to rape patients at the hospital. the woman was sent to hospital after banging her head, only to be attacked. she was secretly raped in a&e by a male nurse who filmed the attack.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations.\u00a0I SUPPORT YOU'. Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said. He told his father 'I think I'm going to live out here forever' but his father said he should finish college first and evaluate his options then.

But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice.\u00a0The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the\u00a0Polytechnic University of Valencia, said:\u00a0'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts. 'These produce a strange flavour or odour, a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration. 'Using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing.' The researchers coated Tronchon cheese (labelled queso Tronchon recubierto) with a combination of\u00a0chitosan, which is extracted from crustacean shells, and essential oils from rosemary and oregano .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nrussian photographer nick lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning video. the multicellular filaments slowly spread across the petri dish before forming mounds and ridges. photographer nick lariontsev has captured mould in a way to out-of-date bread and cheese. he filmed using a specially designed set-up part of the aspergillus genus. he has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Now, a device called the Crow Box could enable bird watchers to make money from their hobby, as well as watch birds develop new skills. The training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. The Crow Box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts, or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids. People who want to train crows can follow the open-source instructions to make their own box (pictured left) which includes a perch and funnel to dispense tasty peanuts (right) Research has shown that crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes. The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. So far, the Brooklyn-based maker of the box has managed to train captive crows to retrieve coins in return for peanuts and hopes that wild crows will learn the same tricks. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. It is powered and run by a laptop that can be placed up to 50ft (15 metres) away. Research has shown that crows (stock image) have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes . An experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren\u2019t just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, which the University of Oxford\u2019s Behavioural Ecology Research Group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The device has a perch, a food tray and a funnel, designed to test a crow\u2019s cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks. There are four steps (illustrated) to training crows to find coins, involving peanut rewards . To begin training, the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine, which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it. The machine is then adapted so that it does the same thing when a crow arrives \u2013 training the bird to wait for its reward by visiting the machine. Once visiting crows have learned patience, the machine is changed again so it only dispenses coins and not peanuts. This part of the training is the highest risk, because it seemingly removes the incentive of nuts. But the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray \u2013 which is fitted with sensors \u2013 and into a funnel, peanuts are revealed and the bird's ingenuity is rewarded. This stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food. The training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food. They may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour, or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure. Gabi Mann, from Seattle, Washington, feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange. The eight-year-old has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads, buttons, pieces of metal, brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions. Perhaps the most touching is a metal fragment with the word 'best' written on it - one half of a pendant that would be completed by the word 'friend' if reunited with the other part. Among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl-coloured heart. 'It's showing me how much they love me,' Gabi told the podcast The BitterSweet Life and the BBC. 'They give me all the special stuff you could ever find. 'We know these are from the crows that sometimes they are rusted and dirty and nothing like what a person would carry around. Sometimes we find them on the bird feeder.' As Gabi throws the food for the birds, crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence. In return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb, earrings, pieces of Lego, rusted screws, polished rocks and glass beads. The open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids. \u2018The more people trying different things the faster we'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows,\u2019 hacker and writer Joshua Klein writes on the Crow Box website. \u2018Once we\u2019ve got the system optimised for teaching coin collection we can move to seeing how flexibly they can learn other tasks, like collecting garbage, sorting through discarded electronics, or maybe even search and rescue.\u2019 The box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows have to use their brains to earn treats. The sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers, a 12 volt power supply, two motors, cables and sensors. Some of the inner workings are shown here . Members of the crow family are known to be among the cleverest of birds, but scientists are finding that they may have intelligence that rivals most mammals and even young children. An experiment by the University of Cambridge showed that crows can perform task that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. The programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. The individual processes are detailed in this diagram . Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat.\u00a0The animal was later released. In another astonishing test set up by BBC Two, a crow called 007 completed an eight stage puzzle in two and a half minutes. It is one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever devised.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ntraining aid can be used to collect coins in return for peanuts. crow box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins. crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old. a device called the crow box could enable bird watchers to make money. the box is similar to a vending machine for birds, but crows are.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year. Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding. But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party. Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer. Rebecca Darnell (right) hanged herself hours after her sister Jo's (second right) wedding . Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.' Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fianc\u00e9 Matt Wilson. 'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk. Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight. Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey. Ms Darnell (right) pictured in the bridesmaid's dress in which she was found dead after her sister's wedding last November . Carlo\u00a0Salamone (pictured with his sister Mirella Newman-Bale, who also gave evidence at today's hearing) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell, his partner of four years, to marry him this summer . She was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a Masters degree in family therapy. 'She was my life partner,' the garage owner said. 'That evening at the wedding I had spoken to Jo's husband and arranged the following summer in Dubai [where the newlyweds lived] to ask Rebecca to marry me. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.' However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.' The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening. Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems. Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist. He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.' She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.' 'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added. Ms Darnell (pictured, third from right) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Jo and her husband Matt Wilson. Family had described her as the 'life and soul of the party' at the event . Earlier last year, Ms Darnell organised her sister's hen party. Family said they could not explain her actions . Mr Salamone's sister Mirella Newman-Bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening, when confided her worries about work and study. The pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things. Rebecca's cousin Samantha Nash, aged 24 years, said she had seen Ms Darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding. Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her. However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011. Records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team, providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems. Her line manager Luke Hedge said Rebecca had been a 'natural giver and supporter of others.' Offering his sympathies to her parents and partner, coroner Richard Travers said Rebecca had been a 'remarkable force.' 'It is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people,' he said. 'I have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work. 'On a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006, which it seems, was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with. 'It is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner, family, work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in Boo's intentions on the day she died. 'On the 8th of November 2013 Boo's sister was married. Boo had played a major role in planning the hen do, which albeit stressful, seems to have gone very well. 'I heard that during the course of the wedding in the main Boo was her usual bubbly, lively self and that she, as her father told me, had been the 'life and soul of the party.' 'It is also right that at other times she had been very emotional. Clearly she did have things on her mind. How much her emotional outbursts were affected by alcohol, I do not know.' He ruled out a verdict of suicide, as he could not find any clear intention, such as leaving a suicide note and Rebecca had made plans to see friends and family for the coming days. 'Consequently I conclude Rebecca died from self-inflicted injuries but her intention was unclear,' he said.

I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.' However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.' The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening. Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems. Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist. He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.' She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.' 'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added.

Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her. However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011.

'It is also right that at other times she had been very emotional. Clearly she did have things on her mind. How much her emotional outbursts were affected by alcohol, I do not know.'

Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year. Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding. But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party. Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer. Rebecca Darnell (right) hanged herself hours after her sister Jo's (second right) wedding . Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.' Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fianc\u00e9 Matt Wilson. 'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk. Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight. Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey. Ms Darnell (right) pictured in the bridesmaid's dress in which she was found dead after her sister's wedding last November .

Competing in the workplace, caring for aging parents and trying teenagers, and busier than ever, we use anything we can to duct-tape our lives and ourselves together: comfort foods, alcohol, energy drinks, and an expanding array of antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, painkillers and amphetamines. All in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace. Welcome to the increasingly altered states of America. Americans are about 5% of the world's population, yet we take half its pills, and 80% of its painkillers.This over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting, according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager, Medco. This is creating a \"new normal,\" bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance. Like steroids in baseball, when everyone starts doing it, the players who don't are at a disadvantage. The overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology, and it's like cosmetic surgery: as more women get breast implants, the rest of us feel flat chested. But the new normal isn't normal at all. Certain antidepressants called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin, the brain chemical that helps regulate mood, which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity, while higher doses can engender apathy. Women are naturally moody. Our moods change, and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient. We are dynamic and responsive to our environment. There is a biological advantage to this sensitivity; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need, what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings. Moodiness -- being sensitive, caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power. It helps to ensure not only our survival, but that of our offspring. Women's emotionality is a sign of health, not disease, and it is our single biggest psychological asset. Yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising. Nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.Steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from \"Should I take an antidepressant?\" to \"Which one should I take?\" These medications can have more far-reaching effects than most people realize, blunting empathy, passion, and sensitivity. SSRIs dampen sexual desire and response, making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners. SSRIs also make it hard to cry, an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong. Tears, and the emotions beneath them, can offer a profound lesson in how people's behavior affects others. We cry when we're touched by the poignancy of humanity, or when we're angry, or frustrated by injustice. And yet, women apologize for their tears, especially in the workplace, where we've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward-momentum, and it makes people uncomfortable. The problem with shutting it down is that we're stifling a piece that we need, that our partners and families need, and that society needs, particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government. The world needs more compassion, sensitivity, intuition and empathy. War, rape, murder, and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence. Change comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong. Sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated. Anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions, from their repression. My patients want to feel better, but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling. The shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women, who, by their biology, are the last and much needed connection to this natural place. As we embrace new technologies, we need to be careful that we don't go too far away from nature and what's natural for us as social primates. We insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners. Why don't we insist on natural moods for ourselves? If we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us, we will be calmer, more at peace and more fulfilled. But we are drowning in artificiality. There is a \"plastic vortex\" of garbage the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean, synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces, virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants. We compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction, because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough. We need a course correction, away from the synthetic, so that we can live lives that honor how we feel. But to do that, we must be able to feel, to be our moody, authentic selves. That is the first step to wellness and to wholeness. Medicating yourself into complacency may leave you unshaken, but it also may leave you unfeeling and apathetic, making it impossible to address the causes of your pain.

The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. \"What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,\" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. \"I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,\" Richel said. \"I didn't hear him say anything,\" she said. \"Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today.\" She said the man came \"within inches\" of whacking her with the machete. \"This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,\" Richel said. \"And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible.\" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. \"Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" she said. \"I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him.\" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. \"What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,\" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. \"The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span ... of this event,\" Normand said. \"Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else.\" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said \"there is a mental illness component\" in their investigation of the suspect. \"No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,\" Normand said. \"And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior.\" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport. Contrary to earlier reports, Normand said Saturday, White was no longer a taxi driver. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nrichard white, 63, died saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds. sheriff newell normand said investigators hadn't been able to talk to white. mayor mitch landrieu says airport is back open and fully operational. the man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport was with a machete and a car containing smoke bombs. white's wife and children had been very cooperative.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Samantha Green, 23, of Woodland made her first court appearance Wednesday. Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig announced the charges against Green who was arrested Saturday in the death of her 20-day-old son Justice Rees. Samantha Green (above in court), whose 20-day-old son was found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child . The charges also include an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her. Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and Green (left) were reported missing . Green, pictured above at court, told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted. Police have said they do not believe her story . 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by\u00a0CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned. Her partner Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fianc\u00e9 [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Her partner Frank Rees (right), who is also Justice's father, is supporting Green (left; right with Rees) Crews looked through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body, which Green said was in the water . Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villase\u00f1or then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough,\u00a0News 10 reported. Villase\u00f1or said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though\u00a0she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. She was then arrested and charged with murder. After her arrest, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto said: 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsamantha green, 23, of woodland made her appearance wednesday. green was arrested in the death of her 20-day-old son justice rees. samantha green, whose 20-day-old son, was found dead near the sacramento river in northern california. charges include an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury. the boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

I thought I'd use the dubious quest for \"The Missing Bourdain\" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film \"The Limey\" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's \"Parts Unknown\" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nmy great-great-grandfather, jean bourdain, was one of them. jean had died in asuncion, paraguay, in paraguay. paraguay is probably best known for a hideout for escaped nazis. paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped escaped nazis.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Around 90 per cent of those attending next Friday\u2019s service to mark the end of the Afghan campaign are either current serving personnel, veterans or family members of those who have died. Afghan hero:\u00a0Corporal Mark Wright was killed in an unmarked minefield in September 2006. His father\u00a0Bob Wright, 68, said: 'He (Tony Blair) is the last person I would want to see' The Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will also attend, along with defence and foreign secretaries from 2001 to 2014, Nato allies and charities. Mr Blair and Mr Brown were invited by the Ministry of Defence. A spokesman for the Stop the War campaign said: \u2018It is obscene that Tony Blair is taking the place of what could be a family member of someone who died in Afghanistan.\u2019 In October 2009 Mr Blair was accused of having \u2018blood on his hands\u2019 as he attended a commemoration service marking the end of the Iraq campaign.

Brittney Ross Brewer, from Windham, Maine, feared she wouldn't make it till her February 27 nuptials, so she officially married Jared Brewer, 31, on Valentine's Day in the chapel at the Maine Medical Center where she was being treated for her aggressive small cell cervical cancer nine months after her diagnosis. But the newlyweds also decided to keep their original wedding date in hopes that Brittney would be able to celebrate with her family and friends one last time - and she did. True love: Brittney Ross Brewer, 28, from Windham, Maine, celebrated her wedding to\u00a0Jared Brewer, 31, during their reception last Friday - nearly a year after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer . Perfect pair: Brittney and Jared shared a kiss at their celebration. Only days later the beautiful bride died surrounded by her loved ones . But just two days after their reception, Brittney died surrounded by her loved ones who had gathered to watch her wedding video with her. 'She still wanted to have a big party to celebrate life and see everybody for probably the last time, unfortunately,' Jared told People of their wedding, which was attended by nearly 200 guests. A photographer captured the couple's entire celebration, including their tender kisses and the moments Brittney spent with her family as she got ready. For her special day, Brittney wore a white gown and cowboy boots, while her bridesmaids surprised her by performing a line dance they had learned. Jared's sister Janessa Brewer shared the sad news of Brittney's passing on Facebook yesterday. Family ties: Janessa Brewer gave her brother and her new sister-in-law a loving look at the reception . Full of fight: The couple officially married on February 14, but kept their original wedding date in hopes that Brittney would be able to celebrate with the nearly 200 guests she had invited to their party . Bittersweet: Jared helped Brittney cut their cake during their wedding celebration . Tender moment: Jared wrapped his arms around his new wife, who wore a white lace dress and cowboy boots to their reception . 'While Brittney may not have won her battle with cancer, she will live on forever within our hearts!' she wrote. 'Jared was able to give her the wedding of her dreams and she enjoyed every minute of it! Brittney was a living, breathing angel... who now has her wings!' Brittney and Jared, who met while working for the Corrections Department in Portland, started dating in April 2012. Jared proposed to her on June 28, 2014, a month after she was diagnosed with cancer. 'The cancer only opened our eyes to how short life can be and how we shouldn\u2019t waste any moments,' Brittney wrote on her blog. 'So we decided not to.' Beautiful bride: Brittney posed for the camera after she checked her makeup before her wedding . Special day: Brittney smiled with her relatives before her wedding celebration last Friday . Unforgettable memories: Brittney shared an emotional moment with one of her relatives who held her hand while she laid on the couch . Surrounded by love: Brittney smiled as her friends and family posed in front of her . She continued: 'He pulled out the most perfect and beautiful ring, asked me to marry him, and I said: \"Yes.\"' They planned on getting married this August in hopes that she would be in remission, but after learning that her cancer had spread to her liver, they brought their wedding date forward to February. Friends and family donated their time and money to assure Brittney and Jared would have as much time together as they could. Even members of the local police and fire departments offered her their sick time so that Brittney could continue to get paid for another year-and-a-half, while one of Jared's co-worker sold t-shirts to help raise them money. Saying I do: Brittney and Jared kissed during their official ceremony\u00a0on Valentine's Day in the chapel at the Maine Medical Center where she was being treated . Normal couple: Brittney and Jared, who started dating in April 2012, enjoyed a night out together after their engagement . Happy times: Brittney shared this selfie on her Facebook page a month before she was diagnosed with cancer . Janessa even created a GoFundMe page to pay for Brittney's medical expenses, which has reached $7,000 of her $10,000 goal. And people continue to donate to the page following the news of her death. After her February 14 wedding ceremony, Brittney shared her gratitude for her family and friends on her blog. 'It\u2019s been such a true blessing these past few days to see my friends and family coming together this past week for me...' she wrote. 'Making sure I got to marry my best friend and spend time with everyone I can.' 'Makes a girl appreciate how truly loved she is,' she added. Unfortunately not everyone wins their battle with cancer... Brittney put up one hell of a fight but this disease was aggressive and rare. The doctors were nothing but exceptional when it came to fighting back... They did everything in their power to stop the progression of her cancer... But God wanted her in the worst way. The disease overpowered her body to the point of fatality. 10 months is all the time the cancer allowed her to have.. These 10 months have had their share of ups and downs but Brittney never let anyone see her pain. She was always the most upbeat and positive person.

Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, is accused of using a phony social media account to kidnap 15-year-old Nichole Cable, of Glenburn, and kill her in May 2013. The Bangor Daily News\u00a0reports that Dube's ex-girlfriend Sarah Mersinger testified Monday that he told her he killed Nichole. Mersinger says Dube covered up Nichole's body with leaves and sticks. During an emotional testimony, she added: 'He told me that he strangled her at the end of her road. He said he put duct tape on her mouth, her eyes and on her hands and feet. Elaborate plot? Kyle Dube, 21, (pictured left in court last week) allegedly abducted Nichole Cable, 15, (right) in 2013 so that he could stage a rescue and be hailed as a hero. His ex-girlfriend has told a court he confessed to killing her and dumping her body in woodland in Bangor, Maine . 'He said he took her clothes off so the police dogs couldn\u2019t smell her.\u00a0He said he covered her with sticks and leaves, so they couldn\u2019t see her from the sky.' The court heard Mersinger would spend 18 or 19 days out of 21 at the house Dube shared with his parents and a four-year-old daughter from another relationship. Mersinger also told the jury that she had met Dube on Facebook, where they began messaging each other. They began dating in November 2012 but her mother didn\u2019t approve . Prosecutors say DNA evidence ties Dube to Nichole's disappearance. His attorneys say someone else killed the high school sophomore. Dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder, arguing that somebody else committed the crimes. During a court hearing last week, it was alleged Dube was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero. According to the prosecution, the bogus account was traced to his home, his DNA was found on a hat at the end of Nichole's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of Nichole's home. Accused: Prosecutors say Dube, pictured with his attorney during a hearing last Monday, left a hat with his DNA on it near Nichole's home . Defense attorney Wendy Hatch said last Monday that the state rushed to judge Dube, and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes. 'We are here to show you the state has holes in their case. They have mistakes, big mistakes,' Hatch told the jury, adding that Dube 'got up the next morning, got dressed, kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work.' Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber said Dube's DNA was also found on Cable's fingernails, and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared. He also said Dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense. 'Dube responded it was what he had done, that they didn't know he had done, that he was worried about,' Macomber said. Horrifying: The court heard Dube (mugshot left) covered Nichole's (right) body in leaves so she couldn't be seen from the sky and took her clothes off so police dogs couldn't smell her . The trial is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names. The case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in Old Town. Nichole's mother, Kristine Wiley, testified that she knew Dube as a friend of her daughter's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance. Between tears, she testified that Dube reached out to her with an offer to baby-sit her other children after Nichole vanished but before her body was found. Wiley said Dube first told her he had heard Wiley said he was responsible for Nichole's disappearance. Wiley said she denied the accusation and that Dube then told her 'if I needed anything, call' and that he would watch her other children for her. She said she never took him up on the offer.

Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, is accused of using a phony social media account to kidnap 15-year-old Nichole Cable, of Glenburn, and kill her in May 2013. The Bangor Daily News\u00a0reports that Dube's ex-girlfriend Sarah Mersinger testified Monday that he told her he killed Nichole. Mersinger says Dube covered up Nichole's body with leaves and sticks. During an emotional testimony, she added: 'He told me that he strangled her at the end of her road. He said he put duct tape on her mouth, her eyes and on her hands and feet. Elaborate plot? Kyle Dube, 21, (pictured left in court last week) allegedly abducted Nichole Cable, 15, (right) in 2013 so that he could stage a rescue and be hailed as a hero. His ex-girlfriend has told a court he confessed to killing her and dumping her body in woodland in Bangor, Maine . 'He said he took her clothes off so the police dogs couldn\u2019t smell her.\u00a0He said he covered her with sticks and leaves, so they couldn\u2019t see her from the sky.' The court heard Mersinger would spend 18 or 19 days out of 21 at the house Dube shared with his parents and a four-year-old daughter from another relationship. Mersinger also told the jury that she had met Dube on Facebook, where they began messaging each other. They began dating in November 2012 but her mother didn\u2019t approve . Prosecutors say DNA evidence ties Dube to Nichole's disappearance. His attorneys say someone else killed the high school sophomore. Dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder, arguing that somebody else committed the crimes. During a court hearing last week, it was alleged Dube was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero. According to the prosecution, the bogus account was traced to his home, his DNA was found on a hat at the end of Nichole's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of Nichole's home. Accused: Prosecutors say Dube, pictured with his attorney during a hearing last Monday, left a hat with his DNA on it near Nichole's home . Defense attorney Wendy Hatch said last Monday that the state rushed to judge Dube, and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes. 'We are here to show you the state has holes in their case. They have mistakes, big mistakes,' Hatch told the jury, adding that Dube 'got up the next morning, got dressed, kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work.' Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber said Dube's DNA was also found on Cable's fingernails, and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared. He also said Dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense. 'Dube responded it was what he had done, that they didn't know he had done, that he was worried about,' Macomber said. Horrifying: The court heard Dube (mugshot left) covered Nichole's (right) body in leaves so she couldn't be seen from the sky and took her clothes off so police dogs couldn't smell her . The trial is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names. The case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in Old Town. Nichole's mother, Kristine Wiley, testified that she knew Dube as a friend of her daughter's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance. Between tears, she testified that Dube reached out to her with an offer to baby-sit her other children after Nichole vanished but before her body was found. Wiley said Dube first told her he had heard Wiley said he was responsible for Nichole's disappearance. Wiley said she denied the accusation and that Dube then told her 'if I needed anything, call' and that he would watch her other children for her. She said she never took him up on the offer.

But six months later, the three-time Olympic gold medalist's office at the Misty May-Treanor Sports Center is empty after a mysterious fallout with her longtime trainer Mike Rangel, who founded the Irvine facility. Now parents are threatening to stop paying their  seasonal dues of $4,300 because their children aren't getting the benefit of May-Treanor's tutelage, as they feel they were promised. Scroll down for video . Olympic gold-medalist Misty May-Treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer Mike Rangel, just six months after he founded a new sports center in her name . Brand new: The 155,000-square-foot Misty May-Treanor Sports Center was opened in November 2014. Parents pay $4,300 to let their children play at the facility for a seven-month season . Boycotts: Some parents at the facility have threatened to stop paying their dues because May-Treanor has not been involved at the facility recently . In a new report by the OC Register, Rangel said he and May-Treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship. Rangel agreed to let Asics sponsor the club, while 37-year-old May-Treanor remains a spokesman for competitor Nike. 'I can respect the fact that she doesn\u2019t want to be photographed with 500 girls that are wearing Asics gear,' Rangel said. However, rumors abound in the club about a deeper-seeded issue that caused May-Treanor's distance, and the scrubbing of all her photos from the club's website. Cary Lambeth, a longtime youth basketball organizer who helped in the early planning stages of the MMTSC believes the break is 'because their visions were not the same'. 'I do not think Misty was doing it for Misty. I think Misty was doing it because she wanted to give back,' Lambeth said. Daily Mail Online reached out to May-Treanor's agent for comment on Tuesday, but did not immediately get a reply. Calls to Mike Rangel were also not returned. May-Treanor's apparent rift with Rangel is surprising considering their previously close relationship. In her 2010 autobiography, she described her relationship with Rangel as 'one of the most important partnerships' in her volleyball career. Rangel helped train May-Treanor between 2002 and 2012, during which she won three gold medals in the Olympics for beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. The split was also swift. May-Treanor attended coaches meetings for the new facility in August, and even gave excited interviews about the club in October. But since then it's been radio silence. Checked out: May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the MMTSC since October. The sports legend pictured on the left with a Laguna Hills High School senior at the facility on October 2 . Legend: It's still unclear what caused the rift between May-Treanor and her longtime trainer Rangel. Rangel trained May-Treanor for 12 years, during which she won three Olympic gold medals in beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. May-Treanor pictured above compting in the London Olympic games . Erased: The club's website now shows now sign of Misty May-Treanor's name or image on the homepage . In October, May-Treanor told the OC Register that the building of the sports center was close to her heart, since she grew up in the area and knew there weren't many places for local kids to play. 'Growing up as a volleyball player around here, I know how gym space had become more and more limited,' May-Treanor said. 'This is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports, too. With the amount of sports and teams we have here, it\u2019s important to have a facility like this.' Brand minded? Rangel says the split with May-Treanor stems from a sponsorship issue. Asics is sponsoring the club, while May-Treanor remains a spokesman for Nike. May-Treanor and Jennings pictured above celebrating their gold medal win at the London games . She also appeared to be interested in interacting with the youth teams that trained at the center. 'I love the coaching and teaching aspect of what we\u2019ll be doing,' May-Treanor said. 'That\u2019s the big part for me, the sharing of information with younger players. And the beauty of this is that I don\u2019t have to be dedicated to one team.' May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the gym since October, a month before it's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office. Last month, about 60 parents with kids at the gym met in a nearby park to discuss action. And in a meeting with Rangel, volleyball mom Michelle Peters threatened to stop paying, saying she felt her 15-year-old daughter wasn't getting the advertised program (parents at the facility pay $4,300 for a seven-month season). 'What aren\u2019t you getting?' Rangel asked during the meeting. 'Well, we\u2019re not getting Misty May,' Peters responded. Rangel says most of the malcontent parents came from a club in Mission Viejo and were not happy when their former club director, who moved to work at the MMTSC, resigned over clashes with him. The 155,000-square-foot facility was pitched to May-Treanor by Rangel ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. Rangel wanted to built a state-of-the-art sports facility, while May-Treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair.

Scroll down for video . Olympic gold-medalist Misty May-Treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer Mike Rangel, just six months after he founded a new sports center in her name . Brand new: The 155,000-square-foot Misty May-Treanor Sports Center was opened in November 2014. Parents pay $4,300 to let their children play at the facility for a seven-month season . Boycotts: Some parents at the facility have threatened to stop paying their dues because May-Treanor has not been involved at the facility recently . In a new report by the OC Register, Rangel said he and May-Treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship. Rangel agreed to let Asics sponsor the club, while 37-year-old May-Treanor remains a spokesman for competitor Nike. 'I can respect the fact that she doesn\u2019t want to be photographed with 500 girls that are wearing Asics gear,' Rangel said. However, rumors abound in the club about a deeper-seeded issue that caused May-Treanor's distance, and the scrubbing of all her photos from the club's website. Cary Lambeth, a longtime youth basketball organizer who helped in the early planning stages of the MMTSC believes the break is 'because their visions were not the same'. 'I do not think Misty was doing it for Misty. I think Misty was doing it because she wanted to give back,' Lambeth said. Daily Mail Online reached out to May-Treanor's agent for comment on Tuesday, but did not immediately get a reply. Calls to Mike Rangel were also not returned. May-Treanor's apparent rift with Rangel is surprising considering their previously close relationship. In her 2010 autobiography, she described her relationship with Rangel as 'one of the most important partnerships' in her volleyball career. Rangel helped train May-Treanor between 2002 and 2012, during which she won three gold medals in the Olympics for beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. The split was also swift. May-Treanor attended coaches meetings for the new facility in August, and even gave excited interviews about the club in October. But since then it's been radio silence. Checked out: May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the MMTSC since October. The sports legend pictured on the left with a Laguna Hills High School senior at the facility on October 2 .

May-Treanor pictured above compting in the London Olympic games . Erased: The club's website now shows now sign of Misty May-Treanor's name or image on the homepage . In October, May-Treanor told the OC Register that the building of the sports center was close to her heart, since she grew up in the area and knew there weren't many places for local kids to play. 'Growing up as a volleyball player around here, I know how gym space had become more and more limited,' May-Treanor said. 'This is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports, too. With the amount of sports and teams we have here, it\u2019s important to have a facility like this.' Brand minded? Rangel says the split with May-Treanor stems from a sponsorship issue. Asics is sponsoring the club, while May-Treanor remains a spokesman for Nike. May-Treanor and Jennings pictured above celebrating their gold medal win at the London games . She also appeared to be interested in interacting with the youth teams that trained at the center. 'I love the coaching and teaching aspect of what we\u2019ll be doing,' May-Treanor said. 'That\u2019s the big part for me, the sharing of information with younger players. And the beauty of this is that I don\u2019t have to be dedicated to one team.' May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the gym since October, a month before it's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office. Last month, about 60 parents with kids at the gym met in a nearby park to discuss action. And in a meeting with Rangel, volleyball mom Michelle Peters threatened to stop paying, saying she felt her 15-year-old daughter wasn't getting the advertised program (parents at the facility pay $4,300 for a seven-month season). 'What aren\u2019t you getting?' Rangel asked during the meeting. 'Well, we\u2019re not getting Misty May,' Peters responded. Rangel says most of the malcontent parents came from a club in Mission Viejo and were not happy when their former club director, who moved to work at the MMTSC, resigned over clashes with him. The 155,000-square-foot facility was pitched to May-Treanor by Rangel ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. Rangel wanted to built a state-of-the-art sports facility, while May-Treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair.

The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ndraft legislation aimed at flagging birth rate threatens to reduce iranian women. the london-based human rights group said a first bill would restrict access to contraception. iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065. second draft law is to go before parliament next month.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.\u2019 Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: \u2018No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.\u2019 Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were \u2018oppressive\u2019. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: \u2018These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays . The trays of chicken are then distributed to KFC branches nationwide and sold to customers . This is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . \u2018Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. \u2018These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter. A great number suffer broken bones during this process.\u2019 A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers \u2018an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK\u2019s most recognisable businesses\u2019. It is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. A KFC spokesman said: \u2018Animal welfare is essential for high quality food and is important to our customers, and all of KFC\u2019s suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements. KFC was the first quick-service restaurant to gain Red Tractor certification and we have in place our own robust standard, which is independently audited by third parties.\u2019 Episode one of The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop airs on BBC1 at 9pm.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbut now conditions on the farms that supply kfc can be shown for the first time. images show tens of thousands of chickens kept together in huge sheds, alive. the farmer in charge claims it's 'a very good life' the thousands of chickens live together in just 35 days before they are gassed. supplier andrew in the shed filled with 34,00 chickens destined for kfc.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Detectives are hunting for the attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl last Friday. Officers described the footage as 'harrowing', but released it in an effort to identify the attacker, who struck at a bus stop on the outskirts of Leeds in the Beeston area of the city. The attacker drags the young 18-year-old girl from the bus stop into the front garden to begin his attack . The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to \u00a0pummel her with a large stone . The attacker, is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and is in his early 20s, with receding black hair. He is of slim build. The footage shows the man drag the girl onto an area of grass behind the busy bus stop. Detectives believe that several motorists passed the scene during the attack and fear that the man will strike again if not caught. Officers said the man hit the defenceless girl with a large stone to subdue her before subjecting her to a serious sexual assault. The unidentified man then left his victim for dead. Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.' He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties. If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.' At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot . Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari . The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week . The detective described the footage calling it 'harrowing in nature', but said police hoped its release may jog the memories of anyone in the area when the attack happened at 11.50pm last Friday. 'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop. It is absolutely appalling', he said. 'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead. 'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road. 'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless. 'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released. 'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his earlies twenties, slim, with receding black hair.

A fake psychologist was caught running a bogus counselling course after setting her students a series of increasingly bizarre tasks including climbing a tree and riding a bike in the rain. Jacqueline Crane, 52, of of St Austell, Cornwall,\u00a0pretended to be a professor of psychology and claimed she was qualified to train people to become counsellors. She set her students bizarre tasks including scaling trees, cycling in bad weather and taking candlelit baths and would then ask for feedback on how the wacky practices made the students feel, a court was told. But her students - who spent thousands of pounds on her courses - became suspicious because of her increasingly strange ideas and bad spelling. The finally caught her out when a group of her students discovered she had used old exam papers to test them. Crane then invented a fake family and forged doctor notes claiming she was too ill to attend court. Despite her best efforts she was jailed for 18 months at Truro Crown Court after pleading guilty to fraud by making a false representation, perverting the course of justice and benefit fraud. The court heard Crane set up the course in May 2012 and ran it for 18 months, pretending to be a doctor of psychology to con her seven long-term and numerous other short term students out of nearly \u00a38,000. Speaking after the hearing two of her former students have spoken of the damage caused after being hooked by Crane's lies. They said they were reeled in by fake photos of Crane in a university cap on her graduation day. Mother-of-five Jessica Brewster, 35, was one of those sucked in to Crane's fantasy world and spent hundreds of wasted hours trying to improve her future. She said: 'I was a taxi driver for Jacqui and she told me she was going to set up a counselling course, which was something I had always wanted to do. Jessica Brewster (pictured) who was one of the students to be conned by fraudster Jacqueline Crane . 'But from the start there were hints that things weren't what they seemed. 'One of the girls kept pointing out that there were spelling mistakes on these slides and asking where she had got them from. Jacqui didn't like that.' Another of the victims, known only as Jane, said: 'She would set us these exercises. One of them was to ride around on a bike in the rain, which I did on Jess' patio. 'One was to have a candlelit bath. Another was to climb a tree. She asked us to think about how it made us feel.' Ms Brewster said they went on a group outing in Truro where they were set another bizarre task. She said: 'She asked us to go up to random people and start conversations with them. 'It sounds silly but I feel humiliated thinking about it now.' An incident involving fake exam papers finally revealed the truth. The group had got together to go over some past papers and then realised that Crane had just given them one for real. Jane said: 'That's when it all hit home.' Crane has now been jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to fraud at\u00a0Truro Crown Court (pictured) Crane was jailed for 12 months for the fraud against her students and three months each for perverting the course of justice and benefits fraud. They will run consecutively. Judge Simon Carr said: 'The money they had saved up to improve their education has been completely wasted.' Jeremy Leaning, defending, said Crane had admitted being a fantasist since childhood and that she accepted responsibility for the offending.

The singer has gone on to release four more albums, which have all gone to to the top spot in America . But it wasn't until last year that the 25 year old from\u00a0Pennsylvania went on to become a global superstar on a level with the likes of Beyonce or Adele. Scroll down for video .

Taylor's influence is now mind blowing - she has\u00a052.8 million Twitter followers and\u00a074.4 million likes on Facebook. Last year, Shake It Off went to No.1 on the iTunes chart in 64 different countries and in January, she sold the four millionth copy of 1989 in the US alone. The new success had coincided with a new Taylor - one who had cut off her long blonde hair into a sophisticated bob, moved to New York and developed a close-knit group of female friends who she frequently hosts dinner parties for at her Tribeca apartment. Perhaps most crucially though, 2014 also marked the year that Taylor Swift was a singleton. Taylor with with the supermodel Cara Delevingne . Taylor with the singer Lorde (left) and Ellie Goulding (right) Since she was 16, Taylor has had a slew of celebrity boyfriends that have all ended in heartbreak. It would be hard not to be aware of her failed romances, given the coverage they have received both in her music and in the news. In her teens, she dated heartthrobs Taylor Lautner and Joe Jonas, before moving on to the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer. There was a brief romance with Conor Kennedy before what has now become her most famous relationship - Harry Styles. Taylor Swift with ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas, who she dated in 2008 . Taylor Swift with Taylor Lautner, who she dated in 2009 . But her dalliance with the One Direction star was enough to put Taylor off men and since her break-up with the singer in January 2013, she has focused on living a single life. She told The Telegraph on Saturday: 'The thing about my girlfriends right now is that none of them needs me for anything other than friendship - I love the fact that they are all passionate about their jobs, whatever their jobs are.' 'I used to think it was important to find a boyfriend, but I don't feel that it is now.' In doing this, the tide has turned for Taylor in terms of public opinion - up until last year, many derided the star for being boy crazy and acting like a crazed bunny boiler. The reputation for being a man hunter also unfairly affected people's opinions about her professional success, which has been almost unprecedented for a singer/songwriter of her age. Taylor with Jake Gyllenhaal (left), who she dated in 2010 and Conor Kennedy, who she dated in 2012 . Taylor with Harry Styles in December 2012 in New York . But with 1989, a new Taylor emerged - the songs were no longer about men and more about her relationships with her peers and the public. Shake It Off was a brilliant two fingers up to the 'haters' who had been criticising her for so long simply for having boyfriends. Taylor's move to New York from Nashville also coincided with a chic new style. For the last 12 months, the star has consistently been photographed on the world's best dressed lists and she even holds her own when out partying with her gaggle of supermodel friends like Karlie Kloss.

Every morning, she leaves her Manhattan loft dressed in an immaculate ensemble that puts most celebrities to shame. Stick her name into Google and it is virtually impossible to find a snap of Taylor with a hair out of place. And while her schedule has become even more demanding, she hasn't failed to forget the people who helped her to make it in the first place. Taylor with Karlie at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in London last December . Ellie Goulding and Lewis Hamilton present Taylor Swift with the award for International Female at last month's BRIT Awards . Her feelings of responsibility towards her fans is one of the strongest in showbiz - she researches their hobbies on social media and then buys presents for them that reflect their personalities. According to the Telegraph, she has even been known to help pay off her supporters' student loans. She said: 'Do they like photography? I'll get them an 1980s Polaroid camera. Do they like vintage stuff? I'll go to an antiques place and get them 1920s earrings. Do they work out a lot? I'll get them workout stuff. 'When you actually get to know them on a person-by-person basis, you realise what you're doing is special and sacred and it matters.' With an attitude like that, her popularity is unlikely to fade anytime soon.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ntaylor swift has been a star since she released her first album. the 25 year old from pennsylvania went on a level with the likes of beyonce or adele. the singer has gone on to release four more albums. taylor has focused on her close-knit group of girl friends. taylor's influence is mind blowing - she has 52.8 million twitter followers.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to McLaren in the early years and then moving to Mercedes for the 2013 season, despite the aristocracy of British motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team. The importance of making the correct decision was reinforced on the podium after Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, when he saw Sebastian Vettel on the top step after the German\u2019s own successful move from Red Bull to Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton sits on the podium alongside Sebastian Vettel after he claimed his first victory for Ferrari . Hamilton, out of contract at the end of the season, says his new Mercedes deal will be completed this week . Hamilton, who finished second, also thought of Fernando Alonso, whose career management has been disastrous since he left Renault in 2005, the year he won the last of his two world titles. The Spaniard then walked out on McLaren when he could have won a third championship, went back to Renault as a stop-gap, joined Ferrari while it was moribund and returned to McLaren this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners Honda. Alonso managed less than half of Sunday\u2019s race before a cooling problem intervened. Vettel, in only his second race for Ferrari, won in the car Alonso had just vacated. \u2018It\u2019s nice to see Ferrari back up,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I sat next to Sebastian and thought to myself, \u201cWhat is Fernando thinking?\u201d I remember when I left McLaren and came here, we were better the next year. I had a good feeling then, but he\u2019s almost done the opposite of what I did. It could have been him today. It\u2019s just strange how things turn out. Hamilton finished behind race-winner Vettel in Sepang but still remains in the lead of the world championship . Hamilton led Vettel off the start-line at the Malaysian Grand Prix but eventually lost out to the German . \u2018McLaren are a fantastic team. It looks bad now but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get it together. Before you know it, it will be the three of us fighting, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u2019 Alonso\u2019s predicament is a terrible shame because he was the heir who supplanted Michael Schumacher as the German approached his first retirement in 2009. Hamilton, 30, does not want to fall into the same trap, and says he is ready to sign a new contract with Mercedes for three more years beyond this season. The tantalising prospect of his joining Ferrari, where he is hugely admired by president Sergio Marchionne, seems remote. They have Vettel and Hamilton is already part of a top team. No matter Sunday\u2019s result \u2014 Hamilton beaten on pure pace by Vettel\u2019s Ferrari \u2014 Mercedes are the team of the moment. Asked about signing for Ferrari, Hamilton said: \u2018No, don\u2019t be silly. My contract at Mercedes should be done this week. There\u2019s no reason why not. Honestly, it\u2019s 99.6 per cent done.\u2019 Hamilton is expected to earn more than his current annual \u00a320million salary when he pens his new deal . The exact terms of drivers\u2019 contracts are kept secret, but it is thought that Hamilton will get more than his current annual \u00a320million salary, though probably not match Vettel\u2019s deal at Ferrari, which could be worth up to \u00a335m if he collects all his bonuses and extras. The Mercedes board want their team to be cost-efficient and will not pay the Earth even for a driver of Hamilton\u2019s talent. As well as tying up the contract, Mercedes will spend the fortnight before the next race in China responding to the Ferrari challenge. It is believed that the cooler temperatures expected in Shanghai will favour Mercedes, but at least their defeat after eight successive wins relieved the monotony. \u2018I don\u2019t think Ferrari\u2019s win is a one-off,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I don\u2019t think they were lucky or it was a fluke. There\u2019s always talk that they are easier on their tyres. \u2018I think we\u2019ll manage. We\u2019ve got a great group of people, a great approach, and from this we\u2019ll take a step back. \u2018Second for me and third for Nico (Rosberg) is still good but they\u2019re too close to us in the championship, so we\u2019ll work very hard to analyse. It was not a kick; it was a pinch. We have now got a race on our hands.\u2019 That is good news for the sport and hope for all the teams.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career. sebastian vettel is on the podium after sunday's malaysian grand prix. hamilton says his new mercedes deal will be completed this week. lewis hamilton claimed his first victory for ferrari. hamilton finished behind race-winner vettel in sepang.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

'We have a glorious view all the way to the Butt of Lewis but the eclipse has helped put Aird Uig on the map. It will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists. But it is a long way to come on the off chance. Aird Uig is a village on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Aird Uig is within the parish of Uig. Known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape. Aird Uig is mainly a former Cold War camp, high above sea level, used by the RAF to man a vital communications post. The giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting Aird Uig listed as an official dark skies spot. Richard Leparoux, who runs the small four star hotel Auberge at Carnish in Uig, said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from England - paying \u00a3135-a-night. 'I think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse,' he said. Pupils at Uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons. 'Many of our members have opened up in March especially for the eclipse,' he said. 'We have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok. Cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse. We are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost. 'People coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like Cornwall where people just hopped in a car. 'We have the best view in the UK and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them.' A spokesman for the Western Isles Council added: 'It is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not, in this case.' Aird Uig is a vital communications post, but residents want a community buyout of the military land . The moon will travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth and darkening the skies across Scotland and across Europe in the morning of Friday (20 March). It is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight. The partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will start around 8.30am and will last until about 10.45am. The further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland\u00a0is the place to be on this list . Dr Steve Bell, head of the HM Nautical Almanac Office said: 'The path of totality lies well to the northwest of the UK making landfall over the Faroe Islands and Svalbard as totality moves towards the North Pole. 'The UK will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse. 'The place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the UK is the west coast of the Isle of Lewis close to Aird Uig. 'Here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am. 'Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands.' Stornoway Astronomical Society are staging a special observing session at the 5,000 year old Callanish Stones - thought to have been an ancient observatory. Society president Donny Mackay said it had received a deluge of inquiries about the eclipse and were expecting a large number of visitors. 'The Isle of Lewis is the best location in the UK for viewing the eclipse - marginally better than in Shetland and the Orkney isles. We are hoping the weather will be in our favour on the day,' he said. A team from BBC Breakfast will be broadcasting live from Callanish too. David Warrington, resident astronomer at the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory added: 'It will suddenly get dark for half an hour or so with an eerie false dawn. 'From the Borders upwards you should get this noticeable darkening and the further north you travel the darker it will appear to be as more of the sun will disappear behind the moon.' Birds can be fooled by the sudden darkness and are likely to fly off to find refuge. Experts warned people not to look at the sun for too long and use eclipse glasses or a pinhole viewer.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe only b&b in the area still has a room available for the spectacle. the west side of lewis is best place in the country to view the event. friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular show of its kind 16 years. the tiny and remote hamlet of aird uig on the isle's west coast has been named as the best place. visitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on friday.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Aird Uig is mainly a former Cold War camp, high above sea level, used by the RAF to man a vital communications post. The giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting Aird Uig listed as an official dark skies spot. Richard Leparoux, who runs the small four star hotel Auberge at Carnish in Uig, said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from England - paying \u00a3135-a-night. 'I think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse,' he said. Pupils at Uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons. 'Many of our members have opened up in March especially for the eclipse,' he said. 'We have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok. Cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse. We are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost. 'People coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like Cornwall where people just hopped in a car. 'We have the best view in the UK and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them.' A spokesman for the Western Isles Council added: 'It is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not, in this case.' Aird Uig is a vital communications post, but residents want a community buyout of the military land . The moon will travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth and darkening the skies across Scotland and across Europe in the morning of Friday (20 March). It is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight. The partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will start around 8.30am and will last until about 10.45am. The further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland\u00a0is the place to be on this list . Dr Steve Bell, head of the HM Nautical Almanac Office said: 'The path of totality lies well to the northwest of the UK making landfall over the Faroe Islands and Svalbard as totality moves towards the North Pole. 'The UK will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse. 'The place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the UK is the west coast of the Isle of Lewis close to Aird Uig. 'Here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am. 'Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands.' Stornoway Astronomical Society are staging a special observing session at the 5,000 year old Callanish Stones - thought to have been an ancient observatory. Society president Donny Mackay said it had received a deluge of inquiries about the eclipse and were expecting a large number of visitors. 'The Isle of Lewis is the best location in the UK for viewing the eclipse - marginally better than in Shetland and the Orkney isles. We are hoping the weather will be in our favour on the day,' he said. A team from BBC Breakfast will be broadcasting live from Callanish too. David Warrington, resident astronomer at the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory added: 'It will suddenly get dark for half an hour or so with an eerie false dawn. 'From the Borders upwards you should get this noticeable darkening and the further north you travel the darker it will appear to be as more of the sun will disappear behind the moon.' Birds can be fooled by the sudden darkness and are likely to fly off to find refuge. Experts warned people not to look at the sun for too long and use eclipse glasses or a pinhole viewer.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe only b&b in the area still has a room available for the spectacle. the west side of lewis is best place in the country to view the event. friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular show of its kind 16 years. the tiny and remote hamlet of aird uig on the isle's west coast has been named as the best place. visitors to the isle of lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The city, which sits in Tornado Alley and sees a large number of the tower's namesake weather events, has been looking for a building to rejuvenate an area that currently holds a part-time garage. Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc, an architecture firm based in Tulsa, was approached by a local magazine to come up with an idea, and has now unveiled the concept for the Tornado Tower, which would hold a severe weather museum and research center. Scroll down for video . Architecture firm Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc have designed a building for downtown Tulsa called the Tornado Tower . Architect Andrew Kinslow told Daily Mail Online that the plan 'has kind of taken on a life of its own' after it was released late last month. Plans for the funnel cloud-shaped tower currently range from 20 to 30 stories, and would multiple floors would feature outdoor terraces. Mr Kinslow said that the garden floors were designed to look like tree debris being carried away by the twister. The building's similarities to its real-life counterpart also include LED lights on the outside that would be spaced to give drivers on a nearby highway the illusion that the structure was spinning. A restaurant on the top floor would also spin counter-clockwise, the direction of tornadoes. Mr Kinslow said that they have been contacted by multiple potential investors interested in finding out more details about the project. The firm says that the reaction has been largely positive and that two Tulsa City Councillors have already voiced support. The funnel cloud building would hold a weather museum, multiples gardens, a revolving restaurant and a research center . While the design of the building may make it look likely to be blown over in the famously strong Oklahoma winds, its creators say the structure would be stable. A solid core would go up the middle of the building with elevators and bathrooms, according to Fox23. The building would also feature a 360-degree rotating restaurant on its top floor, \u00a0and the revolving action seems appropriate given the tower's swirling inspiration. Architects say office space could be easily added and classrooms in its base could help teach visitors about weather safety. 'If you think of St Louis, you think of the Arch. In Seattle, you think of the Space Needle. Tulsa's one of those places where nobody thinks of anything but Indians and dust. And well, maybe tornadoes,' Kinslow said. Tornado Tower, which does not yet have a client to build it, would be held up by a strong core section with elevators. It would be located near the BOK Center (left), a 19,000-seat arena . Tornado Tower would be visible from most of the downtown Tulsa area, and the architect said his team was looking to make 'an elegant looking building'. The state of Oklahoma saw more than 80 tornadoes in 2013, though the number did not reach the 145-tornado record set in 1999, according to the National Weather Service. On top of the tower there would be a terrace designed for reporters to do weather broadcasts. Tulsa's skyline features a number of skyscrapers that would remain taller than the proposed Tornado Tower, including the 52-story Bank of Oklahoma Tower that was designed by the same architects who built the original World Trade Centers.

Thanks to the European Space Agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft. The amazing collection of clips include some that have been artificially amplified to be audible to humans, and others that are simply as they originally sounded. The recent launch of a Soyuz rocket that took two European satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip. It took off from French Guiana at 9.46pm GMT on Friday 27 March (pictured), carrying two satellites that will expand Europe\u2019s Galileo system . The various noises from space are shared on Esa's\u00a0esaops Soundcloud page. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe as it descended onto the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on 14 January 2005. The spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (Hasi), which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended. According to Esa they \u2018give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board Huygens would have heard during one minute of the descent through Titan's atmosphere.\u2019 With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn\u2019t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's \u2018water\u2019 is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. One clip uses audio data collected by the Huygens probe (illustrated) as it descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.

If you haven't seen it, you have likely heard selections from the film's interview with Mukesh Singh, who is on death row for the crime. \"A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy,\" he says. \"When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent.\" Certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as, \"In our culture, there is no place for a woman\" and that if a daughter or sister \"engaged in pre-marital activities ... I would put petrol on her and set her alight.\" Note: Those men are not rapist-murderers. They are their lawyers. Many (I'd like to think most) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny. But these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul. Let's be clear: Singh is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others, but still -- from a cultural script we all share. Yes, we all. Perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was, \"Violence against women is really bad...in India.\" And in many ways, of course, it is. Reports this weekend of a robbery at a Christian school in eastern India, in which, officials said, one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70-year-old nun, add to the narrative. But as unfathomable as this brutality is, we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of American violence-against-women exceptionalism, making others the bad guys while crowing about \"how far women have come\" in the United States. Or to say, \"Sure, we still have issues, but not like that.\" I know that temptation is there. Our global human rights organization, based in the U.S. and India, works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable. When I describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption: that we here in the U.S. are working solely to stop violence against women in India. Yet we do have issues in the U.S., issues \"like that.\" We have mass murderer Elliot Rodger, who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista California last year, wrote his own 137-page version of that same misogynist script. We know from \"The Hunting Ground,\" documentarian Kirby Dick's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women, and many men, have had violated their right to an education free from violence. We know that women are leaving the tech industry, Wall Street, and Internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence. We know that women (and people of all genders) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day. And what of the response? As Zak Cheney-Rice noted, discussing \"India's Daughter\" in Mic.com, \"from India to the U.S., citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims.\" A United Nations report released last week, marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women's rights conference in Beijing, confirms that (as The New York Times put it) \"violence against women -- including rape, murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor, at war and at peace.\" Everywhere. We can't relegate such violence to \"the other,\" to the \"not here, not us, not me.\" To do so is not only incorrect, it is damaging. Yes, we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world's citizens. Yes, violence against women varies in form and degree. But to imagine that violence against women happens only, or mostly, \"somewhere else,\" is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home. Concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves. Likewise, the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists, wherever they live, do not absolve us. We must all ask ourselves: To what degree do we repeat those scripts, or stay silent when we hear them from others? Our actions, and inactions, fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge. We cannot furrow our brows about India, or any of those \"others\" -- abusive men in fraternities, for example -- and be done. Indeed, \"India's Daughter\" premiered in the U.S. with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide.

If you haven't seen it, you have likely heard selections from the film's interview with Mukesh Singh, who is on death row for the crime. \"A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy,\" he says. \"When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent.\" Certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as, \"In our culture, there is no place for a woman\" and that if a daughter or sister \"engaged in pre-marital activities ... I would put petrol on her and set her alight.\" Note: Those men are not rapist-murderers. They are their lawyers. Many (I'd like to think most) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny. But these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul. Let's be clear: Singh is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others, but still -- from a cultural script we all share. Yes, we all. Perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was, \"Violence against women is really bad...in India.\" And in many ways, of course, it is. Reports this weekend of a robbery at a Christian school in eastern India, in which, officials said, one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70-year-old nun, add to the narrative. But as unfathomable as this brutality is, we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of American violence-against-women exceptionalism, making others the bad guys while crowing about \"how far women have come\" in the United States. Or to say, \"Sure, we still have issues, but not like that.\" I know that temptation is there. Our global human rights organization, based in the U.S. and India, works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable. When I describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption: that we here in the U.S. are working solely to stop violence against women in India. Yet we do have issues in the U.S., issues \"like that.\" We have mass murderer Elliot Rodger, who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista California last year, wrote his own 137-page version of that same misogynist script. We know from \"The Hunting Ground,\" documentarian Kirby Dick's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women, and many men, have had violated their right to an education free from violence. We know that women are leaving the tech industry, Wall Street, and Internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence. We know that women (and people of all genders) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day. And what of the response? As Zak Cheney-Rice noted, discussing \"India's Daughter\" in Mic.com, \"from India to the U.S., citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims.\" A United Nations report released last week, marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women's rights conference in Beijing, confirms that (as The New York Times put it) \"violence against women -- including rape, murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor, at war and at peace.\" Everywhere. We can't relegate such violence to \"the other,\" to the \"not here, not us, not me.\" To do so is not only incorrect, it is damaging. Yes, we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world's citizens. Yes, violence against women varies in form and degree. But to imagine that violence against women happens only, or mostly, \"somewhere else,\" is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home. Concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves. Likewise, the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists, wherever they live, do not absolve us. We must all ask ourselves: To what degree do we repeat those scripts, or stay silent when we hear them from others? Our actions, and inactions, fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge. We cannot furrow our brows about India, or any of those \"others\" -- abusive men in fraternities, for example -- and be done. Indeed, \"India's Daughter\" premiered in the U.S. with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide. So let's bring about the day when the next buzzworthy documentary is about the women and men and allies of all genders who have stepped up, together, to say no more: not in my home, not in my school, not in my country, not anywhere.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe bbc four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in delhi premiered. mukesh singh is on death row for the crime. a girl is far more responsible for rape, says he says. reports of a robbery at a christian school in eastern india.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Her new Netflix series, \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" is being criticized online for dealing in offensive humor and stereotypes. The show, which had been picked up by NBC but ultimately dropped, stars Ellie Kemper (\"Bridesmaids,\" \"The Office\") as an upbeat woman stuck in the 1990s after being kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader: not exactly fodder for humor, on its surface. After she's released from an Indiana bunker, Kimmy moves to New York to start a life, and much of the humor comes from her misunderstanding of the modern world, her seventh-grade education and her relationships with a diverse cast of pals. Since its debut, Buzzfeed has declared that the show has a \"major race problem,\" and others criticized its treatment of an Asian character named Dong. Slate says that the critics \"aren't wrong ... but they are missing the point.\" \"Tina Fey's high-wire act is all about the alchemy of making it OK to laugh at big, heavy issues -- like kidnapped women, the experience of undocumented Vietnamese immigrants, and people with Native American ancestry passing as white -- by skimming over them with a light touch,\" Arthur Chu wrote on Slate. The Daily Dot's Jacqueline Keeler wrote that she once hid her Native American past, just like Kimmy's employer, a wealthy woman played by Jane Krakowski. Keeler said that watching the show made her uncomfortable but at the same time praised Fey's \"genius\" writing. But Tituss Burgess, who plays Kimmy's black gay roommate, Titus (whom some have called a stereotype), says the whole controversy is \"ridiculous.\" He told the Huffington Post, \"I just find it hilarious that people are trying to arrest us for doing the opposite of what everyone thinks we're doing.\" The show is certainly not afraid to go right up to the edge with jokes about race, age, class, gender and sexuality. Consider these biting one-liners and bits of dialogue. 1. \"WHITE WOMEN FOUND; Hispanic woman also found.\" An onscreen news graphic zings the media after Kimmy and her bunker-mates are freed. 2. Julian: \"My first wife ...\" Jacqueline: \"... turned 50. And I would never do that to you.\" Kimmy's wealthy employers, Julian and Jacqueline Voorhees, consider their marital difficulties. 3. \"We came all this way in the great iron sky eagle. I'm kidding. I know what planes are; I was in the Air Force.\" Jacqueline's father, Virgil, explains how he and Jacqueline's mother, both Native Americans, traveled to New York to see their daughter. 4. \"You know Disney lies to little girls. Stepmothers aren't scary, and nannies aren't magical, and dwarves do not let you sleep in their house without expecting something.\" Xanthippe Voorhees, the spoiled teen stepdaughter of Kimmy's wealthy employer, offers up a cynical take on the new nanny's Pollyanna-ish (or emotionally stunted) attitude. 5. \"Well, I had a cellphone, Xan, obvs, but I lost it at the zoo. A monkey took it, and she wouldn't give it back. Yeah, Xan, the monkey was a woman. Women can be anything these days.\" Kimmy was underground as cell phone use exploded -- but she hides that truth from most people, especially the vengeful Xanthippe. 6. \"My dad cannot find out about this, please! He'll kill me! Or marry me off to one of his Saudi friends!\" Xanthippe begs for a break like any teen but gives a glimpse at the life of a 1% adolescent. 7. \"I'm not even gonna know what box to check on the hate crime form.\" Such is the life of Titus, Kimmy's roommate, a gay black man from Mississippi, trying to make an acting career in New York. (Warning: The following video is not suitable for kids, or work.) 8. \"Straight guys can be vegetarians. Hitler was a vegetarian.\" Charles, Kimmy's colleague and potential love interest, defends his diet in the most awkward way. 9. \"Yeah, it's real popular now, like taking pictures of your food or being biracial.\" Cyndee, Kimmy's closest friend from her days in the bunker, offers swift commentary on how the world has changed in the 15 years she was away. 10.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nAhead of Super Saturday, Sportsmail's Sir Clive Woodward rates the three contenders for the 2015 RBS 6 Nations title... ENGLAND . Why they can win it . I\u2019m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving. Despite missing chances against Scotland, for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in. George Ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his Bath team-mates starting alongside him. But expect a much tougher defensive line against France. Most importantly, I believe England will win because they need to. In Stuart Lancaster\u2019s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition. A number of these players have been alongside Lancaster throughout and will be just as desperate to win, most notably captain Chris Robshaw. This is their best chance. Bath fly half George Ford has brought confidence to the England backline this season . England and Wasps flanker James Haskell runs with the ball during training at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . Stuart Lancaster has been in charge of England for four seasons but has yet to secure a Six Nations title . They have the points advantage, they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home. Everyone in Twickenham by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere. I expect England to play well. Why they might blow it . I still rate the England pack very highly, though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker. They haven\u2019t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate Graham Rowntree. It\u2019s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off. Geoff Parling coming in is the right call, but I am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench. If there\u2019s an injury early on, can we expect Nick Easter to play most of the game there against France? That could cost England. England forwards coach Graham Rowntree oversees a 'live' scrummaging session between his two packs . There have been many examples recently where England have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score. Lancaster\u2019s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides. Also, France have been written off but that is completely wrong. England will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter. Who would you pay to watch? Jonathan Joseph. He has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world-class potential. I still believe that they need a better footballer at No 12 \u2014 and not picking Henry Slade has been a missed opportunity \u2014 but in Joseph they have a player they can build a team around. It is saying something that Manu Tuilagi\u2019s absence hasn\u2019t been felt too much. I have also been hugely impressed with Ford. Jonathan Joseph has been electric in his year's tournament and has the potential to become world class . VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . The coach\u2019s strengths? England operate more as a team of coaches, headed by Lancaster \u2014 compared with Wales and Ireland where Warren Gatland and Joe Schmidt are very much dominant figures. I always put a great amount of stock in having everyone\u2019s noses pointing in the same direction, but this becomes more difficult with more people involved. There are few coaches around who have achieved this, as Lancaster has with England. Despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing. Surrounding himself with Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere. Wingers Anthony Watson (left) and Jack Nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills . IRELAND . Why they can win it . Between Jonny Sexton, Conor Murray and Paul O\u2019Connell they have the best game management side. They also have a strong set-piece and they do the basics very well. This goes for their kicking game as well, with Rob Kearney and Tommy Bowe\u2019s consistency a real nuisance. They are also playing Scotland, even if the hosts do play better in Edinburgh. And if the game is dead for Scotland with 20 minutes to go, will they mind hugely if it is the Irish not the English who win the tournament? Ireland fly half Jonathan Sexton (centre) gives instructions to his team-mates in Cardiff last Saturday . Why they might blow it . While I don\u2019t think Ireland will be concerned heading to Murrayfield, they need to score at least three tries. They should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points. This would leave England having to win by 15 against France. But can they cross the whitewash enough? Who would you pay to watch? Paul O\u2019Connell. I worked with Paul during the 2005 Lions Tour and although it was a losing tour, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. Whatever position a youngster might play, they should look to how Paul conducts himself on and off the field. His work-rate, commitment and attitude is outstanding, but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is. A real giant of the game. Paul O'Connell rises high to claim a lineout against the Welsh at the Millenium Stadium in round four . The coach\u2019s strengths? Ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics. They are nowhere near as one-dimensional as they have been portrayed. In Joe Schmidt they have the outstanding tactician in the competition. Schmidt is a pragmatist who identifies opponent\u2019s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly. If that involves kicking every other play I have no problem with that. WALES . Why they can win it . They are hitting form at the right time and the way Wales have bounced back from the defeat by England has been truly impressive. I could see them running up a big score against Italy. They have the most to do in terms of points difference, but it would be fascinating if they could do what England did last year and put 50 points on Italy. Wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going. Tighthead prop Samson Lee is a massive loss for Warren Gatland's side ahead of their clash against Italy . Why they might blow it . They need to keep Italy to six points or less. It is the scrum which can cause them problems, taking up territory and time. Losing prop Samson Lee is a massive blow. Who would you pay to watch? Sam Warburton is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere. His work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying. Take five minutes to watch Warburton go about his work. What I like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games. He\u2019s a real warrior any coach would want to work with. Sam Warburton has led Wales superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power . The coach\u2019s strengths? Warren Gatland\u2019s c.v. is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him \u2014 the Welsh style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop, especially when playing an inferior team. Beating Ireland at their own game was brilliant to watch. Gatland brings the best out of Shaun Edwards, his defence coach, and the effort against Ireland was world-class. PREDICTION . Ireland will win by a few, Wales will win by a lot and England will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points. If I had a free bet, I\u2019d put it on Ireland because if the Scots implode they could rack up points.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsir clive woodward rates the contenders for the 2015 rbs 6 nations title. stuart lancaster's side are yet to win this competition. george ford has brought two of his bath team-mates starting alongside him. despite missing chances, runners consistently found clean air to run in. bath fly half george ford has brought confidence to the england backline.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Mark, 45, from Glasgow suffers from lymphangitis - a painful swelling of his legs - and is at risk of diabetes because of his size. He struggles with his mobility and has had to have hand rails and extra banisters fitted around his home to help him use the stairs. He also needs straps to help him lift his limbs into bed and can't put his own shoes on because of his girth. Scroll down for video . Scottish Mark who tips the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS in order to lose weight . 'I feel restricted in what I can do, caged,' the father admitted. He said gastric bypass surgery, which costs \u00a39,000 on the NHS, is his only hope. 'I have always been a big guy. From the age of 13 a lot of drink and food. I reckon lager had a lot to do with the weight initially,' he explained. 'I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I have lost weight and it's the easiest thing in the world to put it back on. All I am looking for is help to keep it off by restricting what I can eat.' He says his problem with food is an addiction and he should be supported in the same way people are when they try to give up addictions to cigarettes and alcohol. 'Especially in Scotland we live in a fried culture, everything is fried and greasy or fat, usually that stuff tastes the best. There's not enough healthy options out there. 'It's an addiction, all I want is that wee bit of help.' Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show\u00a0NHS: \u00a32bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat. Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show NHS: \u00a32bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat . Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time. He can't afford to pay for the op privately as he was made redundant from his job at a delivery company two years ago and is now on benefits. He said: 'It all boils down to money. Your life means nothing if it costs too much.' He admitted he knows people watching will think he doesn't deserve to have the operation on the NHS. But in the long run, it could save NHS funds as they wouldn't have to treat him for diabetes or other health conditions he may develop as a result of his obesity in the future. Professor David Kerrigan, a bariatric surgeon who treats both NHS and private patients, agrees that weight loss surgery can be cost effective for the NHS. He said: 'I know a lot of people won't have any sympathy for the sort of patients I treat but these people have real problems. They are not a little bit chubby wanting to look better, they are ill because of the obesity they developed. 'I don't care how or why they got it, I know they are at the bottom of a deep hole they can't get out of and the surgery offers them an escape. 'This surgery is transformative for people's lives, there are very few operations we do that can achieve that.' Marks added: 'If it stops me getting diabetes then it benefits me and them, those costs can then go somewhere else.' The show also interviews other people desperate to be treated on the NHS to show viewers how difficult it can be to decide whose need is greater. There are children born with cerebral palsy who need\u00a0Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) - a procedure that can significantly reduce muscle stiffness helping them to walk more easily and reducing painful muscle spasms. Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time . Meanwhile, Becky, 24, from\u00a0Grimsby, is one of thousands of women in the UK in need of IVF treatment in order to fulfill her dream to become a mother. Three cycles of IVF on the NHS costs\u00a0\u00a310,000 and Becky has been denied the treatment because her partner, Mark, 38, a scaffolder, already has a child from a previous relationship. Becky is infertile thanks to getting an STI when she was a teenager and she said she's heartbroken that IVF is her only chance to have a baby. She said: 'When I was younger I couldn't wait to grow up and have a family. I have always loved kids so when you have been told you face a life with no children it's pretty tough, you have to live with that every day, it's not a nice feeling. 'It guts you to think you were stupid enough to trust someone and they gave you an STI. And then to find out later in life that's the reason you can't have children, it guts me. 'I sometimes feel disgusted with myself. People make mistakes, I was young and stupid, it was not my fault. I didn't know he was sleeping with Tom, Dick and Harry behind my back. 'It's so hard, family and friends keep making announcements that they are having a baby and you are happy for them but deep down you're gutted as it's all you ever wanted.'

Mark, 45, from Glasgow suffers from lymphangitis - a painful swelling of his legs - and is at risk of diabetes because of his size. He struggles with his mobility and has had to have hand rails and extra banisters fitted around his home to help him use the stairs. He also needs straps to help him lift his limbs into bed and can't put his own shoes on because of his girth. Scroll down for video . Scottish Mark who tips the scales at 35 stone due to years of binge drinking and eating junk food says he should be given gastric bypass surgery on the NHS in order to lose weight . 'I feel restricted in what I can do, caged,' the father admitted. He said gastric bypass surgery, which costs \u00a39,000 on the NHS, is his only hope. 'I have always been a big guy. From the age of 13 a lot of drink and food. I reckon lager had a lot to do with the weight initially,' he explained. 'I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I have lost weight and it's the easiest thing in the world to put it back on. All I am looking for is help to keep it off by restricting what I can eat.' He says his problem with food is an addiction and he should be supported in the same way people are when they try to give up addictions to cigarettes and alcohol. 'Especially in Scotland we live in a fried culture, everything is fried and greasy or fat, usually that stuff tastes the best. There's not enough healthy options out there. 'It's an addiction, all I want is that wee bit of help.' Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show\u00a0NHS: \u00a32bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat. Mark shares his story on Channel 4 show NHS: \u00a32bn A Week And Counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat . Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time. He can't afford to pay for the op privately as he was made redundant from his job at a delivery company two years ago and is now on benefits. He said: 'It all boils down to money. Your life means nothing if it costs too much.' He admitted he knows people watching will think he doesn't deserve to have the operation on the NHS. But in the long run, it could save NHS funds as they wouldn't have to treat him for diabetes or other health conditions he may develop as a result of his obesity in the future. Professor David Kerrigan, a bariatric surgeon who treats both NHS and private patients, agrees that weight loss surgery can be cost effective for the NHS. He said: 'I know a lot of people won't have any sympathy for the sort of patients I treat but these people have real problems. They are not a little bit chubby wanting to look better, they are ill because of the obesity they developed. 'I don't care how or why they got it, I know they are at the bottom of a deep hole they can't get out of and the surgery offers them an escape. 'This surgery is transformative for people's lives, there are very few operations we do that can achieve that.' Marks added: 'If it stops me getting diabetes then it benefits me and them, those costs can then go somewhere else.' The show also interviews other people desperate to be treated on the NHS to show viewers how difficult it can be to decide whose need is greater. There are children born with cerebral palsy who need\u00a0Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) - a procedure that can significantly reduce muscle stiffness helping them to walk more easily and reducing painful muscle spasms. Mark, who has been married to wife Lorraine for 30 years, has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the NHS in Scotland for a third time . Meanwhile, Becky, 24, from\u00a0Grimsby, is one of thousands of women in the UK in need of IVF treatment in order to fulfill her dream to become a mother. Three cycles of IVF on the NHS costs\u00a0\u00a310,000 and Becky has been denied the treatment because her partner, Mark, 38, a scaffolder, already has a child from a previous relationship. Becky is infertile thanks to getting an STI when she was a teenager and she said she's heartbroken that IVF is her only chance to have a baby. She said: 'When I was younger I couldn't wait to grow up and have a family. I have always loved kids so when you have been told you face a life with no children it's pretty tough, you have to live with that every day, it's not a nice feeling. 'It guts you to think you were stupid enough to trust someone and they gave you an STI. And then to find out later in life that's the reason you can't have children, it guts me. 'I sometimes feel disgusted with myself. People make mistakes, I was young and stupid, it was not my fault. I didn't know he was sleeping with Tom, Dick and Harry behind my back.

The three-year-old, about 125-pound mountain lion was seen outside of the Macy's at the Promenade Mall in Temecula at about 6am, NBC\u00a0reports. The Riverside County Sheriff's Department contacted the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety, The Los Angeles Times\u00a0reports. The lion died while it was being transported. Mountain Lion: A mountain lion (photographed) that wandered near a southern California shopping center died after being tranquilized by a game warden . Truck: A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety . Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, said that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor . Rare:\u00a0spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being darted, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine . A necropsy will be performed on the mountain lion. A spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being struck with a tranquilizer, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine. 'They tried to do the right thing,' Foy told NBC. 'They have the training and equipment to do the right thing... and it doesn't always work out.' A witness told KTLA\u00a0that the animal was underneath a trailer for about 45 minutes before authorities arrived. The mall wasn't open, and only a few store employees were around in the early hours. But the mountain lion was reportedly first spotted near a freeway. The animal was not aggressive, the LAT Times reports. Officials say the animal could have made his way to the mall area for a number of reasons including simply looking for a suitable habitat.

Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as \u2018a unique moment in anyone\u2019s life\u2019. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince\u2019s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne\u2019s frustrations is the so-called \u2018Middletonisation\u2019 of his son William\u2019s life \u2014 specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole\u2019s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called \u2018March of the Middletons\u2019 that he has complained to friends: \u2018They never let me see my grandson.\u2019 Adds a source: \u2018Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.\u2019 It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles\u2019s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it\u2019s a deliberate move on William\u2019s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles\u2019s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate\u2019s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot\u2019s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William\u2019s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

Lopes, 19, is on a season-long loan with Les Dogues, making 19 appearances in all competitions to date. 'When I came to Lille I was hoping to get playing time, but this season has gone beyond my expectations,' Lopes told L'Equipe reporters. Manchester City midfielder Marcos Lopes (centre, pictured in January 2014) could remain at Lille . 'I feel really good now. I feel more responsibility. This is important, because it means they believe in me.' Asked about his future plans, the playmaker added: 'I have a contract with Manchester City.

Kemeys Folly, in Langstone, near Newport in South Wales, starred in the popular Channel 4 programme six years ago when it was converted into a six-bedroom luxury house - and now owners Sarah and Dean Berry have put the unusual property up for sale. The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of a castellated 18th Century hunting lodge with the construction of a state of-the-art glass extension. Scroll down for video . Kemeys Folly (pictured) starred in popular property show Grand Designs six years ago. Its owners have now put the unusual home up for sale . Owners Sarah and Dean Berry have now put the unusual Grade II listed six-bedroom home up for sale for \u00a31,999,950 . The ambitious project saw the couple combine the painstaking restoration of the old hunting lodge with a state of-the-art glass extension . The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the tower in 2005, which was being sold by a couple who had quickly realised that there was far too much work to do, and put it back on the market. Work on Kemeys started in January 2007 and over the next year an old extension was demolished, the outside of the tower was re-pointed and the inside was stripped as much as the building's listed status would allow. Now, The Grade II listed home boasts six bedrooms, five of which have en-suite bathrooms - and including a master bedroom which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace. Sitting in 23 acres of land the property also boasts a cinema room in the older part of the building and outside there is a large pool house with swimming pool and changing facilities. The folly also has four stables which back directly onto a paddock. The glass extension takes full advantage of the stunning hilltop location - on a clear day you can see 11 counties as well as the two Severn road bridges and the Bristol Channel. The owners say the surrounding woodland is perfect for long walks, and which features lots of wildlife, including deer. Something of a local landmark, the original building was a hunting lodge dating back to the 1700s and was at one point owned by the Sheriff of Monmouth. The folly is situated in the heart of the Usk Valley in South Wales and has a roof terrace which enjoys this view over the  countryside . The house boasts a master bedroom and en suite which takes up a whole floor of the tower and opens up on to its own roof terrace . It was struck by lightning in 1890, rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and was eventually converted into a house for the Sheriff of Monmouth . The couple paid \u00a3830,000 for the folly in 2005 and spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it and bringing it up to scratch . Mrs Berry said: 'We bought it with a view to carrying out significant work on it, renovating the tower and extending it. 'It was one of those love at first sight moments. We were in London at the time but knew we wanted to move back here to where we grew up. 'Neither of us even knew it existed but when we saw it we wanted it. It was just outstanding.' The couple spent a huge amount of time with planners to agree on a concept for the home that everyone was happy with. She said: 'The idea was to keep the original features of the main building, such as the beautiful exposed stonework, but not to mimic what was already there in the extension. 'We wanted to create new sections that helped to tell the story of the building through the years and were an expression of the 21st century. 'Living here has been such fun.' A former hunting lodge, the folly was built in 1712 by local landowner George Kemeys. It was struck by lightning in the late 1890s, partially rebuilt as a home in the early 1900s and converted into a house for TE Watson, the High Sheriff of Monmouthshire. The couple are selling as they are downsizing but say: 'Whoever takes Kemeys Folly on now is going to enjoy such an amazing life here.' The house is for sale for \u00a31,999,950 with Chewton Rose.

Ayesha Bhatti, 29, from Derby, found several mini-Wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks. The crisps were dwarved by the regular versions, which measure around 3.5cm, much to the amusement of her family. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-three Ayesha Bhatti, 29, says she was shocked to open a bag of her favourite crisps and discovered the world's smallest Wotsits inside . 'I have never seen Wotsits as small as that,' said the full-time mother, who bought the packets in the Derby branch of discount store Home Bargains on Wednesday last week. 'It's so funny. My family eats quite a lot of them and I like them because they're not oily like other crisps. 'I think these ones could possibly be the smallest in the world. What are the chances of finding so many at once? It's very unusual. 'They certainly wouldn't fill you up but I suppose they're good if you're on a diet.' The crisps were dwarved by the regular versions, which measure around 3.5cm, much to the amusement of Ms Bhatti and her family . Ms Bhatti said she has not contacted manufacturers Walkers over the minature crisps, but said she would do if she found more. 'I don't feel ripped off,' she said. 'At the end of the day they're Wotsits. I haven't spoken to Walkers about it and I didn't take them back to the shop. 'I don't feel hard done by, it's quite funny really, my kids think they're hilarious. 'But if it happened again, I would probably have a word with Walkers. Ms Bhatti found several mini-Wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks which she bought at a discount retailer in Derby . 'I'd already seen a post on Facebook where somebody was saying they had small Wotsits so I'm not the only one.'

It can be used with hundreds of musical apps, such as GarageBand because it recognises universal gestures, such as strumming, tapping, bowing and sliding, for example. Because if its just rectangular in shape, the instrument, which measures  23.5 inches (60cm) long, can be played in a number of ways. For example, it can be held under the chin like a violin or laid flat on a table like a piano. Artiphon, the Nashville Tennessee-based team behind Instrument 1, say the device is designed for musicians and complete amateurs, because it is intuitive to use. \u2018We believe anyone can make music, and that most people really want to,\u2019 the start-up wrote on its Kickstarter page. The gadget connects to a smartphone, tablet or computer, to allow a user to play any instrument, style and sound on it.\u00a0Because if its non-descript shape, the instrument can be played in a number of ways.

They will be able to make new instrument presets and play them straight away, or use a bow on a banjo and pluck a drum. There are plans to create a version for the Apple Watch and allow an iPhone to be used as a bow, for example. The app is being developed for Apple devices. It has digital strings that stand in for a guitar\u2019s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys. The sound of notes can be changed by using guitar techniques on the fingerboard or by strumming on the bridge, as well as pressing hard and softly. \u2018If you\u2019re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine,\u2019 the firm said. \u2018And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.\u2019 The device enables musicians to re-tune it instantly and turn frets on and off, allowing people to slide between notes seamlessly and use vibrato to make the sound \u2018quiver\u2019 - a technique used by professional violinists. Instrument 1 (pictured) has digital strings that stand in for a guitar\u2019s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys. It measures 23.5 inches (60cm) long . Because the machine is a simply retangular shape and can be used as any instrument, users can play the instrument in different ways. People can hold it under their chins like a violin, or place it on a table like a keyboard, for example. 'If you want to play like a guitar, you can chord and strum in familiar ways,' the start-up's Kickstarter page says. 'In a piano preset, put it on your lap and the frets become \u201ckeys\u201d like a piano (with up to six stacked octaves at your fingertips!). 'If you\u2019re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine. 'And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.' They can even assign different instrument sounds to different strings, to play several instruments at once. The firm is working on an app that lets people use an iPhone like a bow as well as an app for the Apple Watch. \u2018We\u2019ve designed the Instrument 1 to adapt to the way you want to play, and it scales in complexity based on your style and skills.\u2019 The company\u2019s aim is to create a customisable and \u2018effortless\u2019 instrument that can be used by anyone. \u2018Tune it all to E-major if you like, adjust the sensitivity, or forget strumming altogether and let it auto-play the notes you press,\u2019 it said. \u2018The Instrument 1 grows with you as you explore new styles of playing. \u2018You can increase complexity as you go, allowing for greater control over every aspect of your performance with its feather-touch playing surface.

There are plans to create a version for the Apple Watch and allow an iPhone to be used as a bow, for example. The app is being developed for Apple devices. It has digital strings that stand in for a guitar\u2019s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys. The sound of notes can be changed by using guitar techniques on the fingerboard or by strumming on the bridge, as well as pressing hard and softly. \u2018If you\u2019re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine,\u2019 the firm said. \u2018And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.\u2019 The device enables musicians to re-tune it instantly and turn frets on and off, allowing people to slide between notes seamlessly and use vibrato to make the sound \u2018quiver\u2019 - a technique used by professional violinists. Instrument 1 (pictured) has digital strings that stand in for a guitar\u2019s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys. It measures 23.5 inches (60cm) long . Because the machine is a simply retangular shape and can be used as any instrument, users can play the instrument in different ways. People can hold it under their chins like a violin, or place it on a table like a keyboard, for example. 'If you want to play like a guitar, you can chord and strum in familiar ways,' the start-up's Kickstarter page says. 'In a piano preset, put it on your lap and the frets become \u201ckeys\u201d like a piano (with up to six stacked octaves at your fingertips!). 'If you\u2019re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine. 'And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.' They can even assign different instrument sounds to different strings, to play several instruments at once. The firm is working on an app that lets people use an iPhone like a bow as well as an app for the Apple Watch. \u2018We\u2019ve designed the Instrument 1 to adapt to the way you want to play, and it scales in complexity based on your style and skills.\u2019 The company\u2019s aim is to create a customisable and \u2018effortless\u2019 instrument that can be used by anyone. \u2018Tune it all to E-major if you like, adjust the sensitivity, or forget strumming altogether and let it auto-play the notes you press,\u2019 it said. \u2018The Instrument 1 grows with you as you explore new styles of playing. \u2018You can increase complexity as you go, allowing for greater control over every aspect of your performance with its feather-touch playing surface. It's always in tune, and you'll never break a string!\u2019 The instrument is Midi-compatible \u2013 the standard used by most digital music programmes - and works with hundreds of apps (an example is shown) and software such as ProTools and Logic . To go off piste, the instrument can be plugged into a tablet or computer so it can make any sound imaginable, such as synthesiser noises. The instrument is Midi-compatible \u2013 the standard used by most digital music programmes - and works with hundreds of apps and software such as ProTools and Logic. It can also be connected to iPhones, iPads, Macs and PCs via Lightning connector or USB. Users can  keep things simple by hearing their musical creation using Instrument 1\u2019s built-in speakers. \u2018It's loud enough to play and sing along with friends, and \u2026of course, there\u2019s a headphone output if you want to keep it quiet until you drop the album,\u2019 the company said. Instrument 1 is available to pre-order via Kickstarter from $349 (\u00a3228) in black white. A 'Nashville edition with a would  back is available for $899 (\u00a3586) With 39 days of crowd funding left, the company has already raised over twice as much cash as its $75,000 (\u00a348,897) goal.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\n` instrument 1' claims to be one electronic device that can be used as a variety of instruments. the gadget connects to a smartphone, tablet or computer. ` instrument 1' claims to be a electronic device that lets you 'be the whole band' the instrument can be played in a number of ways. it can be used with hundreds of musical apps, such as garageband because it recognises universal gestures.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Signals from the planet were initially discovered in 2010, but last year dismissed as noise from distant stars. Scroll down for video . Astronomers believe mysterious 'alien signals' - previously dismissed as stellar bursts - are in fact coming from an Earth-like planet. The Gliese 581d planet was initially discovered in 2010 (artist's impression pictured) Now, a further study claims that the 2014 research was based on 'inadequate analyses of the data' and that\u00a0Gliese 581d does exist. The planet was initially discovered in 2010. It was the first Earth-like planet found in the 'Goldilocks'-zone around another star. But soon after the discovery, a group of scientists said the signals thought to be from a planet were in fact simply magnetic bursts from stars. The latest study claims that the stellar bursts research was based on 'inadequate analyses of the data'. They said the method is suitable for large planets, but the technique is unable to find small planets like GJ 581d. Last year, Pennsylvania State University researchers said Gliese 581d - and its companion Gliese 581g - were simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star 22 light-years away. The new British research, however, argues the method used by the Pennsylvania team was only suitable for large planets, and that it could miss small ones like GJ 581d. The study, by Queen Mary University, London and the University of Hertfordshire, claims to use a more accurate model on the existing data. 'The existence (or not) of GJ 581d is significant because it was the first Earth-like planet discovered in the 'Goldilocks'-zone around another star and it is a benchmark case for the Doppler technique,' said lead author, Dr Guillem Anglada-Escud\u00e9. 'There are always discussions among scientists about the ways we interpret data but I'm confident that GJ 581d has been in orbit around Gliese 581 all along. 'In any case, the strength of their statement was way too strong.

When the judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she seemed only happy to oblige. 'OK, I need a break anyway,' she said. Monique Miller, 34 (right), told a judge on Tuesday that she needs a break from parenting after her arrest for throwing her baby out of a car . Miller was also ordered on Tuesday to take all of her prescribed medications . Cops allegedly tried to pull Miller over Monday afternoon during a routine traffic stop,when the mother was driving with her baby on her lap. Miller at first refused, but when she eventually complied she started yelling obscenities at officers and then tossed her baby out the window. Luckily an officer was able to catch the baby safely. It's unclear how old the baby is. Miller was arrested in the incident, in which she also kicked the cop's car door, causing the door to slam into his head.

Martin Freeman, one of Britain\u2019s most bankable Hollywood stars, was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity backer of Labour\u2019s 2015 general election campaign. The millionaire actor, who has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the Hobbit trilogy, was the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insisted Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019. Millionaire actor Martin Freeman (pictured) is the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insists Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019 But last night, the Labour leader faced embarrassment after it emerged that Freeman is a former supporter of Arthur Scargill\u2019s far-left socialist party which openly refused to vote Labour at the 2005 general election. Freeman himself also faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he sends his son to a \u00a312,000-a-year private school. Not only that, but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill \u2013 despite Freeman having an estimated fortune of \u00a310million. In last night\u2019s three-minute broadcast, Freeman, who found fame in the satirical British sitcom The Office, said: \u2018I don\u2019t know about you, but my values are about community, compassion, decency; that\u2019s how I was brought up.\u2019 Freeman with his partner Amanda Abbington (pictured) who declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill, despite living with Freeman, who is worth more than \u00a310million . In an address straight to the camera, the 43-year-old, who also stars in Sherlock, claimed the Tories would take the country on a \u2018rollercoaster of cuts\u2019 while Labour would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few, like me\u2019.

But last night it emerged that Mr Freeman spent years supporting a far-left Socialist Labour Party that was set up by the militant miners\u2019 union boss Arthur Scargill in protest at New Labour. In an interview with the Guardian ahead of the 2005 election, Freeman declared that he voted for the party in 2001 and would not back Tony Blair. Asked how he would vote that year, he replied: \u2018Not Labour\u2019.

Miss Abbington, who also appears in Sherlock, had been with Freeman for 11 years at the time. The couple have two children. The revelations sparked an outpouring of bad publicity for the couple, prompting Miss Abbington to settle her debts.

She told the Radio Times later in 2013: \u2018It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s being sorted out. It was a big mistake and I\u2019m sorting it out right now. \u2018It\u2019s being paid off now. I would never want to go through this again. But I\u2019m paying it off.\u2019 Freeman\u2019s decision to back Labour appeared to win the enthusiastic backing of Miss Abbington, who posted a message on Twitter saying: \u2018F*** the Tories.\u2019 Labour said the party election broadcast had received \u2018unprecedented\u2019 interest on the internet, with hundreds of thousands of people choosing to watch. The actor appears in front of a plain white background and, despite encouraging voters to put Labour in power, makes no mention of Mr Miliband or the prospect of him becoming the next prime minister. Instead, he focuses on contrasting Labour\u2019s \u2018values\u2019 with those of the Tories, who he claims \u2018have got sod all to offer the young\u2019. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: \u2018Labour is trying to whitewash Ed Miliband from their campaign \u2013 his MPs don\u2019t want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast doesn\u2019t even mention him.'\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nmartin freeman, one of britain's most bankable hollywood stars, was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity. the millionaire has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the hobbit trilogy. he sends his son to a # 12,000-a-year private school. but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid tax bill. freeman is a former supporter of arthur scargill's far-left socialist party.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Much like Father Christmas, the brown-coloured animals was often depicted carrying a selection of treats to good children's houses. But while the traditional version of the rabbit was a natural-looking creature, the modern character has become an often terrifying white, pink, purple and yellow creation. The Easter bunny is meant to be a joyful character, but often botched costumes mean they are more horrific than happy, as this picture demonstrates . The symbol of the Easter often results in a terrifying sight when produced on a budget. Children who would usually be delighted to be meeting someone who will be gifting them with chocolate eggs end up screaming for their parents. As reported by Metro, unfortunate humans who have been given the task of dressing up as the rabbit end up looking more like the terrifying Donnie Darko character than a friendly furball.

This one's goofier and tastier, and won't leave you needing a change of clothes.  It's the #TwizzlerChallenge. So what's this challenge all about?  Think of the spaghetti scene from \"Lady and the Tramp,\" except substitute a Twizzler for the noodle. Chomp and chomp and chomp until your lips meet in the middle, then smooch.  Simple enough. You're supposed to do a video, of course, and challenge others to do the same for a good cause. The ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on Comedy Central's \"Night of Too Many Stars,\" a fundraiser for autism programs. A tweet from sportscaster Fred Katz challenged the \"Today\" show's Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba, who plays  Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" to share a \"Lady and the Tramp\" licorice. It took off from there.  Next thing you knew, Geist was repeating the stunt with Meredith Vieira and the #TwizzlerChallenge was on. Geist and Vieira challenged Matt Lauer and Kathy Lee Gifford.  They were good sports about it, but you may want to close your eyes here.  This isn't for the faint of heart. The challenge is starting to invade social media.  Just search the hashtag #TwizzlerChallenge. It sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at Twizzlers.  Their candy is on the lips of America. And to their credit, a couple of Twizzlers executives took the challenge and donated $10,000. The money goes to New York Collaborates for Autism.  The group funds and creates schools, programs and services for people with autism nationwide. Since 2006, \"Night of Too Many Stars\" has raised over $22 million.  If this challenge is even half as successful as the Ice Bucket Challenge, that number will triple.

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: \u2018These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it\u2019s all about submission and domination when of course it isn\u2019t. \u2018People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I\u2019m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.\u2019 This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said \u2018it\u2019s worse now, but I\u2019m an old person so I would say that.\u2019 She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that \u2018it\u2019s a huge problem in society.\u2019 Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine\u2019s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society\u2019s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: \u2018There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.

The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: \u2018These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it\u2019s all about submission and domination when of course it isn\u2019t. \u2018People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I\u2019m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.\u2019 This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said \u2018it\u2019s worse now, but I\u2019m an old person so I would say that.\u2019 She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that \u2018it\u2019s a huge problem in society.\u2019 Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine\u2019s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society\u2019s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: \u2018There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. They didn\u2019t have sex education, mainly at schools.\u2019 Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers\u2019 \u2018big sister\u2019 imparting advice.

Ancelotti praised his side for their performance before the break in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Levante but said he was concerned by the way his players relaxed and let the visitors off the hook in the second period. A Gareth Bale double, his first goals in 10 matches, had put Real in control by halftime and they appeared to be cruising to a big win but Levante pushed Real hard in the second half and had chances to get back into the game. Gareth Bale scored his first goals in 10 games to help Real Madrid to a 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday . Bale has received a lot of criticism, but silenced his doubters with a La Liga double at the Bernabeu . It was not the dominant performance Real needed to silence their critics after three matches without a win but at least meant they will only be a point behind Barca when they run out at the Nou Camp. 'The whole team showed more desire and focus and they all understood what they had to do,' Ancelotti told a news conference. 'We did that in one part of the match and on Sunday we need to do that for the whole match,' added the Italian. Both goals were scored in the first half, and Carlo Ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity . Real Madrid travel to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona in their next match; a potentially title-deciding game . 'We played with confidence in the first half, the second worries me a bit. 'We were more relaxed and played a more horizontal game. We lacked verticality.' Bale, in particular, looked like he had a point to prove against Levante after he was one of the players targeted with whistles by Real fans upset with the team's recent poor form. Ancelotti said Bale's resurgence may have something to do with the return to action of midfielder Luka Modric, who he played with at Tottenham Hotspur, after a four-month injury layoff. Barcelona have been in brilliant form and are now top of La Liga after winning at the weekend . Real Madrid have slipped behind Barcelona to second in La Liga, and need to win to regain first position . 'Bale looked more motivated and more hungry,' Ancelotti said. 'The presence of Modric offers more depth for Bale to link up with his team mates. 'They know each other well, they played together at Tottenham, and there's no doubt that Bale is more comfortable with Modric on the pitch.' Real have the rest of the week to prepare for Sunday's showdown at Barca, who take a 2-1 lead into their Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Manchester City on Wednesday.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ngareth bale scored his first goal in 10 games to help real madrid. ancelotti's side were at home to levante in the second period. real madrid will play with barcelona in sunday's la liga 'clasico' bale has received a lot of criticism but silenced his doubters. carlo ancelotti says they must have 90 minutes of intensity.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The chance to play, captain and manage the club ensured that, for long enough, the love affair was requited. A year ago, though, a long-standing relationship hit the buffers with a rather dull thud. Widely acclaimed for the way he led the club throughout administration and a season of near-certain relegation, the 39-year-old awoke one day having to digest one of the game\u2019s great truths: No one is indispensable. Gary Locke is currently manager at Kilmarnock after leaving his post at Hears last year . Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson last season . Brutally axed as Ann Budge and Craig Levein made way for Robbie Neilson, Locke licked his wounds before returning to Kilmarnock, initially as assistant manager to Allan Johnston. What\u2019s transpired since the parting of the ways has been utterly intriguing for both parties. Neilson\u2019s side romped to the Championship title with seven games to spare to mute anyone still clinging to the notion that they were wrong to dispense with Locke\u2019s services. Yet, in only losing one of seven games since taking the reins from Johnson last month at Rugby Park, Locke, in turn, has underscored his dug-out credentials and then some. Would Hearts have won the Championship title with him still at the helm? We shall never know. But, as he puts the finishing touches to a new long-term deal in Ayrshire this week, the growing feeling among observers is that his former employers were perhaps both right and wrong. \u2018I don\u2019t think I have proven a point to Hearts,\u2019 Locke insisted. \u2018I didn\u2019t feel I had anything to prove. I did a good job there. \u2018It is like any football club. When new people come in, if they have their own ideas and want to change things then that is what they will do. \u2018I am delighted to see them coming straight back up - they have some cracking young players there and it is great to see them do so well. \u2018But my focus now is Kilmarnock. All I want is the best for them. Hopefully, we can finish the season strongly.\u2019 Privately for Locke, the irony of what\u2019s gone on at Tynecastle over the past year or so won\u2019t be so much painful as excruciating. Locke insists his focus is on Kilmarnock and wants to end the season strongly in the Scottish Premiership . Last season, boxed in by administration and a transfer embargo, he played the kids. Fledglings like Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker featured in sides that were routinely thrashed. Some feared for the psychological impact it would have on them but Locke knew what he was doing. To say the experience has stood them in good stead is a huge understatement. Supported by a string of more experienced campaigners, those little boys lost have flourished under Neilson\u2019s tutelage. Might it be said that the club which binned Locke now owe him a huge debt of thanks? \u2018You probably have to ask people at Hearts,\u2019 he added. \u2018I think the young lads certainly learned the hard way. A lot of them had to play when they probably were not ready. \u2018I think that certainly set them up for this season and full credit to them. They have had a fantastic season, they have played some great stuff and scored lots of goals. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve been in touch with couple of them. They didn\u2019t thank me and I didn\u2019t want them to. \u2018I\u2019m just glad to see them doing very well because I knew they all had fantastic potential. \u2018It\u2019s good to see them all fulfilling it.\u2019 A consummate professional all his days, Locke\u2019s dedication to Kilmarnock is now absolute. And yet, when the prospect of returning to Tynecastle next term is put to him, the broad grin on his face says it all. Locke says he is happy to see the youngsters come through in Edinburgh after working with them last year . \u2018It will be strange going back,\u2019 he conceded. \u2018I went back as a Kilmarnock player and all I want now is for Kilmarnock to win games. \u2018You\u2019ve got to be professional. I was very fortunate in life in that the team I grew up supporting, I managed to play for, captain and manage. \u2018There\u2019s not a lot of people who can say that. \u2018But my only focus now is Kilmarnock football club. I\u2019m employed here and I want to very best for them.\u2019 Be that as it may, does what happened in Gorgie getting on a year ago still rankle with him? \u2018Not at all. It\u2019s football,\u2019 Locke insisted. \u2018One of my best mates in the game, Davie Weir, is at Brentford. You see the job he\u2019s done there with Mark Warburton yet they are leaving at the end of the season. Nothing surprises you. \u2018It\u2019s a game that\u2019s great to be involved in but it can be tough, as well. I\u2019m not the type of person that feels sorry for myself. You\u2019ve got to take these things on the chin and move forward. Fortunately for me, I got a great opportunity back here and hopefully I can take it.\u2019 That new contract should be inked by the end of this week and then the building for the future can start in earnest. The 39-year-old manager admits it will be strange facing his former club Hearts next season . Finally, without the yokes of administration and the intentions of new owners, Locke is relishing the chance to lead the Rugby Park side unhindered. Diplomacy prevented him talking openly of his desire to see Kris Boyd assume a playing/coaching role next term but it\u2019s evidently part of Locke\u2019s plans. \u2018Obviously I played with Kris, he\u2019s a friend of mine and possibly because I was sitting beside him at Ibrox on Saturday, someone saw me,\u2019 he said. \u2018He\u2019s very much a Rangers player and his focus is obviously trying to get Rangers back in the top flight. \u2018It\u2019s not for me to speculate on other team\u2019s players as they have a lot of big games ahead. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be right of me to comment on Kris Boyd. I\u2019m not sure how many goals he has scored this season but he has still contributed eight or nine goals. \u2018If we had a striker contributing that, we might be in the top six. I know Boydy well and I\u2019m pretty sure that wherever he ends up next season, he will score goals because that\u2019s what he does.\u2019 The prospect of Boyd returning to Kilmarnock for a third spell will gladden the hearts of the Rugby Park faithful. The striker may have endured a poor season second time around at Rangers but, at 31, still has the capacity to ensure a return to his first club is a successful one. For Locke, too, Rugby Park has largely been a very happy second home. For all his strong Tynecastle links, it was in East Ayrshire that he spent seven years as a player. And, after being cut-adrift by Hearts last summer, it was Killie that offered him a way back into the game. You sense that\u2019s something that will never be forgotten. Locke was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park . \u2018I played at Killie for seven years and I know what they are capable of,\u2019 he added. \u2018The facilities here are fantastic. I spend a lot of time down here and I see what the club is doing in the local community. \u2018There are kids here every single night of the week, which is fantastic to see. Things are really positive. \u2018When I played here there were a lot of Celtic and Rangers strips about the town and now there are lots of Killie ones so that\u2019s encouraging in terms of the future. \u2018Hopefully, we can see a lot of these younger kids coming through like we do at the moment - we have eight academy players in the first team which is great. \u2018The club is moving forward in the right direction and hopefully it can keep moving forward.\u2019 GARY LOCKE was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park.

All I want is the best for them. Hopefully, we can finish the season strongly.\u2019 Privately for Locke, the irony of what\u2019s gone on at Tynecastle over the past year or so won\u2019t be so much painful as excruciating. Locke insists his focus is on Kilmarnock and wants to end the season strongly in the Scottish Premiership . Last season, boxed in by administration and a transfer embargo, he played the kids. Fledglings like Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker featured in sides that were routinely thrashed. Some feared for the psychological impact it would have on them but Locke knew what he was doing. To say the experience has stood them in good stead is a huge understatement. Supported by a string of more experienced campaigners, those little boys lost have flourished under Neilson\u2019s tutelage. Might it be said that the club which binned Locke now owe him a huge debt of thanks? \u2018You probably have to ask people at Hearts,\u2019 he added. \u2018I think the young lads certainly learned the hard way. A lot of them had to play when they probably were not ready. \u2018I think that certainly set them up for this season and full credit to them. They have had a fantastic season, they have played some great stuff and scored lots of goals. \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve been in touch with couple of them. They didn\u2019t thank me and I didn\u2019t want them to. \u2018I\u2019m just glad to see them doing very well because I knew they all had fantastic potential. \u2018It\u2019s good to see them all fulfilling it.\u2019 A consummate professional all his days, Locke\u2019s dedication to Kilmarnock is now absolute. And yet, when the prospect of returning to Tynecastle next term is put to him, the broad grin on his face says it all. Locke says he is happy to see the youngsters come through in Edinburgh after working with them last year . \u2018It will be strange going back,\u2019 he conceded. \u2018I went back as a Kilmarnock player and all I want now is for Kilmarnock to win games. \u2018You\u2019ve got to be professional. I was very fortunate in life in that the team I grew up supporting, I managed to play for, captain and manage. \u2018There\u2019s not a lot of people who can say that. \u2018But my only focus now is Kilmarnock football club. I\u2019m employed here and I want to very best for them.\u2019 Be that as it may, does what happened in Gorgie getting on a year ago still rankle with him? \u2018Not at all. It\u2019s football,\u2019 Locke insisted. \u2018One of my best mates in the game, Davie Weir, is at Brentford. You see the job he\u2019s done there with Mark Warburton yet they are leaving at the end of the season. Nothing surprises you. \u2018It\u2019s a game that\u2019s great to be involved in but it can be tough, as well. I\u2019m not the type of person that feels sorry for myself. You\u2019ve got to take these things on the chin and move forward. Fortunately for me, I got a great opportunity back here and hopefully I can take it.\u2019 That new contract should be inked by the end of this week and then the building for the future can start in earnest. The 39-year-old manager admits it will be strange facing his former club Hearts next season . Finally, without the yokes of administration and the intentions of new owners, Locke is relishing the chance to lead the Rugby Park side unhindered. Diplomacy prevented him talking openly of his desire to see Kris Boyd assume a playing/coaching role next term but it\u2019s evidently part of Locke\u2019s plans. \u2018Obviously I played with Kris, he\u2019s a friend of mine and possibly because I was sitting beside him at Ibrox on Saturday, someone saw me,\u2019 he said. \u2018He\u2019s very much a Rangers player and his focus is obviously trying to get Rangers back in the top flight. \u2018It\u2019s not for me to speculate on other team\u2019s players as they have a lot of big games ahead. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be right of me to comment on Kris Boyd. I\u2019m not sure how many goals he has scored this season but he has still contributed eight or nine goals. \u2018If we had a striker contributing that, we might be in the top six. I know Boydy well and I\u2019m pretty sure that wherever he ends up next season, he will score goals because that\u2019s what he does.\u2019 The prospect of Boyd returning to Kilmarnock for a third spell will gladden the hearts of the Rugby Park faithful. The striker may have endured a poor season second time around at Rangers but, at 31, still has the capacity to ensure a return to his first club is a successful one. For Locke, too, Rugby Park has largely been a very happy second home. For all his strong Tynecastle links, it was in East Ayrshire that he spent seven years as a player. And, after being cut-adrift by Hearts last summer, it was Killie that offered him a way back into the game. You sense that\u2019s something that will never be forgotten. Locke was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park . \u2018I played at Killie for seven years and I know what they are capable of,\u2019 he added. \u2018The facilities here are fantastic. I spend a lot of time down here and I see what the club is doing in the local community. \u2018There are kids here every single night of the week, which is fantastic to see. Things are really positive. \u2018When I played here there were a lot of Celtic and Rangers strips about the town and now there are lots of Killie ones so that\u2019s encouraging in terms of the future. \u2018Hopefully, we can see a lot of these younger kids coming through like we do at the moment - we have eight academy players in the first team which is great. \u2018The club is moving forward in the right direction and hopefully it can keep moving forward.\u2019 GARY LOCKE was speaking at a Tesco Bank Football Festival at Rugby Park.

The chance to play, captain and manage the club ensured that, for long enough, the love affair was requited. A year ago, though, a long-standing relationship hit the buffers with a rather dull thud. Widely acclaimed for the way he led the club throughout administration and a season of near-certain relegation, the 39-year-old awoke one day having to digest one of the game\u2019s great truths: No one is indispensable. Gary Locke is currently manager at Kilmarnock after leaving his post at Hears last year . Locke chats with Ryan Stevenson last season . Brutally axed as Ann Budge and Craig Levein made way for Robbie Neilson, Locke licked his wounds before returning to Kilmarnock, initially as assistant manager to Allan Johnston. What\u2019s transpired since the parting of the ways has been utterly intriguing for both parties. Neilson\u2019s side romped to the Championship title with seven games to spare to mute anyone still clinging to the notion that they were wrong to dispense with Locke\u2019s services. Yet, in only losing one of seven games since taking the reins from Johnson last month at Rugby Park, Locke, in turn, has underscored his dug-out credentials and then some. Would Hearts have won the Championship title with him still at the helm? We shall never know. But, as he puts the finishing touches to a new long-term deal in Ayrshire this week, the growing feeling among observers is that his former employers were perhaps both right and wrong. \u2018I don\u2019t think I have proven a point to Hearts,\u2019 Locke insisted. \u2018I didn\u2019t feel I had anything to prove. I did a good job there. \u2018It is like any football club. When new people come in, if they have their own ideas and want to change things then that is what they will do. \u2018I am delighted to see them coming straight back up - they have some cracking young players there and it is great to see them do so well. \u2018But my focus now is Kilmarnock.

The embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible Six Nations whitewash await on Saturday. Yet, still, some have faith. After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special. The 32-year-old, who has won 60 caps during his nine-year international career, is not one to take a backwards on the field of play. And he insists that, despite results, Vern Cotter's men are heading in the right direction. Scotland lock Jim Hamilton has won 60 caps for his country spanning a nine-year international career . Ireland will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at BT Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon to apply a significant dose of pressure to Championship rivals England before they take on France in the evening kick-off. An onslaught awaits. But the man who Cotter calls his 'great, old warrior' was in no mood to take on the roll of cannon-fodder. And Hamilton, who has already experienced the pain of the wooden spoon in 2007 and 2012, said: 'I understand the results are the most important thing, but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future. 'Having had the experiences I have had playing for Scotland and not having everything going our way and having to brush ourselves off in adversity, something good will come of the time we are going through just now I am sure. 'This squad is in a very good place, more so than in most Six Nations I have been involved in despite the results. On paper, it doesn't look like we've done too well as we haven't won a game, but I think it is fair to say that we are definitely on the up. Hamilton insists Scotland are heading in the right direction under Scotland coach Vern Cotter (above) 'We have some fantastic players coming through. Jonny Gray was just 21 on Saturday. Then you have Adam Ashe, Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Fraser Brown. We are building an unbelievably good squad of players and we are playing some great stuff. 'The biggest frustration is that in the past we have been the could-have, should-have, would-have side. The nearly team. But that will change under Vern Cotter with this group of players, no question. 'I genuinely, genuinely believe in what I am doing and what he is doing otherwise I would not be working as hard as I am to be here and trying to get into the Scotland team. 'Are we better than the wooden spoon this year? Yeah, we probably are. 'If we beat Ireland at the weekend, am I going to be happy with how we did in the Championship? No. I want to win games. I'm here to win Championships. I am here to be part of a Scotland successful team that will come good soon. 'Whether that is with me starting games, on the bench or in the squad helping the great young guys, I am determined to see it through as this team is heading in the right direction under Vern Cotter. Hamilton cites young talent such as 21-year-old lock Jonny Gray as reasons for optimism going forward . 'I will stay here as long as I possibly can to help our fortunes change which they will. I genuinely believe it will happen soon and this team will do very, very well.' Hamilton's optimism is not based in fantasy. Scotland have shown glimpses of what they can do \u2014 and, at times, their play has been a joy to behold. All they have to do now is execute Cotter's game plan without making the silly mistakes that have cost them victory in at least three of their Six Nations matches thus far. 'I genuinely believe winning is a habit we have simply got out off,' said the big second row. 'Having played for Leicester and for Saracens in games where we are not playing that well but go on to win, we got used to winning. It's a habit but losing is, as well. 'We can change that habit against Ireland and although we may go into it off some losses, we have positives to take from them. Young flanker Adam Ashe (right) is another player who has shown plenty of promise in recent games . 'For example, look at the England game when we lost early points but went in at half-time winning 13-10 \u2014 which just shows the maturity in what is a young squad. 'Also we are scoring some really exciting tries with some being fantastic, haven't they? 'It is now all about bringing everything together now into a full 80-minute performance. Can we win the game against Ireland at the weekend with what we've got? Of course we can. 'We have shown enough signs that we are good enough and provided we stop making naive mistakes, we can finish the Six Nations with a win and show how well this group of players is progressing.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible six nations whitewash. he has won 60 caps during his nine-year international career. ireland take on france in the evening kick-off on saturday. jim hamilton is a team on the verge of something special. jim hamilton has won 60 caps for his country.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

(HarperCollins \u00a318.99) Tom Jones has been a genuine global star for half a century. How many other people can say that? By my reckoning, it\u2019s no more than a handful: Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood and HM The Queen. And only one of them, I believe, lives in a larger house than Sir Tom\u2019s. Sir Tom Jones (pictured in Los Angeles in 1978) had his first No 1 in the UK in March 1965 . It was in March 1965 that his first hit, It\u2019s Not Unusual, went to No 1 in the UK and made him famous. To this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. Another significant milestone approaches on June 7, when he will turn 75 years old. All of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed, no-holds-barred hardback biography. Smith\u2019s is not the first \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the twelfth. But it\u2019s the first for nearly two years, and should keep us going until the autumn, when Sir Tom\u2019s autobiography is due out. What else will the great man be able to reveal, given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made? Tom (pictured in early 1970s) married his wife Linda in 1957 when they were both only 16-years-old . For Sir Tom has not lived a particularly secretive life. Though married to Linda, nee Trenchard, for 58 years, and happily so, he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life. But as long as Linda doesn\u2019t have to read about it in the newspaper \u2014 let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t read this \u2014 she turns a blind eye. It\u2019s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it. It\u2019s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it. Such opportunities would never have arisen, of course, without the talent. Jones was born with the gift of a golden voice, and he knows exactly what to do with it. This was apparent on his first hit, and has not wavered since. Tom Jones (pictured) was born\u00a0Thomas Woodward but was persuaded to change his name by his manager\u00a0Gordon Mills, who also persuaded the star to move to London from Wales . Quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but, under the watchful eye of his son, Mark, who has managed him since the mid-Eighties, he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans. Several generations, in fact. The backstory is well known. Babies hear it on their mothers\u2019 knees, and then tell it to their own babies many years later. Born Thomas Woodward in Treforest, South Wales, the infant Tom \u2018had an edge, even as a youngster in short trousers. He didn\u2019t just sing a song; he performed it with verve and passion\u2019. Aged 12, he lost a year at school through tuberculosis; at 16, he was married with a child on the way. \u2018Most of the girls found him very attractive,\u2019 said one schoolmate. \u2018He seemed a bit rough to me, but he definitely had the charisma. He had a way with him, a swagger.\u2019 Tom Jones (right) is pictured with his manager, Gordon Mills (left), in January 1969. Mills worked as the superstar's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986 . The climb from obscurity, though, was long and arduous. Tom was a member of a band called The Senators, who weren\u2019t going anywhere terribly fast. A sharp-eyed young manager, Gordon Mills, persuaded him to move to London, change his name to \u2018Tom Jones\u2019 and begin a solo career. He was already in his mid-20s. For 20 years, until Gordon died of cancer, Tom always deferred to his expertise. In return, Gordon did all Tom\u2019s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking. It was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly. Hits in the Sixties led to Las Vegas in the Seventies, and what might best be described as the Underwear Throwing Years. No bow-tie was larger or fluffier than Tom\u2019s, no hips swivelled more suggestively. Elvis was a good friend and was convinced Tom wore a sock down the front of his trousers. Tom knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them, though he didn\u2019t like it when John Lennon, with his characteristic Scouse wit, called him a \u2018Welsh poof\u2019. Would anyone? Tom (pictured) has been a judge on the Voice UK talent show since 2012, as has will.i.am (pictured) Nonetheless, an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when Tom recorded five consecutive country albums in the early Eighties. The live tours and Vegas residencies had made him hedge-fund rich. He and Linda lived in splendour in California, with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner. But was it making him happy? Well, yes, but at the same time, Tom clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier, rootsier music he had first loved. It hasn\u2019t been an entirely easy ride since then, but his last two studio albums, Praise & Blame (2010) and Spirit In The Room (2012), have been the best of his long career. What comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man. Other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises, when they have clearly had the lot done. Sir Tom Jones has also had the lot done \u2014 but cheerfully admits to it. He has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket, yet is generous with family and close friends, as you or I would be in his position. He doesn\u2019t like drugs or gambling, but enjoys a good cigar, and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good. Sir Tom (pictured), unlike many other celebrities, has admitted to having had plastic surgery work . Smith is an efficient chronicler of the life, as befits an old pro whose previous books have included Kylie, Gary (Barlow), Alesha (Dixon), Tulisa, Kate (Middleton), Cheryl and, of course, Victoria. There are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge: Leonard Cohen\u2019s song is called Tower Of Song, not Tower Of Strength, for instance, and he doesn\u2019t know that Burt Bacharach did not write the lyrics to his songs, which is a bit poor. But his book bounces along happily enough, forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every-thing and become universally adored. As Rob Brydon put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award: \u2018Tom Jones has lived the life we would all love to live.\u2019 I have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept, and Sir Tom probably sang It\u2019s Not Unusual for about the 20,000th time.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsir tom jones had his first no 1 in the uk in 1965. it was in march 1965 that his first hit, it's not unusual. only one of them, i believe, lives in a larger house. the fame is untainted and talent uneroded. paul mccartney, bob dylan, clint eastwood and hm the queen.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

(HarperCollins \u00a318.99) Tom Jones has been a genuine global star for half a century. How many other people can say that? By my reckoning, it\u2019s no more than a handful: Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood and HM The Queen. And only one of them, I believe, lives in a larger house than Sir Tom\u2019s. Sir Tom Jones (pictured in Los Angeles in 1978) had his first No 1 in the UK in March 1965 . It was in March 1965 that his first hit, It\u2019s Not Unusual, went to No 1 in the UK and made him famous. To this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. Another significant milestone approaches on June 7, when he will turn 75 years old. All of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed, no-holds-barred hardback biography. Smith\u2019s is not the first \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the twelfth. But it\u2019s the first for nearly two years, and should keep us going until the autumn, when Sir Tom\u2019s autobiography is due out. What else will the great man be able to reveal, given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made? Tom (pictured in early 1970s) married his wife Linda in 1957 when they were both only 16-years-old . For Sir Tom has not lived a particularly secretive life. Though married to Linda, nee Trenchard, for 58 years, and happily so, he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life. But as long as Linda doesn\u2019t have to read about it in the newspaper \u2014 let\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t read this \u2014 she turns a blind eye. It\u2019s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it. It\u2019s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it. Such opportunities would never have arisen, of course, without the talent. Jones was born with the gift of a golden voice, and he knows exactly what to do with it. This was apparent on his first hit, and has not wavered since. Tom Jones (pictured) was born\u00a0Thomas Woodward but was persuaded to change his name by his manager\u00a0Gordon Mills, who also persuaded the star to move to London from Wales . Quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but, under the watchful eye of his son, Mark, who has managed him since the mid-Eighties, he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans. Several generations, in fact. The backstory is well known. Babies hear it on their mothers\u2019 knees, and then tell it to their own babies many years later. Born Thomas Woodward in Treforest, South Wales, the infant Tom \u2018had an edge, even as a youngster in short trousers. He didn\u2019t just sing a song; he performed it with verve and passion\u2019. Aged 12, he lost a year at school through tuberculosis; at 16, he was married with a child on the way. \u2018Most of the girls found him very attractive,\u2019 said one schoolmate. \u2018He seemed a bit rough to me, but he definitely had the charisma. He had a way with him, a swagger.\u2019 Tom Jones (right) is pictured with his manager, Gordon Mills (left), in January 1969. Mills worked as the superstar's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986 . The climb from obscurity, though, was long and arduous. Tom was a member of a band called The Senators, who weren\u2019t going anywhere terribly fast. A sharp-eyed young manager, Gordon Mills, persuaded him to move to London, change his name to \u2018Tom Jones\u2019 and begin a solo career. He was already in his mid-20s. For 20 years, until Gordon died of cancer, Tom always deferred to his expertise. In return, Gordon did all Tom\u2019s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking. It was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly. Hits in the Sixties led to Las Vegas in the Seventies, and what might best be described as the Underwear Throwing Years. No bow-tie was larger or fluffier than Tom\u2019s, no hips swivelled more suggestively. Elvis was a good friend and was convinced Tom wore a sock down the front of his trousers. Tom knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them, though he didn\u2019t like it when John Lennon, with his characteristic Scouse wit, called him a \u2018Welsh poof\u2019. Would anyone? Tom (pictured) has been a judge on the Voice UK talent show since 2012, as has will.i.am (pictured) Nonetheless, an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when Tom recorded five consecutive country albums in the early Eighties. The live tours and Vegas residencies had made him hedge-fund rich. He and Linda lived in splendour in California, with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner. But was it making him happy? Well, yes, but at the same time, Tom clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier, rootsier music he had first loved. It hasn\u2019t been an entirely easy ride since then, but his last two studio albums, Praise & Blame (2010) and Spirit In The Room (2012), have been the best of his long career. What comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man. Other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises, when they have clearly had the lot done. Sir Tom Jones has also had the lot done \u2014 but cheerfully admits to it. He has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket, yet is generous with family and close friends, as you or I would be in his position. He doesn\u2019t like drugs or gambling, but enjoys a good cigar, and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good. Sir Tom (pictured), unlike many other celebrities, has admitted to having had plastic surgery work . Smith is an efficient chronicler of the life, as befits an old pro whose previous books have included Kylie, Gary (Barlow), Alesha (Dixon), Tulisa, Kate (Middleton), Cheryl and, of course, Victoria. There are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge: Leonard Cohen\u2019s song is called Tower Of Song, not Tower Of Strength, for instance, and he doesn\u2019t know that Burt Bacharach did not write the lyrics to his songs, which is a bit poor. But his book bounces along happily enough, forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every-thing and become universally adored. As Rob Brydon put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award: \u2018Tom Jones has lived the life we would all love to live.\u2019 I have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept, and Sir Tom probably sang It\u2019s Not Unusual for about the 20,000th time.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nsir tom jones had his first no 1 in the uk in 1965. it was in march 1965 that his first hit, it's not unusual. only one believe, lives in a larger house than sir tom's. the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. paul mccartney, bob dylan, clint eastwood and hm the queen.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The student is suing the Davis County School District for $674,000 for emotional damage he says he suffered as a result of the affair, which happened when he was 17, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. His former teacher, 35-year-old Brianne Altice, has been charged with 14 felonies - including rape, sodomy and sex abuse - for allegedly having sexual relationships with three different students. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on \u00a0bail for charges relating to the first two students. Her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars. Not happy: A student who says he had sex with his teacher, Brianne Altice, is now suing the school district. Altice is pictured in court last month after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied . The student who has brought the lawsuit accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claims they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He claims that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. School district spokesman Chris Williams said he was unaware of the lawsuit. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. Locked up: Altice, pictured in court in January, had her bond revoked earlier this year after it emerged she allegedly had sex with a third student while out on bail for having sex with two other students . In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal. Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . Brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in October 2013 to interview her. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' Last month, she requested to drop one of the charges, claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys. But a judge denied the motion.

It is not the first new species to be named after characters from the Star Wars films. Even though taxonomy is considered to be a serious business, those naming new species often have a lot of fun with the names. In 2012 marine biologists named a purple deep sea worm Yoda purpurata after the Jedi knight from Star Wars - Yoda.

Peckoltia greedoi (shown above) has bug-eyes, bristles on its cheeks and a large sucker mouth . There is also a small parasite that lives on a burrowing crab known as Albunione yoda. A fossil trilobite which was found to belong to a new genus was given the name Han solo by a palaeobiologist Samuel Turvey. Jason Bong, director of the Auburn University Museum of Natural Hisotry also named a new species of trapdoor spider the Aptostichus sarlaac, after the sarlacc monster that appears in the Return of the Jedi. A species of ant in Madagascar is called Tetramorium jedi, while an entire genus of mite in Australia is called Darthvaderum. There are also three species of wasp called Polemistus chewbacca, Polemistus vaderi and Polemistus yoda. Professor Armbuster himself has named more than 40 new species of fish. Peckoltia greedoi was first discovered in 1998 but had not been described as a new species until this year.

Again, though, manager Chris Ramsey defended his players' application and, in particular, Rio Ferdinand. The former England international was culpable for both goals, leading to chants from the away end of 'It's time to retire' - something a smattering of home fans joined in with. 'I think Rio's applied himself well,' Ramsey said. 'I'm very pleased with the way he played. 'In the position we're in, when goals go in people will always get blamed or people look at some more than others. 'For Rio to be the age he is and applying himself the way he is in training and in games, we need to encourage him. 'It's always disappointing when a goal goes in, and you can always break it down and analyse it to its finest points. The players involved will always be disappointed.'

Giorgio Armani gave us a lesson in luxury by creating what Vogue are dubbing the 'skouser' - a wrap-around skirt-cum-pair of slim-fitting trousers made from one piece of material, which were paired with fur jackets and blouses. Elsewhere on the catwalk were the classic tuxedos that Armani does so well, as well as sequin jackets and even more fringed ponchos. He also showcased strapless dresses with ruched bust lines that looked eerily like curtain pelmets or bed skirts. Yet as he celebrates 40 years of his brand this year, Armani proved he's still a byword for mature elegance.

The flamboyant duo - who are known for drawing on long-held ideas and imagery of Italian womanhood, whether it's the sensual town vamp or a black-clad nonna - sent models on to the catwalk with children as accessories, walking to the beat of Spice Girl's Nineties hit, Mama. There were toddlers and babies all dressed in the Italian house's sumptuous silks and luxurious lace. Called the Viva La Mamma show, other motifs running through the collection were the deep red, almost Gothic, roses (traditionally given on Mother's Day in Italy), vintage brooches, midi dresses, black lace and corsetry.

Models wore their hair back but parted in the centre, in the style of chic 1940s Italian women, and their lips matched the crimson rose embroidery. However, Salvatore Ferragamo's collection had a more restrained Sixties feel with a brown, beige and maroon palette and graphic prints on the catwalk - as well as the dresses. Dresses, skirts and knits were covered in vertical  panels and the geometry theme carried through to most of the looks.

The low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $69 round-trip fares in April and May that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply. Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act. \"We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,\" reads the offer on Spirit's website. \"It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.\" Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. \"You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked,\" wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis. Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture. \"Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. We enjoy being different than other airlines,\" said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications. \"When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.  But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. They get lots of attention,\" he added. \"The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently.\" The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday. Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights. Based in Florida, Spirit Airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can. The airline's defense is simple: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want. Airline plans $15 flights to Europe .\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nspirit airlines has new fare deal with sex jokes. the low-cost carrier is celebrating with $ 69 round-trip fares in april. observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay for a one-way flight.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder. Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering. For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger. Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) slides home a late winner to give Swansea City a 1-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon .

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy. This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with \u00a328million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot. Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected to plant a firm shot past Brad Guzan.

'There comes a time in a game when if you're looking like not winning it you make sure you don't lose it. We have to try and address that.' It was a close match. Swansea bossed the first half, Villa shaded the second. In the 57th minute Gabby Agbonlahor thought he had scored when Christian Benteke's header fell his way four yards out. But Neil Taylor blocked brilliantly. Scott Sinclair and Fabian Delph both sent good openings wide and Sinclair almost found an equaliser in added time when volleying inches over the bar. By now Benteke had gone off because of a niggling hip problem and Swansea could have extended their winning margin when Routledge ran free close to the end. But Guzan saved well. In the first half the American goalkeeper twice denied Gomis, who should have scored from Taylor's cross on six minutes. He also had a great chance 16 minutes from time after Monetro's ball but Clark diverted the shot away. Gomis was not to be denied, leaving Garry Monk delighted.

They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder. Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering. For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger.

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy. This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with \u00a328million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot. Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected to plant a firm shot past Brad Guzan. Sherwood, who saw his side lose to Stoke in injury time of his Villa debut, was in terse mood afterwards. Defeat hurts him deeply.

Sherwood yells out instructions to his Villa charges as they try to break the deadlock against Garry Monk's men . 'That's the second time it's happened now,' he said. 'There comes a time in a game when if you're looking like not winning it you make sure you don't lose it. We have to try and address that.' It was a close match. Swansea bossed the first half, Villa shaded the second. In the 57th minute Gabby Agbonlahor thought he had scored when Christian Benteke's header fell his way four yards out. But Neil Taylor blocked brilliantly. Scott Sinclair and Fabian Delph both sent good openings wide and Sinclair almost found an equaliser in added time when volleying inches over the bar. By now Benteke had gone off because of a niggling hip problem and Swansea could have extended their winning margin when Routledge ran free close to the end. But Guzan saved well. In the first half the American goalkeeper twice denied Gomis, who should have scored from Taylor's cross on six minutes. He also had a great chance 16 minutes from time after Monetro's ball but Clark diverted the shot away. Gomis was not to be denied, leaving Garry Monk delighted.
