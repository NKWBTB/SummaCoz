The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.\n\"A successful industry,\" the report says, \"therefore needs continued market access.\"\nHowever, that access may come at a price.\n\"Brexit will involve many trade-offs,\" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.\n\"It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.\"\nThe report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.\nOne area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away \"raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes\" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nHowever, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.\nJust this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.\nResponding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.\n\"With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,\" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.\n\"This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.\"\nIn response to the report, a government spokesperson said: \"As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.\"\n\"At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe uk\\'s fishing industry risks losing access to the european union after brexit, a house of lords report says.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.\n\"We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,\" explained Ms Gardent.\n\"Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.\"\nThe only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.\nBy 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.\nSince then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.\nThis represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.\n\"The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,\" Ms Gardent emphasised.\n\"We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.\"\nThe northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.\nEfforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.\nAt this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\na study of glaciers in the french alps suggests that the glaciers of the french alps continue to retreat.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Croft Solicitors is representing the expats.\nSuperstar of the bar\" Lord Pannick QC - also an independent member of the House of Lords - will be arguing Gina Miller's case while the government is turning to an old favourite, James Eadie QC.\nAttorney General Jeremy Wright QC, the government's legal adviser, will also play a big role.\nHe said: \"There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to re-join it through the back door, and no second referendum.\n\"We do not believe this case has legal merit. The result should be respected and the government intends to do just that.\"\nIn political terms, the UK is on course for departure from the EU. But as far as the law goes, nothing has changed.\nThe UK remains a fully paid-up member of the EU until it triggers Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.\nThe question at the heart of the row is: who should activate Article 50? The prime minister or Parliament?\nDuring the referendum campaign, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said that in the event of a Leave vote he would activate Article 50 immediately. The government maintains that his successor Theresa May has the authority to do so, without a vote by MPs.\nThat right - they say - is based on the Royal Prerogative - powers once held by kings and queens to do, essentially, what they wished.\nThe use of prerogative powers in a modern parliamentary democracy is a curious corner of British law.\nOver centuries, power in the UK has been wrested away from dictatorial monarchs and handed to elected politicians.\nBut government ministers have managed to cling on to a few of those regal powers, usually in international affairs.\nOne such prerogative is the power to make and break treaties with other countries.\nThe government's position is that triggering Article 50 is all about ending a treaty with other EU countries and so using prerogative powers in these circumstances is \"entirely consistent with standard constitutional practice\".\nCritics will argue in the High Court that it is a bit more complicated than that.\nThey say that activating Article 50 effectively wipes out the European Communities Act 1972, passed by Parliament and allowing EU law to apply in the UK.\nLawyers opposing the government argue that the 1972 Act introduced a big constitutional change and gave British people new rights.\nIt would be unlawful, they conclude, for a prime minister to use the Royal Prerogative to take away rights bestowed by Parliament.\nGrahame Pigney, from the People's Challenge, says the \"enforced removal\" of citizenship rights from 65 million people would be \"completely unprecedented\" in a modern democracy.\n\"I believe that, as Parliament has granted us these rights, it is for Parliament to decide when, how and under what circumstances they are taken away,\" he says.\nLawyers working for Fair Deal for Expats will be deploying similar legal arguments but using evidence to emphasise the human impact of Brexit.\nThe chairman of Fair Deal for Expats, John Shaw - who lives in France - has submitted a statement to the High Court saying the referendum result was a \"shock\".\nHe is currently undergoing cancer treatment in France.\nHe states: \"If my right to access healthcare is either taken away, or compromised materially such that I am not able to rely upon it in the same way as French nationals, I would be unlikely to receive, or be able to afford, the same level of care in France.\"\nHis lawyers will tell the High Court that the rights enjoyed by British citizens \"beyond these shores\" are so fundamental that legislation is \"required\" to take them away.\nBut in legal papers setting out the government's case - released last week - it insists that starting the withdrawal process will not have any impact on British laws and any changes will be decided in future negotiations.\nThe Royal Prerogative is just one of the arguments to be aired in the High Court.\nThere will be heated debates about the 2015 European Union Referendum Act, which paved the way for a referendum.\nIn their legal papers the government states that Parliament passed that Act on the \"clear understanding\" that the outcome of the referendum would be \"respected\".\nIf Gina Miller wins the case - it adds - it will not be able to \"give effect to the will and decision of the people\".\nConservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, and prominent Leave campaigner Sir Bill Cash thinks the government has a strong case, saying: \"To attempt to revisit the decision by another Act of Parliament is a kind of fraud on the electorate.\"\nBut lawyers at Mishcon de Reya say the idea was to set up an \"advisory\" referendum - not a binding one.\nThey state: \"Nowhere in the 2015 Act does it specify the consequences that should follow from the referendum result.\"\nThe biggest weapon in the government's armoury could be that the whole issue is not a matter for the UK courts at all.\nThey says it is a complex decision that must be made by ministers.\nSir Bill Cash said: \"We could have a situation where judges are imposing a requirement on Parliament, via the secretary of state, to make legislation.\n\"That's outside the rules. The proceedings of parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court.\"\nLord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, will hear the case - which is expected to last a couple of weeks.\nMark Elliott says it is very hard to know which way it will go.\n\"If the court simply applied existing case law, the government would win. The question is whether the court will go beyond existing territory and treat it as an exceptional situation. The court may develop the law.\"\nPutting the legal arguments aside, some Brexit supporters say that the High Court case is a fig-leaf for a political campaign to keep the UK inside the EU.\nGina Miller disputes that and argues that Leavers and Remainers should back her case against \"prerogative creep\".\n\"The idea that a court case can put a halt to Brexit is nonsense and it has nothing to do with altering the timetable. What we are looking for is legal certainty.\"\nIf the court concludes that Parliament must approve Article 50, that could be a game-changer.\nThe majority of MPs campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU. They could, in theory, vote against the activation of Article 50.\nBut would they risk enormous political and social ructions by rejecting the referendum result?\nMost members of the House of Lords are also opposed to Brexit. That raises the possibility of another extraordinary scenario - an unelected Lords voting against the wishes of 17.4 million people.\nIf the government loses its case in the British courts, they could eventually go to the European Court of Justice.\nIt raises the possibility of a truly strange scenario - Brexit ministers asking European judges to overturn the decision of the British courts.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nit\\'s a legal challenge to the legal status of expats who want to leave the european union.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1. The article states that Gina Miller, a hairdresser and investment manager, is leading a legal challenge against the government's decision to trigger Article 50 without a vote in Parliament.\n2. The claim is that the government does not have the power to trigger Article 50 without Parliament's approval, as it would be taking away rights granted by Parliament to British citizens.\n3. The legal challenge also argues that the 2015 European Union Referendum Act did not specify the consequences of the referendum result, and therefore, the government cannot use the Royal Prerogative to trigger Article 50 without Parliament's approval.\n4. The case is expected to go to the High Court and could potentially be taken to the European Court of Justice if the government loses.\n\nTherefore, the claim is that the legal challenge is a fight against the government's decision to trigger Article 50 without Parliament's approval, and it is not a legal challenge to the legal status of expats who want to leave the European Union."}]

I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.\nHe graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece.\nThe following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.\nI appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then.\nAfterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?\nBut today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.\nOne example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.\nCompare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.\nThis 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.\nMy point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.\nOf course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.\nSo, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.\nOther firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence.

Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.\nAndrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.\n\"The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.\"\nHe said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women \"were more straightforward and tell their friends\".\n\"Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,\" Prof Oswald added.\n\"It could be that Australia is odd.

The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.\n\"A successful industry,\" the report says, \"therefore needs continued market access.\"\nHowever, that access may come at a price.\n\"Brexit will involve many trade-offs,\" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.\n\"It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.\"\nThe report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.\nOne area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away \"raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes\" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nHowever, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.\nJust this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.\nResponding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.\n\"With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,\" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.\n\"This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.\"\nIn response to the report, a government spokesperson said: \"As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.\"\n\"At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe uk fishing industry will need continued access to eu markets if it is to thrive after brexit, a house of lords report has warned.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers.\nThe best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International.\nAll three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups.\nThe most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin.\nMost recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions.\n\"I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook.\nVolunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine.\nThe Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\n\"DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests.\nTo disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.\nThe Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware.\nOn 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSome media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire.\nBut officials deny this. \"We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.\nOn the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.\nThe group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.\nDuring US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\"\nCyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.\nAnother stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.\nThey also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.\nIn addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\nThe claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.\nRussian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\".\nWhat is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.\nThe group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.\nIn  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.\nAnd in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.\nAccess to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.\nThat means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.\nThe idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.\nThe boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.\n\"Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.\n\"Here, we\u2019ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,\" he told BBC News.\nAirbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.\nThe most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the \"revolution\" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.\nThe first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.\nAnother batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.\nThe establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.\nMore than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.\nThere should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.\nOneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.\nEquity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a \"truly global company\" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.\n\"A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,\" said OneWeb CEO Eric B\u00e9ranger.\n\"And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.\"\nOne aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.\nThe fear is that space could eventually become unusable.\nA recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.\nBrian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.\n\"We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.\"\nTime will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.\nAirbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.\n\"Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,\u201d said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\neuropean aerospace giant airbus and its partner, oneweb, have begun the production of a satellite mega-constellation.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.\nBy contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.\nWhilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.\nStonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. \"To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence.\"\nBut Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.\"\nA one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.\nNHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.\nThe hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.\nIf you want more detail about the reasoning behind the decision to lift the ban, then the full report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) can be read here.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nit\\'s been a year for men who have sex with a man who had sex with a man.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long.

A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.\nIt's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.\nMany Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

The figure would stand at \u00a34.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said.\nMr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.\n\"Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads.\n\"That seems fairer to me,\" he added.\nThe think tank also said the move would be \"extremely popular\" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority.\n'Dramatic erosion'\nCritics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos.\nThe National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be \"cleansed\" of \"hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices\".\nLabour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor.\nMs Buck also argued that the Labour government's \u00a38bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power.\nHousing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced \"radical reforms\" to \"get Britain building\" and to reduce social housing waiting lists.\nThey included investing \u00a319.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme \"set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes\".\nCouncils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure \"social housing goes to those in greatest need\", he added.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe housing and housing associations are ``something they should look at low wages\\'\\', a think tank has suggested.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal.\nBut all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold.\nMalcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade.\nIf there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%.\nHe calculates that defence would require another \u00a325bn over the next five years to stay above 2%.\nThe military top brass know that is not going to happen.\nTheir planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget.\nSpending 2% is not mandatory to Nato membership.\nFew states do, but it is totemic.\nThe US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment, especially when David Cameron recently lectured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales.\nIn US eyes, the UK's credibility will inevitably suffer if, as seems likely, it fails to meet the 2% target.\nIt is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence.\nThe question is by how much?\nOver the lifetime of the last parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cut its budget by about 8%.\nWith the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit, there will have to be more savings in public spending.\nNone of these three parties say they would ring-fence or protect defence, like the NHS or overseas aid.\nThe MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-protected budget, after welfare, of \u00a334bn a year.\nAnother Conservative-led government plans to make savings of around \u00a312bn a year.\nShared across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another  \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn of its annual budget.\nBut Michael Clark, director of defence think tank Rusi, says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts, in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign.\nThe Conservatives also appear to have limited their options.\nThey are promising to replace Trident, to increase the defence equipment budget by 1% a year, and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army.\nMr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find \"significant savings\" in defence.\nBut without raiding the MoD's coffers, he says, the Conservatives' entire fiscal plans would \"go out of the window\".\nLabour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments.\nMilitary chiefs, though, are still worried.\nGen Sir Richard Shirreff, who was the second most senior military commander at Nato, says: \" I fear it's almost certain that there will be more cuts.\"\nThe Conservatives and UKIP are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement.\nThat means building four new submarines at an estimated cost of at least \u00a320bn.\nAccording to the MoD's own figures, about one quarter of committed defence equipment spending over the next decade will be on the successor submarines and deterrent systems.\nSo it is an obvious area to look for savings.\nLabour say they would continue the round-the-clock patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), but will look at whether that can be done with three rather than four submarines.\nThe Liberal Democrats say they would retain a nuclear deterrent, but end CASD - what has been dubbed a \"part-time deterrent\".\nThe SNP and the Greens would scrap it altogether.\nThere is no political consensus.\nJames de Waal, who worked in the MoD on the last Strategic Defence Review says: \"Trident might be up for grabs.\"\nIt is worth remembering the Tories went into the last election committed to renewing Trident, but as part of the coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, postponed the decision.\nWhat is to prevent another review and another delay, especially if a party like the SNP holds the balance of power?\nPaul Ingram, who heads the British American Security Information Council, says the nuclear programme will have to be included in the next Strategic Defence Review, due after the election.\nNot least because he says the US will find it hard to stomach a key ally spending all that money on the nuclear programme, if it means contemplating further cuts to the UK's conventional forces.\nBy the end of this decade, after a gap of 10 years, the UK will have two new operational aircraft carriers.\nThe Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.\nThey should be a symbol of power and of global ambition.\nBut there is a danger that they will be more like the emperor's new clothes.\nOn current manning levels, the Royal Navy will struggle to crew both carriers, even if as planned only one of them is operational at any given time.\nPlans to equip them with the new F-35 jet, have already had to be scaled down.\nThere is space on board for 36 F-35s, but current plans are to sail with just 12.\nThe current chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton, has already warned of the dangers of a \"hollow force\" with \"exquisite equipment\" but not enough people.\nPoliticians have long boasted that in military terms Britain can punch above its weight on the world stage.\nBut it's becoming harder to live up to that rhetoric.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nbritain\\'s defence secretary, philip hammond, has been talking about the challenges facing the country.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The German U-boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves.\nU33's commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew, who live in cramped conditions, are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships.\nTheir task, for this exercise, is to try to take out the command ship, the USS Vicksburg, and an oil tanker.\nWhen they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships, including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland, to begin the search.\nHe says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity.\nThere have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden, Finland and the UK.\nHe says the training \"focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it's not theoretical that we might have to do anti-submarine warfare\".\nFor the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy.\nIt has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack.\nUp on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg, the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope.\nDown below, in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship, sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors.\nLieutenant Colin Ryan, Vicksburg's anti-submarine warfare officer, admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship.\nHe says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines.\nBut when I ask whether they have been Russian, he replies nervously: \"I wouldn't want to comment on that,\" before adding: \"In general, we're always on the lookout.\"\nNato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines, let alone the movements of any potential enemy.\nBut this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia's increasing military strength.\nWhile many European nations have been cutting their defence budgets and the capabilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been heavily investing in his.\nRussia now has a fleet of around 60 submarines - the larger nuclear powered ones and smaller diesel electric submarines which can operate in shallow waters.\nEarlier this month Russia launched what it claims is the \"quietest submarine in the world\".\nPeter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer, and now a senior fellow at the defence think tank RUSI, says it now leads the world in submarine development.\nHe describes them as technologically advanced and their crews as highly skilled.\nThey are, he says, the \"quietest and most challenging adversary in the world\".\nWhen out on patrol they can go undetected for months at a time.\nOften the first time a Nato warship will be aware of their presence is when a periscope briefly pops above the waves.\nThey lie silent and stationary at the bottom of the ocean listening to and \"fingerprinting\" other nations' submarines and warships.\nFor this exercise, curiously named \"Dynamic Mongoose\", as well as the warships there are anti-submarine warfare helicopters helping in the search.\nFor the first time, a Nato research vessel has also deployed underwater unmanned vehicles or drones to help track the ocean.\nScientists on board listen to the familiar pings as the two robots shaped like torpedoes scan the seabed.\nIt is not always easy to distinguish between the shipwrecks, whales, fish shoals and rocky outcrops in the sea.\nRyan Goldhahn, scientist-in-charge at Nato's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation, says the underwater robots, which appear on their monitors as Harpo and Groucho, have several advantages to the warships and aircraft involved in the exercise.\nThey are cheaper to operate, take the person out of harm's way and can offer persistent surveillance.\nUnderwater drones are for the future.\nBut for now one of the most important assets in any nation's armoury to conduct anti-submarine warfare is the long-range maritime patrol aircraft.\nThese are able to fly long distances while scanning hundreds of miles beneath the ocean.\nFor this exercise, the top cover is being provided by a French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft.\nInside in a darkened cabin, half a dozen crew stare at the monitors that can help pinpoint submarines below.\nBritain no longer has any of its own maritime patrol aircraft and this exercise is a reminder of a significant gap in the UK's defences.\nSeveral times over the past year Britain has had to call on its Nato allies to provide eyes in the sky when there have been reported Russian submarines in or near Britain's waters.\nRUSI's Mr Roberts says it is a \"key vulnerability\".\nHe says the lack of any maritime patrol aircraft, that used to be provided by the Nimrod, means a Russian submarine could sit off the UK and track the nuclear deterrent as it leaves Faslane naval base in Scotland.\nBritain, he says, should be \"exceptionally worried\" that it is seen as a \"soft touch\", because Russia will continue to test its defences, just as they have by flying long range bombers near UK airspace.\nThe purpose of this exercise is to ensure Nato is ready to conduct anti-submarine warfare.\nBut it is also a reminder that some nations - including Britain - cannot do it alone.\nThe lack of any UK maritime patrol aircraft will have to be addressed in the government's forthcoming defence and security review.\nThe search for Russian submarines will not be as easy as the hunt for U33.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe russian navy\\'s new submarine fleet has come into effect in finland.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nIn his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds.\nIt is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid.\nBack then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge.\nThey are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four.\nIf they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.\nBut not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick.\nPart of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault.\nWhere he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front.\nBetween them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season.\nWith Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.\nBut he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system.\nLooking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough.\nIt is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team.\nThat means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes.\nDoing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight.\nIn their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games.\nThey look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault.\nWhen I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield.\nAgain, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once.\nAnother problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team.\nMore than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically.\nSadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem.\nLiverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.\nFrom Mamadou Sakho for \u00a318m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for \u00a320m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer.\nThey still look all over the place at the back.\nStatistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better.\nLiverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.\nWhat Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.\nSimon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box.\nRodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea.\nHe was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it.\nLiverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.\nNow he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays.\nMy team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini.\nFor me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu.\nIt is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough.\nIt is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet\nHe was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season.\nAlthough he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea.\nTo compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack.\nWhether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back.\nThat way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks.\nGoing forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed.\nThe trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli.\nHe will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy.\nEven if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment.\nJose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either.\nThe only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric.\nThe Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points.\nThere is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans.\nWhatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.\nHe was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future.\nPlaying in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club.\nThe older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one.\nAt 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle.\nWhat he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively.\nBecause, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that \"his legs have gone\".\nOf course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test.\nWhat happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside\nBut it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation.\nAs you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone.\nThere is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't.\nI knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them.\nWhat does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself.\nI knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer.\nFor me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too. Along with Sterling and Sturridge he is still one of Liverpool's most important players.\nOf all the players I faced in my career, he was the one I would have loved to have played with.\nHe was a nightmare to play against because he had everything. At his peak he was the best midfielder the Premier League has seen.\nSaturday will be a difficult occasion for him because what happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed him on the inside.\nOf course he will be thinking about it before the game - he must think about it all the time - but he has not let it stop him.\nIt would have been easy for him to quit after a disappointment like that, but he has kept going like he always does.\nIt is that kind of desire that will keep him going beyond the end of this season too.\nRobbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nliverpool\\'s pursuit of a premier league title could be over, according to former liverpool striker steven gerrard.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.\nNo more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.\nSir Peter said: \"Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.\n\"Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.\n\"England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.\"\nTeresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: \"Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.\n\"The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.\n\"The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.\"\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.\n\"Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers.

The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nThe Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\".\nIsrael rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.\nMr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.\nThe Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot.\nBut on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed.\nMr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech.\n\"It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel,\" he said.\n\"We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict.\"\nMr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as \"misleading critiques\" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government.\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution \"paves the way\" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January.\n\"We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation,\" he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe us has vetoed a un resolution against israel\\'s prime minister benjamin netanyahu, accusing him of violating a un security law.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1. The article states that the US did not veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction in Israel. In fact, the US abstained from voting on the resolution, allowing it to pass.\n2. The article does not mention any accusations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or any violations of UN security laws.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the US vetoed a UN resolution against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not supported by the article."}]

Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. \"You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,\" he told me.\nCritics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.\nSome have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - \"delusional diplomacy\", the Washington Post called it.\nMr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.\nSyrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.\nA statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.\nThe rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.\nAs operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.\nThe White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.\nBuses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.\nThe buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.\nThe chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: \"A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.\"\n\"This corridor is 21km long,\" he said, adding, \"6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.\"\nTurkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.\nIn a televised address, he said Turkey would take \"children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions\".\nThe head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.\nUN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.\n\"If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,\" he told reporters in Paris.\nThe 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.\nAleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.\nRussian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.\nIn October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be \"the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists\", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.\nHe singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.\nIdlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer.
