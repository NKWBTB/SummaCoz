The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.\"A successful industry,\" the report says, \"therefore needs continued market access.\"However, that access may come at a price.\"Brexit will involve many trade-offs,\" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.\"It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.\"The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away \"raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes\" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.\"With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,\" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.\"This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.\"In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: \"As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.\"\"At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.\"Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nthe uk\\'s fishing industry risks losing access to the european union after brexit, a house of lords report says.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.Sir Peter said: \"Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees.\"Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice.\"England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs.\"Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: \"Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do.\"The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved.\"The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved.\"A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers.\"Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers.

This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.\"To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,\" he said about whether he would extend his stay.\"No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.\"Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.\"Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of \"tension\" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete.

In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.In order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.The film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will \"help the public understand a little more about autism\".The film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.Alzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.Virtual meatballsVirtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.In April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.Gamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, \"not a typical Ikea customer\" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.\"In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,\" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.\"And what they wanted was meatball,\" she said.Meatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.When meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: \"I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.\"\"This is really talking to customers,\" said Ms Franov.Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.Healthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.Surgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.Now the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately \"democratise medicine\".Meanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.In one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.In September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.The kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they \"were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me\".Marcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language.Users can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall.Mr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning.\"We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there,\" he said.It is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films.\"It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,\" he said.At VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.\"One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,\" he said.Cash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nvirtual reality ( vr ) is often used to understand people who have autism.\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers. On her YouTube profile she writes:  'I use make-up to transform myself into famous celebrities and characters. 'It started out as a hobby 4 years ago and now I am here using this awesome platform to teach and entertain millions around the world.' Promise colours her lips in before adding a Mac lipstick on top - the make-up brand created a collection inspired by the film Promise uses a pair of tweezers to place false eyelashes onto her eyelid Her Facebook page states: 'I am not a professional make-up artist nor did take any lessons in it. I am purely self taught!' Along with Disney princesses, she's also transformed herself into the likes of Drake, Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson. In the four minute video Promise talks her viewers through the steps that she took to get her Maleficent look.

His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory \u2013 or a loss \u2013 could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.' Carver was also assistant manager to Alan Pardew, who lost four successive games against Sunderland\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\njohn carver was assistant to ruud gullit when he left out alan shearer and duncan ferguson . gullit controversially decided not to start star players duncan ferguson and alan shearer in 1999 . carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season .\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington,\u00a0Washington County, Utah The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing\u00a0Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda,\u00a0Humboldt County Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail.

While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since.

But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington,\u00a0Washington County, Utah The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing\u00a0Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda,\u00a0Humboldt County Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow\u00a0town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.'

Boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee. Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects. Scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee Professor James Marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made 'tremendous advances' The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex. One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions. 'Bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling,' Professor James Marshall reportedly told the BBC. 'If we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance.' Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see. To do this they mapped out the  brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain, Discovery Magazine reported. The software is then uploaded into the drone's circuitry which enables it to  fly around in a similar fashion to the bee. The projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot, each with unique abilities and configurations. Tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the University of Sheffield. In a video footage showing initial tests the drone, powered by the artificial bee brain, can be seen flying down a corridor.

The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges. According to Montgomery County police, the 26-year-old, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, fled the US after confessing to the crimes. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the Bethesda resident. According to a press release put out by the Montgomery County police Friday, in December 2014, the agency was tipped off by colleagues in South Dakota that a Maryland resident was uploading child pornography. Vile acts: Police have recovered videos showing the martial arts teacher (far right) molesting boys at the On The Mat Sports International in Chevy Chase, formerly known as DC Martial Arts Fugitive: The Tbilisi, Georgia, native admitted to trading child pornography videos earlier this month. Two days after his interview with police, he fled, possibly returning to his native country Armed with court orders, detectives in Maryland were able to obtain subscription information corresponding to the suspect, which led them to Soumbadze. On April 1, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Soumbadze\u2019s home in Bethesda, seizing several electronic devices that yielded eight pornographic videos featuring children. Other recordings recovered by police allegedly showed the suspect molesting boys at his karate studio on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase.

The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges. According to Montgomery County police, the 26-year-old, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, fled the US after confessing to the crimes. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the Bethesda resident. According to a press release put out by the Montgomery County police Friday, in December 2014, the agency was tipped off by colleagues in South Dakota that a Maryland resident was uploading child pornography. Vile acts: Police have recovered videos showing the martial arts teacher (far right) molesting boys at the On The Mat Sports International in Chevy Chase, formerly known as DC Martial Arts Fugitive: The Tbilisi, Georgia, native admitted to trading child pornography videos earlier this month. Two days after his interview with police, he fled, possibly returning to his native country Armed with court orders, detectives in Maryland were able to obtain subscription information corresponding to the suspect, which led them to Soumbadze. On April 1, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Soumbadze\u2019s home in Bethesda, seizing several electronic devices that yielded eight pornographic videos featuring children. Other recordings recovered by police allegedly showed the suspect molesting boys at his karate studio on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase. Soumbadze has been affiliated with the On The Mat Sports International karate studio, formerly known as DC Martial Arts, since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student.

People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra \u00a32,100 a year \u2013 \u00a317,800 rather than \u00a315,700 \u2013 to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages \u00a322,100, Prudential\u2019s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that \u00a39,500 \u2013 the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday\u2019s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse\u2019s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce \u2013 usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse \u2013 does not fade away even as old age approaches.

An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday \u2018I\u2019d be over the moon to get it as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked hard towards,\u2019 said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. \u2018I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I\u2019m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. \u2018But I\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. \u2018That\u2019s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s the manager who gets the stick. \u2018I\u2019ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can\u2019t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.\u2019 Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: \u2018(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. \u2018You can\u2019t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can\u2019t thank all of these people enough.\u2019 Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the \u00a3150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. \u2018When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don\u2019t foresee any problems,\u2019 he said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nA new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age.

The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age.

Iraqi officials said Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri had died in fighting with government troops in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad. Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup.\u00a0Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\n(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\n`` i 'm on television and you 're in a f**king trailer , honey , '' and `` i would n't work at a scumbag place like this .

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.'

She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.'

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.'

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\n(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8\u00bd minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\ndon mclean 's pop masterpiece `` american pie '' is 44 years old . christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . mclean was a paperboy when , on february 3 , 1959 , he saw that buddy valens and j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson had been tragically killed .\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an\u00a0in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests\u00a0for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to\u00a030 flight attendants from four different continents Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing.

The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info.

Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: \u2018When England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no.\u2019 The early bookies\u2019 favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test:\u00a0South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he\u2019d be interested in the post \u2013 created by the ECB\u2019s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton\u2019s demise Wednesday evening \u2013 Stewart said: \u2018I can\u2019t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you\u2019d be stupid not to look at it. \u2018As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it\u2019s the right role, of course I\u2019d listen and have a big conversation \u2013 once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I\u2019m under contract here. \u2018I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I\u2019d look at it. \u2018I\u2019ve got a big job here, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concentrating on. But at the same time you\u2019ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no. \u2018If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I\u2019d have thought I\u2019d be very close to being at the top of that list.\u2019 Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa But Stewart made clear he\u2019d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. \u2018If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don\u2019t do well, you get moved on. To me, it\u2019s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. \u2018I\u2019m not one for hiding. It\u2019s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.\u2019 Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton \u2013 who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level \u2018We\u2019ve never had a problem with him,\u2019 said Stewart. \u2018I\u2019m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don\u2019t have to handle him. \u2018He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he\u2019d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him. And that\u2019s how I judge people, is how I find them \u2013 not hearsay, or from other people. \u2018England have said he\u2019s not on their radar. But you should never say never. If he\u2019s racking the runs up, and England are struggling, if the players aren\u2019t getting runs or there\u2019s an injury to a batsman, and he\u2019s in top form \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you want to bring him back?\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nalec stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new director of england cricket following the sacking of paul downton . the early bookies ' favourite for the post is michael vaughan . stewart played in a record 133 tests for england and is currently director of cricket at surrey .\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: \u2018When England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no.\u2019 The early bookies\u2019 favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test:\u00a0South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he\u2019d be interested in the post \u2013 created by the ECB\u2019s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton\u2019s demise Wednesday evening \u2013 Stewart said: \u2018I can\u2019t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you\u2019d be stupid not to look at it. \u2018As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it\u2019s the right role, of course I\u2019d listen and have a big conversation \u2013 once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I\u2019m under contract here. \u2018I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I\u2019d look at it. \u2018I\u2019ve got a big job here, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concentrating on. But at the same time you\u2019ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no. \u2018If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I\u2019d have thought I\u2019d be very close to being at the top of that list.\u2019 Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England.

Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that\u00a025 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo \u00a0claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado.

The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe.

The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe.

Jerry Brown ordered mandatory, statewide water cutbacks by cities and towns, aiming for a 25 percent cut in water use. Extreme drought conditions also spread into Nevada and southern Oregon, along with smaller pockets in Utah and Arizona. Milder drought conditions extend across the rest of the West, except for most of Montana and Wyoming. Other states served by the Colorado River are Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.

Schoolboy Frankie Franz watched the Spanish right-back pull off the staggering trick shot in a video recorded at Barcelona\u2019s Ciutat Esportiva training ground earlier in the month. The viral clip shows the 23-year-old defender lifting the ball into the net to the sound of gasps from his team mates at the Catalonia club. Joking  that he could do the same with his mum and grandmother, nine-year-old Frankie, who is an academy player with Dagenham and Redbridge Football Club, took to the garden to have a go. He moved the basketball hoop into the middle of the goal and after a little run up sent the ball straight through the net first time. In the video he can be seen turning to face the camera looking absolutely gob-smacked as he places his hands behind his head.

Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare.

In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number.

'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition.

'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers.

It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham\u00a0where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries.

After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The\u00a0bizarre\u00a0post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.'

Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April.

Speaking in the latest issue of\u00a0Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former\u00a0senator\u00a0and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.'

Speaking in the latest issue of\u00a0Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former\u00a0senator\u00a0and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.'

Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym.

They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her.

Manhattan-based\u00a0Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post\u00a0was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I\u2019m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects \u2013 including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video\u00a0Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week 'If I hadn\u2019t had [my friend\u2019s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly\u00a0visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently.

[{"generated_text": "<s>[INST] You are given an article and a claim.\nPlease read the <Claim> and find the sentence(s) in the <Article> that express the <Claim>.\n\n<Article>\nA New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based\u00a0Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post\u00a0was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I\u2019m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice.

The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. \"I thought I lost you,\" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,\" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan told CNN. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. \"Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,\" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" he said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. \"You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it,\" he says. \"And I know my son appreciates it.\" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nlouis jordan took his sailboat out in late january and had n't been heard from in 66 days . the younger jordan was on a german-flagged container ship 200 miles from north carolina . \" i was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me , \" jordan said .\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: \u2018A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.\u2019\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nobesity levels were the main factor pushing the uk down the health rankings . britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure . overall , the uk came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity , health and tolerance , putting britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world .\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

The comedian told a 1,000-strong crowd at Warrington's Parr Hall the popstar - who claimed the planned levy on homes worth more than \u00a32 million would hit 'little grannies' - had made her money 'showering in a bikini' and should be 'proud to make a contribution'.

Long-time Labour supporter Eddie Izzard said the party would offer a 'fair chance for everyone'.

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nmonsour alshammari , 27 , is in the u.s. on a saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country 's royal family , according to court documents . he was arrested on friday at the mexican border and is set to be extradited back to utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in february .\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nmonsour alshammari , 27 , is in the u.s. on a saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country 's royal family . he was picked up by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement on friday and a judge in provo signed an arrest warrant on monday to extradite him back to utah . he had been charged on april 3 with rape , a first-degree felony , and obstructing justice , a second-degree felony .\n</Claim>\n\nYour reponse:[/INST]\n\n1.

Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors:\u00a0By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the\u00a0National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.' Permanent vacation It seems Mirreyes\u00a0travel frequently to foreign destinations judging by the photos they post Power: Mirreyes could be important for business and politics in the future because cash attracts friends Ouch: Pics of Mirreyes relaxing don't sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year\n</Article>\n\n<Claim>\nUNK and UNK are often the sons and daughters of the members of mexican high society .

The article states that Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy \"ostentatious spending, exhibitionism, and narcissism\" and are \"placed above all others,\" are often the sons and daughters of members of Mexican high society.\n2. The article mentions that Mirreyes post pictures of luxuries with hashtags, showcasing their wealth and privilege.\n3. The article highlights that the displays of wealth by Mirreyes can lead to political and legal advantages down the road, as they are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessmen, and other members of Mexican high society.\n\nTherefore, the claim that UNK and UNK are often the sons and daughters of members of Mexican high society is supported by the article."}]

Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog --\u00a0That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram\u00a0account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL\u00a0reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out \u2018blindly\u2019. \u2018He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,\u2019 Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. \u2018He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.\u2019 The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week.

Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama\u2019s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at \u2018the world at large\u2019. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out \u2018blindly\u2019. \u2018He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,\u2019 Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. \u2018He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.\u2019 The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly \u2018beside himself\u2019 with grief.

He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the \u00a31million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides\u00a0Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning.

His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past.

Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Another local, Richard Rhoades, who also tried to help Lane, said he took off his shirt to place it over Lane's face when they realised he was dead. 'I just thought it would be nice to close his eyes,' he said. Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'. The lawyer told the jury that for Luna to be found guilty of first degree murder, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the murder was premeditated.

As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than \u00a31,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work\u2013 even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially.

As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than \u00a31,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work\u2013 even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her.

But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night \u2013 before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added.

And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night \u2013 before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added.

Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges \u2013 who are thought to earn more than \u00a3200,000 a year \u2013 of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the \u00a385 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford.

The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow. Sale: Actor Robert Hardy is selling off his collection of antiques including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt Cabinets: A pair of early Victorian items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster which are set to fetch up to \u00a34,000 at the auction on Saturday Portrait: A painting of Mr Hardy holding a longbow, reflecting his interest in medieval history One of the most unusual items featured in the auction of his possessions is a hand-painted limewood diorama depicted the progress of the Battle of Agincourt in 3D. The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to \u00a32,000.

A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.'

The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion'. But that her party want 'chaos and constitutional crisis' at Westminster to force another independence referendum. Scroll down for video Gordon Brown, pictured campaigning this week, has warned that the SNP want to use the chaos after the election to force another referendum on Scottish independence and urged 'patriotic Scots' to vote Labour And he warned that those casting their vote on May 7 will be deciding the future of Scotland for the next few years. Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion. She cannot give a straight answer to the question. 'But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth, that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum. 'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future.

Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion.

He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs.

Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters.

Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament\u00a0announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence,\u00a0Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs.
