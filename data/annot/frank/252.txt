</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that police in the Republic of Ireland are searching for a man who has been missing for more than 20 years.
2. However, the article states that Trevor Deely, a 22-year-old man, went missing in December 2000, which is less than 20 years ago.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it refers to a man missing for more than 20 years, while the article is about a man who went missing 20 years ago.
4. The discrepancy in the time frame is the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that the article is about police in the Republic of Ireland searching for a man who has been missing for more than 20 years.
2. However, the article is about the search for Trevor Deely, a specific individual who went missing in December 2000. The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, including the area being searched, the involvement of the police (Gardaí), and the efforts to identify a man seen in CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests a more general search for a missing person in the Republic of Ireland, while the article is specific to the case of Trevor Deely.
