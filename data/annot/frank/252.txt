    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that police in the Republic of Ireland are searching for a man who has been missing for more than 20 years. However, the article states that Trevor Deely went missing in December 2000, which is not more than 20 years ago. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

2. The summary does not mention anything about a search for Trevor Deely or any efforts to locate him. The article, on the other hand, states that a search of a site in Chapelizod in Dublin started early on Saturday morning and that the search will involve excavations and is expected to take a number of weeks. This suggests that the search for Trevor Deely is ongoing, but the summary does not reflect this.

3. The summary does not mention the CCTV footage that was enhanced using specialist technology, which is a significant detail in the article. The article states that the CCTV footage shows Trevor Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street, where he worked, and that detectives believe the man seen in the CCTV is the same man who was captured on camera following Trevor Deely a short time later on Haddington Road.

4. Finally, the summary does not mention anything about detectives renewing their appeal for the man seen in the CCTV to come forward. The article states that detectives released the footage in April and appealed for the man to come forward, but the summary does not reflect this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of Trevor Deely's disappearance and the ongoing search for him.
