    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat, but the article does not mention anything about abuse or imprisonment. Instead, it states that the man was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intentionally causing her sister and father to look at sexual images.
2. The summary also mentions that the man was sentenced to jail, but the article only mentions that the case was remitted to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because of its greater sentencing powers.
3. The summary does not mention the man's name, while the article identifies the man as Clive Weatherhogg.
4. The summary does not mention any specific dates or timeframes, while the article provides specific dates for the incidents, such as September 2013 to September 2014.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is missing important details and contains inaccuracies, such as the man's name and the specific charges he was found guilty of. Additionally, the summary mentions imprisonment, which is not mentioned in the article.
