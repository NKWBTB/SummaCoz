<Summary>
a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a woman in a dundee flat.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat.
2. The article states that the man, Clive Weatherhogg, was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man, and intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.
3. The article does not mention anything about the man being jailed for sexually abusing the woman in a Dundee flat. Instead, it mentions that he was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man, and intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the charges that Weatherhogg was found guilty of. The summary only mentions sexual abuse, but the article mentions a range of charges including coercion and intentionally causing others to look at sexual images.
5. The reason for the inconsistency is likely that the summary was written in a way that focused on the most sensational aspect of the case, which was the sexual abuse, without accurately reflecting the full range of charges that Weatherhogg was found guilty of.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat.
2. However, the article does not mention that the man was specifically convicted of "sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat." The article provides details about Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister. While the article describes sexual misconduct and harassment, it does not specify that it occurred in a Dundee flat or use the term "sexually abusing."
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary simplifies the charges and circumstances, which are more complex in the article, and uses different terminology that is not directly supported by the article.
