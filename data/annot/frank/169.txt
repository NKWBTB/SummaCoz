    Vincent Barker, known as Vinnie, died in July 2012, five months after he had a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich.The prosecution told Ipswich Crown Court the conduct of eye specialist Honey Rose, 35, was so far below the expected standard it was "criminal".Ms Rose denies a charge of gross negligence manslaughter.Read more on this story and other news from SuffolkJonathan Rees QC said the alleged failure of Ms Rose, of Newham, east London, to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test, and refer him on for further investigation, was "at the heart of the prosecution case".A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death, the court heard."The prosecution allege that Vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant, Ms Rose, done her job properly," he told the jury."Given the risk of death involved, her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent optometrist - that it was criminal."The trial continues. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was cleared of manslaughter, but the article states that the defendant, Ms. Rose, is on trial for gross negligence manslaughter. This is inconsistent, as the summary indicates that the man was not found guilty of any wrongdoing, while the article states that Ms. Rose is being prosecuted for her actions.
2. The summary does not mention any details about Ms. Rose's alleged failure to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs or refer him for further investigation, which is at the heart of the prosecution case, according to the article. This is inconsistent, as the article provides specific details about the prosecution's case against Ms. Rose.
3. The summary does not mention the build-up of fluid in Vinnie's brain or the increase in pressure in his skull, which are also key details mentioned in the article. This is inconsistent, as the article provides specific details about the cause of Vinnie's death, which are not mentioned in the summary.

Overall, the summary does not provide a consistent summary of the article. It does not mention key details about Ms. Rose's alleged failure to detect Vinnie's condition or the cause of his death, which are central to the article's story.
