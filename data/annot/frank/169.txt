Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the trial is for the manslaughter of a man named Vinnie, who died after a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich.
2. The summary states that the trial is for the manslaughter of a woman who was found dead in a routine.
3. The article mentions that the prosecution alleges that the defendant, Ms. Rose, failed to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test and did not refer him for further investigation, which led to his death.
4. The summary does not mention any of these details and instead states that the defendant has been cleared of manslaughter.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the details of the case or the outcome of the trial. The article states that the defendant, Ms. Rose, is accused of gross negligence manslaughter, but the summary incorrectly states that the defendant has been cleared of manslaughter.
