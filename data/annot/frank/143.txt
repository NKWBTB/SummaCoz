Sir Peter Blake, who is now the prize's patron, won the junior title in 1961.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The title of the article is "Peter Simpson wins John Moores Painting Prize with 'quite extraordinary' work".
2. The title of the summary is "a painting by Peter Simpson has won this year's Peter Simpson Award for his 'extraordinary' work".
3. The article states that Peter Simpson won the John Moores Painting Prize with his work "Squint (19)", but the summary claims that he won the "Peter Simpson Award".
4. The John Moores Painting Prize is a biennial art award established in 1957, and it is one of Britain's oldest art awards.
5. The summary does not mention the John Moores Painting Prize or any other information from the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Misrepresents the award that Peter Simpson won (the John Moores Painting Prize instead of the Peter Simpson Award)
* Omits any information about the prize or the article's context (such as the award's history and previous winners)

The summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content, and it is not consistent with the information provided in the article.
