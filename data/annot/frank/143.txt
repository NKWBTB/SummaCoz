Sir Peter Blake, who is now the prize's patron, won the junior title in 1961.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Peter Simpson won the Turner Prize, but the article states that he won the John Moores Painting Prize.
2. The summary mentions that Simpson's painting "Squint (19)" is "extraordinary," but the article does not use that word to describe the painting. Instead, the judge Ansel Krut describes it as "quite extraordinary" and "a little bit like a tone poem."
3. The summary states that Simpson is 76 years old, but the article does not mention his age.
4. The summary says that Simpson has been working on a series of paintings, but the article does not mention that.
5. The summary states that Simpson will spend the prize money on "stretches, canvas, and good quality paints," but the article does not mention that.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations compared to the article.
