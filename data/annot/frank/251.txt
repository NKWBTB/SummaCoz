     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Laura Muir is targeting a place at the summer's Commonwealth Games, but the article states that she will not be competing in the Commonwealth Games due to her university exams.
2. The summary mentions that Muir finished fourth and sixth in the 1500m and 5,000m at the World Athletics Championships, but the article does not mention her finishing positions.
3. The summary states that Muir is looking to compete in the World Indoor Championships in March, but the article states that she will not be competing in the World Indoor Championships due to her studies.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. The article provides different information about Muir's plans and performances, so the summary should not have included that information.
