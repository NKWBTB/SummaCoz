     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary states that Rickie Fowler's girlfriend Alexis Randock is a gold digger and doesn't have to work for a living, while the article states that Alexis works hard to support herself and is not a gold digger.

Step 2: Analyze the article

The article states that Alexis posted a photo on her Instagram account of her and her sister on the beach, which was shared with her 25,000 followers. One of her followers, known as 'fatalsplash,' left an abusive comment accusing Alexis of being a gold digger. Rickie Fowler, Alexis' boyfriend, defended her by responding to the troll and telling him to get his facts straight. Alexis also stood up for herself by pointing out that she works hard to support herself in NYC.

Step 3: Analyze the summary

The summary states that Alexis is a gold digger and doesn't have to work for a living. This is not supported by the article, which states that Alexis works hard to support herself.

Step 4: Identify the reason for the inconsistency

The inconsistency between the summary and the article is likely due to the fact that the summary is based on an inaccurate assumption that Alexis is a gold digger and doesn't have to work for a living. This assumption is not supported by the article, which provides evidence that Alexis works hard to support herself.

Step 5: Explain the inconsistency
