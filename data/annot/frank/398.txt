The provided summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and misleading statements. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Inaccurate statement: The summary states that Alexis Randock posted a photo on her Instagram account of her and her sister Nicole on the beach last week. However, the article states that the photo was posted by Alexis' sister Nicole, not Alexis.
2. Misleading statement: The summary states that Rickie Fowler accused Alexis of being a "gold digger." However, the article states that the person who made the accusation was a troll named "fatalsplash," not Rickie Fowler.
3. Inaccurate statement: The summary states that Alexis was quick to judge and accused the troll of working at McDonald's. However, the article states that the troll was the one who made the accusation, not Alexis.
4. Misleading statement: The summary states that Alexis' user name was called "fatalsplash." However, the article states that the troll's user name was "fatalsplash," not Alexis' user name.
5. Inconsistent tone: The summary uses a casual tone, stating that Alexis "also was quick to judge" and "accused of working at McDonald's." However, the article uses a more formal tone and does not mention Alexis accusing the troll of working at McDonald's.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and misleading statements that do not accurately reflect the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that a troll called 'fatalsplash' accused Alexis Randock of being a 'gold digger,' and both Rickie Fowler and Alexis responded to this accusation.
2. However, the article states that 'fatalsplash' is the one who accused Alexis Randock of being a 'gold digger' and that Rickie Fowler and Alexis Randock responded to this accusation. The article provides the correct sequence of events.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary that suggests that Alexis Randock accused herself of working at McDonald's. This is not accurate; the article correctly attributes the accusation to 'fatalsplash' and the responses to Rickie Fowler and Alexis Randock.
