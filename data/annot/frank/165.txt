     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is "thrilled" by the case, but the article states that he has criticized the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in "secret". This suggests that Mr. Ratcliffe is not thrilled by the case, but rather frustrated and concerned about his wife's situation.
2. The summary does not mention that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest, as reported in the article.
3. The summary does not mention that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's two-year-old daughter Gabriella has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents, as reported in the article.
4. The summary does not mention that the family cannot go to Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's appeal hearing and do not know when to expect a result, as reported in the article.
5. The summary does not mention that Mr. Ratcliffe believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK, as reported in the article.
6. The summary does not mention that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed, as reported in the article.
7. The summary does not mention that Mr. Ratcliffe said the final outcome of the appeal "might come today, it might come next week", as reported in the article.
8. The summary does not mention that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail, as reported in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It omits many important details and presents a more positive view of the situation than the article actually reports.
