    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the man was ordered to pay more than £20,000, but the article does not mention any fine or payment.
2. The summary mentions a woman being found dead at a bar, but the article does not mention any death or fatality.
3. The summary states that the bar was ordered to be closed for three months, but the article does not mention any closure of the bar.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article. The article only mentions the closure of the bar for three months and the fines imposed on the license holder and her partner, but it does not mention a death or any payment of £20,000.
