When Utah photographer Alan Lawrence learned that his newborn son, Wil, had Down Syndrome his 'mind was flooded with many emotions, most of which were not positive.' Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog -- That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the father, Steven Lawrence, created a photo series in which his son, who has Down syndrome, appears to be flying.
2. However, the article states that the father, Alan Lawrence, created the photo series, not Steven Lawrence.
3. The summary also states that the father took the limits off his son and opened many doors for his family, but the article does not mention this.
4. The article states that the father created the illusion of Wil flying by holding him up in the photos and cropping himself out, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article mentions that the father created the photo series to raise awareness about Down syndrome and that he plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down syndrome foundations, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the father's name, the purpose of the photo series, and the methods used to create the illusion of Wil flying.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Steven Lawrence created a photo series in which his 9-year-old son has Down Syndrome. The father created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later grinding himself out. The father of five has taken the limits off and has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family.
2. However, the article states that Utah photographer Alan Lawrence created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly,' featuring his 18-month-old son, Wil, who has Down Syndrome. The article does not mention a son named Steven or a 9-year-old.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly attributes the photo series and the child's age to Steven Lawrence, whereas the article attributes it to Alan Lawrence and mentions an 18-month-old child named Wil.
