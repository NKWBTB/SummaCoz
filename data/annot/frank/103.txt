    Summary: 
    an 18th century museum in london is to reopen as part of an art collection campaign to save it from being sold at auction. 

    Article: 
    About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday."Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news"."The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the museum in London is reopening as part of an art collection campaign to save it from being sold at auction. However, the article does not mention anything about the museum reopening. Instead, it talks about the collection being saved from being sold at auction.
2. The summary mentions that the collection is being sold to save the museum, but the article states that the collection is being saved from being sold at auction. This implies that the museum is not in danger of being sold, but rather the collection is.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the collection being loaned to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is mentioned in the article.
4. The article states that the collection was inherited by the Wedgwood Museum after Waterford Wedgwood plc collapsed in 2009, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article mentions that the collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article focuses on the saving of the Wedgwood collection from being sold at auction, while the summary focuses on the reopening of a museum in London. Additionally, the summary does not mention several key details that are included in the article, such as the loan of the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the risk of the collection being scattered around the globe.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that an 18th-century museum in London is reopening as part of an art collection campaign.
2. However, the article mentions a fundraising campaign to save the collection being saved from being sold at auction and the collection will be remain on display at a museum in Staffordshire.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests that an 18th-century museum in London is reopening as part of an art collection campaign, while the article does not contain any information about such a reopening.
