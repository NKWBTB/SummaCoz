</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "plans to renovate Alexandra Palace in North London have been approved by the council."
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the council approving plans for renovation. Instead, it talks about the theatre and studios being repaired and refurbished as part of a larger restoration project.
3. The article also mentions that the project is hoping to raise funds to complete the restoration, and that the theatre has been unused for decades and still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place.
4. Based on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article does not mention any approval of plans by the council, and instead focuses on the restoration and refurbishment of the theatre and studios.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is likely that the information in the summary is not supported by the article.
