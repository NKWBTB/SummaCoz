    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that plans to renovate Alexandra Palace have been approved by the council, but the article does not mention any approval process or mention the council's involvement.
2. The summary mentions that the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music, but the article only mentions theatrical performances and cinema screenings.
3. The summary states that the BBC studios will be repaired and refurbished, but the article does not mention the BBC or any studios.
4. The summary mentions that the theatre will reopen in 2018 if funds are raised, but the article does not mention any specific timeline for the reopening.
5. The summary mentions that the entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of £26.6m, but the article only mentions the theatre and studios as part of the restoration project.
6. The summary states that the Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust has committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017, but the article does not mention any specific fundraising efforts or timeline.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as the council's involvement, the BBC studios, and a specific timeline for the reopening of the theatre. Additionally, the summary mentions the theatre being used for more types of entertainment than what is mentioned in the article.
