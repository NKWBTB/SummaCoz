A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded.Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win.The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties.More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up.However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break.Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.Gloucester: Marshall; Sharples, Trinder, Twelvetrees, May; Burns, Heinz (capt); McAllister, Hibbard, Hohneck, Savage, Thrush, Moriarty, Rowan, Morgan.Replacements: Matu'u, Thomas, Afoa, Galarza, Ludlow, Braley, Atkinson, Purdy.Cardiff Blues: Morgan; Cuthbert, Lee-Lo, Shingler, Scully; Anscombe, Williams; Jenkins (capt), Dacey, Filise, Earle, Hoeata, Warburton, Navidi, Williams.Replacements: Rees, Domachowski, Assiratti, Cook, Bennett, Williams, Halaholo, Summerhill.Referee: Pascal Gauzere (France)For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.

<Summary>
cardiff blues suffered their first european challenge cup defeat of the season as gloucester came from behind to beat gloucester at kingsholm.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Cardiff Blues suffered their first European Challenge Cup defeat of the season, but the article states that they failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. This is not consistent with the summary's statement.
2. The summary also states that Gloucester came from behind to beat Cardiff Blues, but the article does not mention anything about Cardiff Blues being ahead at any point during the game. This is not consistent with the summary's statement.
3. The summary only mentions one try scored by Cardiff Blues, which was by Cuthbert, but the article mentions two tries scored by Cardiff Blues, one by Cuthbert and another by Shingler. This is not consistent with the summary's statement.
4. The summary does not mention the final score of the game, but the article states that Gloucester won the game 23-20. This is not consistent with the summary's statement.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Cardiff Blues suffered their first European Challenge Cup defeat of the season.
2. However, the article discusses a rugby match between Cardiff Blues and Gloucester, mentioning various events and scores during the game. It provides details about the match, but it doesn't confirm or elaborate on whether this was Cardiff Blues' first European Challenge Cup defeat of the season.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary making a specific claim about Cardiff Blues' season performance, which is not directly addressed in the article. The article mainly focuses on the match's events and outcome.
