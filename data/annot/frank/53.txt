    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Montrose has appointed Paul Sheerin as their new manager on a two-year contract.

However, the article does not mention anything about Montrose appointing Paul Sheerin as their manager. Instead, it talks about Sheerin leaving Arbroath to join Aberdeen as a coach.

2. The article states that Sheerin has been player-manager at Arbroath since 2010 and has guided the team to their first national trophy in their history by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011.

There is no mention of Sheerin ever managing Montrose in the article.

3. The summary also states that Sheerin replaces Neil Cooper at Pittodrie, which is not true according to the article. Cooper is still the manager of Aberdeen, and Sheerin is joining the club as a coach.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reasons for this inconsistency are:

a. The summary mentions Montrose appointing Sheerin as their manager, but the article does not mention anything about this.

b. The summary states that Sheerin replaces Cooper at Pittodrie, but the article does not mention anything about this.

c. The article does not mention anything about Sheerin joining Montrose.
