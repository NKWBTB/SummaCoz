     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the Northern Ireland Assembly has approved a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offenses, but the article does not mention approval. Instead, the article states that Justice Minister Claire Sugden has confirmed that a motion will go before the assembly for approval.
2. The summary mentions that the proposal will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, where plans for automatic pardons were announced last month. However, the article does not mention anything about England and Wales.
3. The summary states that the law will allow for pardons both posthumously and for living gay and bisexual men, but the article only mentions posthumous pardons.
4. The summary quotes Justice Minister Claire Sugden as saying that the motion will be brought in "as soon as possible," but the article does not mention any specific timeline.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as the approval of the proposal and the mention of England and Wales. Additionally, the summary includes quotes that are not present in the article.
