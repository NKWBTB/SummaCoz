There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

<Summary>
the scottish government has been accused of ``burying the size of taxation\'\'by the scottish government.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Scottish government has been accused of "burying the size of taxation."
2. The article does not mention anything about the Scottish government hiding or downplaying the size of taxation. In fact, the article states that the Commission on Local Tax Reform found that the current council tax system has many deficiencies and that change and reform would be a major undertaking.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary implies that the Scottish government is trying to hide the size of taxation, but the article does not support this claim.
4. The article actually focuses on the findings of the Commission on Local Tax Reform and the challenges of reforming the council tax system, rather than the size of taxation.
5. Therefore, the summary is misleading and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary accuses the Scottish government of "burying the size of taxation."
2. However, the article does not contain any statement or information that directly accuses the Scottish government of burying the size of taxation. It primarily discusses a review by the Commission on Local Tax Reform and the challenges associated with the council tax system.
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of the specific accusation against the Scottish government, which is not supported by the article's content. The article does not make such an accusation.
