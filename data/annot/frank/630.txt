Germans now think of themselves as the victims of Hitler and his Nazi Regime Germans no longer see the Second World War as a defeatÂ and now think of themselves as victims of the Nazis, it has been claimed. Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation. Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade. Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported. The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin. Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared. 'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling. Only nine per cent of Germans now consider the end of the conflict a defeat. Pictured:Operation Overlord in June 1944

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the new museum in Munich is dedicated to exploring the history of the Nazi movement and its impact on everyday Germans, but the summary claims that the museum is dedicated to solving the city's past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement.
2. The article mentions that the museum charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in Munich in 1920, but the summary does not mention this detail.
3. The article states that only 9% of Germans consider the end of the Second World War a defeat, but the summary does not mention this fact.
4. The article mentions that the museum opening is part of Germany's effort to examine its past, including the murder of millions considered unworthy of life, but the summary does not mention this aspect of the museum or Germany's efforts to confront its past.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary omits key details and misrepresents the purpose of the new museum in Munich.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that the German city of Munich is opening a new museum dedicated to exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans.
2. However, the article does mention the German city of Munich opening a new museum, but it focuses on the Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism, which charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in Munich in 1920. The article does not explicitly state that the museum is dedicated to exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans. The summary's statement is not accurately supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the museum's primary focus is on the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, while the article provides a broader context about the museum's purpose.
