    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that plans have been submitted for a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront, but the article does not mention any plans for a glass tower.
2. The article does mention a "merchant city" development, but there is no mention of a glass tower as part of this development.
3. The summary states that the power station closed in 2013, but the article states that the power station was commissioned in 1971.
4. The summary mentions a £1bn development, but the article does not provide any information about the cost of the development.
5. The summary mentions fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth, but the article does not mention any ferry links.
6. The summary states that the chimney of the power station would be the centrepiece of the development, but the article does not mention any plans to preserve the chimney.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as a glass tower, and omits information that is present in the article, such as the fact that the power station was commissioned in 1971 and that there are no plans to preserve the chimney.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions plans for a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront.
2. However, the article discusses plans for a glass structure at the disused Fawley power station, which is not located on the edge of Southampton seafront but rather on the western side of Southampton Water.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mentions the plan of glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront, while the article provides more detailed information about plans for a glass structure at the disused Fawley power station.
