    the local authorities in scotland have " serious problems " with the council tax system, a report has found.

There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the local authorities in Scotland have "serious problems" with the council tax system, but the article does not mention any such problems. In fact, the article states that the current council tax system has many deficiencies, but it does not imply that the local authorities have serious problems with it.
2. The summary suggests that the council tax system is flawed and needs to be reformed, but the article does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Instead, it presents a review that found no "magic bullet" to cure defects in the system, and notes that reform will be difficult and bound up with past experiences and traumas.
3. The summary mentions a report by the Commission on Local Tax Reform, but the article does not mention any such report. The article only mentions that the commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.
4. The summary suggests that the council tax system is unfair, but the article does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Instead, it notes that a local income tax, used by many countries, is generally perceived as fairer, but it also creates difficulties for local authorities.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it presents a more negative and critical view of the council tax system, which is not supported by the information in the article. The article presents a more balanced view of the system, noting its deficiencies but also acknowledging the challenges of reforming it.
