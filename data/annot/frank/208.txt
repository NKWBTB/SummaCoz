There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the local authorities in Scotland have "serious problems" with the council tax system.
2. However, the article does not mention any specific problems with the council tax system. Instead, it discusses the limitations and challenges of the current system and the need for reform.
3. The article mentions that the Commission on Local Tax Reform found that the council tax has built-in problems "from day one" and that a failure to modify it has stored up more difficulties for policy makers.
4. The article also mentions that the commission will report back later this year with recommendations for reform.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article does not mention "serious problems" with the council tax system, but rather discusses the need for reform and the challenges of the current system.

###Corrected:
1. The summary suggests that local authorities in Scotland have encountered significant issues with the council tax system, as described in a report.
2. However, the article discusses the problems and challenges associated with the council tax system but does not explicitly use the phrase or mention that local authorities in Scotland have "serious problems" with the system.
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of the specific phrase "serious problems," which is not directly supported by the article. The article conveys issues with the council tax system but doesn't use this exact wording.
