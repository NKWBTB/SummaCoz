With just two weekends of Football League action to play, and one in the Conference, it is crunch time for a number of clubs. Some are fighting for promotion and some relegation, but this Saturday could see a number of ups and downs in English football. Here, Sportsmail's guide takes you through the permutations in the Championship, League One, League Two and the Conference. Watford can be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth or Middlesbrough lose and Norwich fail to win Rotherham's desire to stave off relegation to League One has been made more difficult by a points deduction Steve McClaren will be desperate to manage in the Premier League again; Derby can secure a play-off spot Championship Watford (away to Brighton) will be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth (home to Bolton, Monday) or Middlesbrough (away to Fulham) lose and Norwich (away to Rotherham) fail to win. Derby (away to Millwall) will make sure of a play-off place if they win. Ipswich (home to Nottingham Forest) will make sure of a play-off place if they win and both Brentford (away to Reading) and Wolves (away to Wigan) fail to win. The situation at the bottom is complicated by Rotherham's three-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player. If Rotherham win,Â Wigan will be relegated if they fail to win. If Rotherham win, Millwall will be relegated if they lose. League One Preston (home to Swindon) will be promoted if they win and MK Dons (away to Rochdale) lose. Sheffield United (away to Leyton Orient) and Chesterfield (home to Bristol City) will be guaranteed play-off places with wins or if Rochdale fail to win. Leyton Orient (home to Sheff Utd) and Notts County (home to Doncaster) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe (away to Coventry) win and Crawley (away to Peterborough) avoid defeat. Colchester (away to Fleetwood) will be relegated if they lose and Crewe and Crawley win and Port Vale (away to Yeovil) avoid defeat. Jermaine Beckford (left) and Daniel Johnson celebrate; Preston can be promoted if they win and MK Dons lose Burton Albion have already been promoted but they can secure champion status this weekend League Two Already-promoted Burton (home to Northampton) will be champions if they win and Shrewsbury (away to Cheltenham) fail to win. Shrewsbury will be promoted if they win or if one of Wycombe (home to Morecambe) or Southend (home to Luton) fails to win. Stevenage (home to Carlisle) will guarantee a play-off place if they win or if one of Plymouth (home to Tranmere) or Luton fails to win. Tranmere will be relegated if they lose and if one of Hartlepool (home to Exeter) or Cheltenham win. Tranmere will also be relegated if they fail to win and Hartlepool win. Cheltenham will be relegated if they lose and Hartlepool win. ........................................................................... Conference Barnet (home to Gateshead) will be promoted as champions if they win. Bristol Rovers (home to Alfreton) will be promoted as champions if they win and Barnet fail to win. Eastleigh (home to Kidderminster) and Forest Green (home to Dover) will guarantee play-off places if they win or if Macclesfield (away to Torquay) fail to win. Macclesfield need to win and hope either Eastleigh lose or Forest Green fail to win. Barring a 14-goal swing, Alfreton will be relegated if they lose. Welling (home to Southport) will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton draw or if they draw and Alfreton win. Southport will be relegated if they lose and Alfreton win by reversing an eight-goal goal-difference deficit. It is make or break for Bristol Rovers boss Darrell Clarke this weekend - they can be promoted as champions

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Derby will be promoted if they win and MK Dons win.
2. However, the article states that Derby will be promoted if they win and one of Bournemouth or Middlesbrough lose, and Norwich fail to win.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Bournemouth or Middlesbrough, nor does it mention Norwich.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it only mentions MK Dons, while the article mentions several other teams and their potential impact on Derby's promotion.
5. Additionally, the summary states that Derby will be promoted if they lose and Leyton Orient lose, which is not correct according to the article.
6. The article states that if Rotherham win, Wigan will be relegated if they fail to win, and if Rotherham win, Millwall will be relegated if they lose.
7. The summary does not mention anything about Rotherham, Wigan, or Millwall, which further highlights the inconsistency between the two.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions MK Dons, while the article mentions several other teams and their potential impact on Derby's promotion. Additionally, the summary does not accurately reflect the relegation scenarios mentioned in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Derby will be promoted if they win and MK Dons win over Derby. It also implies that Derby will be promoted if they lose and Leyton Orient lose.
2. However, the article provides information related to promotions and relegations in different football leagues, including the Championship, League One, League Two, and the Conference. It mentions that Derby will make sure of a play-off place if they win, but it does not mention anything about MK Dons. Similarly, it mentions Sheffield United and Chesterfield for play-off places but does not mention Leyton Orient. The information in the summary about Derby's promotion conditions and Leyton Orient's involvement is not supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the article provides specific information about promotions and relegations in various clubs but does not mention the specific scenarios described in the summary, which is incorrect.
