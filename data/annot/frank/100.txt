    Summary: 
    the collection of the oldest collection in the uk, the wedgwood museum, has been saved after a campaign to save it. 

    Article: 
    About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday."Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news"."The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said.

     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the Wedgwood Museum collection has been saved, but the article states that the collection has been sold.

2. The summary mentions that the collection will remain on display at the museum, but the article states that the collection will be gifted to the Victoria and Albert Museum and then loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.

3. The summary does not mention the fact that the museum went into administration in 2010 and that a high court judge ruled that the collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.

4. The summary does not mention the involvement of the Art Fund in the campaign to save the collection, nor does it mention the public fundraising campaign that was launched in September.

5. The summary does not provide any information about the amount of money raised or the identity of the buyer.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide a complete and accurate account of the situation. It is missing important details and contains inaccuracies, such as the fact that the collection has been sold rather than saved.
