    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that James Milner has announced his retirement from international football with the Republic of Ireland.
2. However, the article states that Milner has played for England, not the Republic of Ireland.
3. The article mentions that Milner has won 61 caps for England and was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships.
4. There is no mention of Milner playing for the Republic of Ireland in the article.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to Milner playing for the wrong country.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Milner has announced his retirement from international football with the Republic of Ireland, when in fact he has played only for England.
