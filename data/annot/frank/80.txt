</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that James Milner has retired from international football with England, not the Republic of Ireland.
2. The summary states that James Milner has retired from international football with the Republic of Ireland.
3. These two statements are contradictory, as Milner has only played for England at the international level and has not played for the Republic of Ireland.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is incorrect to say that Milner has retired from international football with the Republic of Ireland.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that England midfielder James Milner has announced his retirement from international football with the Republic of Ireland.
2. However, the article clearly states that James Milner announced his retirement from international football. It does not mention any affiliation with the Republic of Ireland.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces incorrect information regarding James Milner's international retirement and affiliation with the Republic of Ireland. The article focuses on his retirement from international football without specifying any new association.
