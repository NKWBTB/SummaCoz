</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the Su-24 jet was downed on November 24th, but the summary claims that the incident occurred on Saturday. This is a inconsistency, as Saturday is not a specific date and could refer to any day of the week, whereas November 24th is a specific date.
2. The article mentions that the downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, and that Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey, but the summary does not mention any of this information. This is another inconsistency, as the summary does not provide a complete picture of the situation.
3. The article states that the Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters, but the summary does not mention this information. This is another inconsistency, as the summary does not provide a complete picture of the situation.
4. The article mentions that both crew members ejected, but the pilot was killed, and a Russian marine was sent to rescue the crew and was killed, and a helicopter was destroyed on the ground. The summary does not mention any of this information. This is another inconsistency, as the summary does not provide a complete picture of the situation.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not provide a complete picture of the situation and omits important details such as the date of the incident, the fact that the jet was shot down by F-16 fighters, and the consequences of the incident, such as the sanctions imposed by Russia on Turkey.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a Russian investigation is underway into the downing of a Russian warplane by Turkey on Saturday.
2. However, the article does not mention that the downing of the Russian warplane occurred on Saturday, and it doesn't provide a specific date for the incident. The article mentions that the Su-24 jet was shot down on November 24, but it doesn't confirm whether that was a Saturday.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which specifies that the incident occurred on a Saturday, while the article does not provide the exact day of the week for the event.
