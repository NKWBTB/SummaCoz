    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the council leader, Andrew Cowes, is "disappointed" that a meeting with the council leader has been suspended. However, the article does not mention anything about a meeting being suspended.
2. The article does mention that the council leader, Dave Stewart, has ordered a review of the project by auditors and that the crossing at Cowes will be free until July 2 to allow for feedback.
3. The article also mentions that the chain ferry has experienced several problems, including breaking down, running aground, and training issues.
4. The summary does not mention any of these problems or the council's response to them. Instead, it focuses solely on the council leader's disappointment about the suspended meeting.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content or issues discussed in the article.

Overall, the summary is not a good representation of the article and does not provide an accurate summary of the content.
