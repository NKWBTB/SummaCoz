    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Britain's Storey retained her Olympic 100m title, but the article does not mention anything about an Olympic 100m title. The article only mentions the track cycling world championships in London.
2. The summary states that Storey won the title in London, but the article states that the event was held in Nottwil, Switzerland.
3. The summary mentions nothing about Paralympic success or Rio de Janeiro, but the article mentions that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro.
4. The summary states that Storey has won 22 medals, but the article only mentions 21 world titles across both sports.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the event, location, and Storey's achievements.
