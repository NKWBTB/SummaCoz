Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the event was held in Nottwil, Switzerland, but the summary claims that the event was held in London.
2. The article mentions that Storey won the race by more than two minutes, but the summary does not include this information.
3. The article states that Storey won a 17th title, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that Storey has won 22 medals, including 11 golds, 8 silvers, and 3 bronzes, but the summary does not include this information.
5. The article states that Storey began her sporting career in the pool, winning six medals at the 1992 Paralympics before switching to cycling in 2005, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of Storey's victory, such as the location of the event, the margin of victory, and Storey's achievements and background.
