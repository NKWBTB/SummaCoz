We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said.Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015).A council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence."The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that six residential homes in Southampton are facing eviction due to a shortage of council tenants. However, the article does not mention anything about eviction.
2. The article focuses on the requirement for landlords to obtain a licence for Houses of Multiple Occupation (HMOs) in Southampton, and the penalties for not doing so. It does not mention anything about council tenants or eviction.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a new topic (eviction) that is not present in the article. The article only discusses the licensing requirements for HMOs and the penalties for non-compliance.
4. The article does mention that there are a large number of unlicensed HMOs in Southampton (estimated at 1,500), but this is not related to the topic of eviction.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate because it introduces a false or misleading statement (eviction) that is not supported by the article.
