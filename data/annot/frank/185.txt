The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September.Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects.The UK detectives will now compile a report and "update the families of Hannah and David," a spokesman said."Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," the Met Police said in a statement."They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings."The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit."Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings.Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions.The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty.However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation.The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment.The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand.He had previously rejected offers of assistance.Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds.Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the police are returning to Thailand to continue their investigation, but the article states that the UK detectives have completed their work and will be returning to the UK to compile their report and update the families of the victims.
2. The summary does not mention the confessions of the two suspects, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, or the charges they face, while the article mentions that they have confessed to the killings and are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape, and robbery.
3. The summary does not mention the concerns raised by the UK Foreign Office about the police investigation, while the article mentions that the UK Foreign Office summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the verification of DNA samples and allegations of mistreatment of the suspects.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include important details about the investigation, such as the confessions of the suspects and the concerns raised by the UK Foreign Office.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the police investigating the murders of two British tourists on the Thai island of Koh Tao are to return to Thailand.
2. The article discusses the work of Metropolitan Police officers in Thailand, who were reviewing the investigation into the murders of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge. The article mentions that the UK detectives would be returning to the UK to compile their report and update the victims' families on their findings. The article does not explicitly state that the police officers are returning to Thailand.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary's statement that the police are returning to Thailand, which is not explicitly supported by the article. The article primarily focuses on the work that the UK detectives have completed in Thailand and their plans to return to the UK to compile a report and update the victims' families.
