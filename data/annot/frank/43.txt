     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the cat died after a "massive" chemical spill, but the article does not mention the word "massive" or any information about the amount of chemicals involved.
2. The summary says that the cat died on Monday, but the article states that the cat died three days after being taken to the vet, which would be Thursday or Friday.
3. The summary does not mention that the other cats in the area had also died, while the article states that three other cats in the area had died in the last seven days and another cat had died two weeks ago.
4. The summary does not mention the RSPCA inspector's appeal for people to ensure pesticides and chemicals were stored safely, which is a significant detail in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits several important details and includes some inaccuracies.
