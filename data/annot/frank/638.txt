Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also knownÂ as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

  Sure, I can help you identify the errors in the summary. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the main points of the article

The article discusses the trend of septum piercings, its history, and how it is worn in different cultures. The main points are:

* The septum piercing is not a new trend but has been around for years.
* It has been worn by various celebrities like FKA Twigs, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga.

The summary contains the following errors:

* Lady Gaga and Lourdes Leon are not the only celebrities who have worn septum piercings. The article mentions other celebrities like FKA Twigs, Rihanna, and Zoe Kravitz who have also worn them.
* The summary states that the septum piercing is used as nose stud in Nepal tribes, but the article does not mention anything about nose studs.
* The summary states that the septum piercing is used as war paint in Nepal tribes, but the article does not mention anything about war paint.

Step 3: Analyze the reasons for the errors

The errors in the summary likely occurred due to a lack of careful reading and understanding of the article. The summary seems to have focused only on the mentions of Lady Gaga and Lourdes Leon, and ignored the other information in the article. Additionally, the summary may have been influenced by a misunderstanding of the term "nose stud," which is not mentioned in the article.

Step 4: Provide feedback

Based on the analysis, the summary is not consistent with the article. To improve the summary, it should have included all the main points of the article, such as the history of septum piercings, its different meanings and uses in different cultures, and the various celebrities who have worn them. Additionally, the summary should have avoided making assumptions or errors, such as the mention of nose studs and war paint, which are not present in the article.

###Corrected:

2. However, the article does mention Lady Gaga and Lourdes Leon adopting the trend, which aligns with the summary's statement.
3. There is no inconsistency in this case as the summary accurately reflects the information provided in the article about Lady Gaga and Lourdes Leon wearing the septum ring.
