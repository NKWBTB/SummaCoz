The car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop."I am satisfied that having heard all the evidence... much of it circumstantial, nevertheless, in my view it is overwhelming."I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barry John Pring has been unlawfully killed."She said the case demonstrated the difficulty in investigating a case of a death abroad, adding: "Our thoughts and condolences must go to the family who have endured years and years of distress and unhappiness."Close friend Peter Clifford, a lawyer, told the inquest he had "no reasonable doubt" that Barry was murdered.Ms Ziuzina, known as Anna, was 19 years younger than her husband. She tried to claim his assets within days of his death.His family believe he was killed in a staged hit and run accident.The couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement.Mr Pring's mother, Irene Pring, said Ms Ziuzina claimed to be a teacher when the pair first met, but she was in fact a lap dancer and stripper.She said: "We are sure Anna had some involvement in his death to inherit his money and property."I was quite surprised how cold she was with Barry.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the man was "shot in the head by his wife," which is not supported by the article. The article states that the man was killed by a speeding car, not shot by his wife.
2. The word "shot" is a very specific term that implies a deliberate and intentional act. The article does not suggest that the wife intentionally killed her husband. Instead, the article states that the wife was not present when her husband was killed and that she had returned to a restaurant to retrieve a missing glove.
3. The summary implies that the wife was responsible for the husband's death, which is not supported by the article. The article states that the cause of death was a speeding car, not the wife's actions.
4. The summary does not provide any context or details about the husband's death, such as the location or circumstances of the incident. The article provides a detailed account of the husband's death, including the location (a dual carriageway in Kiev), the time of day (around 11pm), and the fact that the husband was trying to hail a taxi when he was hit by the speeding car.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate and misleading information about the husband's death. The summary implies that the wife intentionally killed her husband, which is not supported by the article. Additionally, the summary lacks context and details about the husband's death, which are provided in the article.
