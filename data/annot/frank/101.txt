    Summary: 
    a collection of art worth more than # 100,000 has been donated to a county durham museum. 

    Article: 
    About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday."Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news"."The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a collection of art worth over £100,000 has been donated to a county Durham museum.

2. However, the article states that the collection was facing auction to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt, and that the Art Fund led a public fundraising campaign to save the collection.

3. The article does not mention any donation of the collection to a county Durham museum. Instead, it states that the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire, and will eventually be loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.

4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it incorrectly states that the collection has been donated to a county Durham museum, while the article states that the collection has been saved for display at the Wedgwood Museum in Staffordshire.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions that a collection of art worth more than £100,000 has been donated to a County Durham museum.
2. However, the article states that the collection was facing auction to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt, and that the Art Fund led a public fundraising campaign to save the collection. 
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly states that the collection has been donated to a county Durham museum, while the article does not mention any donation of the collection to a county Durham museum.
