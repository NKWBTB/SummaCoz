    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the main points of the summary.

The summary states that a 23-year-old man died after a shooting outside a house in Sheffield.

Step 2: Identify the main points of the article.

The article states that the victim was fatally injured outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, close to the city center. The victim was either in or close to a black Mercedes car when he was shot. The article also mentions that armed police sealed off the area, and the victim was taken to Northern General hospital but died from his injuries.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies.

The inconsistency is that the summary states that the man died after a shooting outside a house, while the article states that the victim was fatally injured outside a property. The word "house" is not mentioned in the article, only "property."

Step 4: Explain the inconsistency.

The inconsistency is likely due to the fact that the article uses the term "property" to refer to the location where the shooting occurred, which could include a house or other types of buildings. The summary, on the other hand, uses the term "house" to refer to the location, which is not accurate according to the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the man died after a shooting outside a house, when the article actually says he died after a shooting outside a property.
