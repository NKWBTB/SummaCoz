<Article>
The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September.Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects.The UK detectives will now compile a report and "update the families of Hannah and David," a spokesman said."Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," the Met Police said in a statement."They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings."The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit."Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings.Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions.The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty.However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation.The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment.The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand.He had previously rejected offers of assistance.Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds.Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.

<Summary>
police investigating the murders of two british tourists in thailand have returned to the uk.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "police investigating the murders of two British tourists in Thailand have returned to the UK."
2. However, the article states that the police team will be returning to the UK to compile their report and update the families of the victims, but does not mention returning from Thailand.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that the police have completed their investigation in Thailand and returned to the UK, while the article states that the police will be compiling their report and updating the families of the victims.
4. The inconsistency is likely due to the fact that the summary is a brief summary of the article, and does not include all the details mentioned in the article. The summary focuses only on the fact that the police have returned to the UK, while the article provides more information about the investigation and the charges against the suspects.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the police investigating the murders of two British tourists in Thailand have returned to the UK.
2. The article discusses the work of Metropolitan Police officers who were in Thailand to review the investigation into the murders of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge. However, the article does not explicitly mention that these police officers have returned to the UK, nor does it provide a specific update on their current location or status.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary's statement about the police returning to the UK, which is not explicitly supported by the article. The article focuses on the work these officers have completed in Thailand and their plans to compile a report and update the victims' families but does not provide information about their return to the UK.
