</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that contraband has been thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison.
2. The article does not mention anything about contraband being thrown over the wall. Instead, it talks about packages being hurled over the wall and the prison being "flooded" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis.
3. The article also mentions that the Ministry of Justice is working to stop contraband from getting into prisons, but there is no mention of contraband being thrown over the wall.
4. The former inmate in the article claims that drones are being used to fly contraband goods "straight up to prison windows", but the Ministry of Justice denies this.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions contraband being thrown over the wall, which is not supported by the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that the Justice Secretary has said that contraband has been thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison.
2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses the issues of contraband being thrown over the wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, but it does not attribute this statement to the Justice Secretary.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests that the Justice Secretary made a specific statement that is not present in the article.
