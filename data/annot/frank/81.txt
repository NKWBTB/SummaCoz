</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Milner won 61 caps for England and was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships. This indicates that Milner has played for England in the past and has a significant amount of experience.
2. The summary states that Milner has announced his retirement from international football. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Milner retiring from international football.
3. The article states that Milner has played for England at the World Cup and European Championships, which suggests that he is still actively playing for the national team.
4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Milner retiring from international football.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it states that Milner has retired from international football, while the article does not mention anything about retirement.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that former England midfielder Adam Milner has announced his retirement from international football.
2. However, the article discusses the retirement of a former England international footballer, but it doesn't mention the name Adam Milner. The article provides some information about the player's international career, but it doesn't specifically state that Adam Milner has announced his retirement from international football.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a specific name (Adam Milner) that is not mentioned in the article.
