    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Adam Milner has announced his retirement from international football, but the article does not mention anything about retirement. Instead, the article mentions that Milner has played for England in the past and holds the record for the most capped England Under-21 player.
2. The summary mentions that Milner played for England at two World Cups and two European Championships, but the article only mentions that he was a squad member at Euro 2016 and did not play for England at the World Cups.
3. The summary states that Milner said "The decision we've reached is about common sense," but there is no quote from Milner in the article.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and may be incorrect or incomplete.
