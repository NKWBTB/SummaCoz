st mirren have signed forward jeremy clarkson on loan from dundee until the end of the season.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that St Mirren has signed Jeremy Clarkson on loan from Dundee until the end of the season.
2. However, the article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
3. This implies that Clarkson is not joining St Mirren on loan, but rather he has already joined the club and will make his debut soon.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Clarkson is joining St Mirren on loan, while the article states that he has already joined the club.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Clarkson is joining St Mirren on loan, when in fact he has already joined the club.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that St Mirren have signed forward Jeremy Clarkson on loan from Dundee until the end of the season.
2. However, the article states that the player in question is unnamed in the article, and there is no mention of Jeremy Clarkson. The article talks about a forward who joined Premiership Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship. The player's name is not provided.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which mentions Jeremy Clarkson, a well-known television presenter, in connection with a football transfer, which is not supported by the article's content.
