     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Jeremy Clarkson has signed for St Mirren on loan from Dundee until the end of the season, but the article states that he has joined Premiership Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut against Alloa on Saturday.
2. The summary mentions that Clarkson has scored nine goals for Dundee last season, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that he has featured mainly as a substitute this term.
3. The summary quotes Clarkson as saying "I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit", implying that he has been training with St Mirren, but the article states that he has joined Well for a second spell.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains inaccuracies and misleading information.
