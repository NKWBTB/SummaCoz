</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the organisers of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival have launched a new online festival. This is not consistent with the article, as the article is about the Hebridean Celtic Festival.
2. The article mentions that the festival is taking place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis from 19 to 22 July, while the summary does not provide any information about the location or dates of the festival.
3. The article mentions that the festival will feature acts such as The Waterboys, Imelda May, Lucy Spraggan, Skerryvore, Peatbog Faeries, and Dougie MacLean, while the summary does not mention any acts or performances.
4. The article mentions that the festival will offer an augmented reality experience, while the summary does not mention anything about augmented reality or interactive features.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary appears to be about the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, rather than the Hebridean Celtic Festival.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that "the organisers of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival have launched a new online festival."
2. However, the article discusses the Hebridean Celtic Festival (HebCelt) taking place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis from 19 to 22 July. There is no mention of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary providing information about a different festival (Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival) that is not discussed in the article, which focuses on HebCelt.
