    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the organisers of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival have launched a new online festival.

This is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival in the article. Instead, the article is about the Hebridean Celtic Festival.

2. The article mentions that visitors to the Hebridean Celtic Festival will be able to use an app to trigger online information from items such as signs and posters on the site.

This is not mentioned in the summary.

3. The article also mentions that videos and band interviews will be among the online material available to view on phones and tablets.

This is not mentioned in the summary.

4. The article takes place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis from 19 to 22 July.

This is not mentioned in the summary.

5. The article mentions the names of some of the acts performing at the festival, such as The Waterboys, Imelda May, Lucy Spraggan, Skerryvore, Peatbog Faeries, and Dougie MacLean.

This is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different festival (Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival) and does not include any of the specific details mentioned in the article about the Hebridean Celtic Festival.
