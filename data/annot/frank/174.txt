Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man, and of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.
2. The article also states that Weatherhogg was sentenced to six years in prison.
3. However, the summary states that a woman has been sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against a woman and a woman.
4. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Weatherhogg, a man, was found guilty of the offenses, not a woman.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.
