Economy passengers have long wished they were in first class with lie-flat beds and nice meals, but now it seems there is someone else to envy - the cabin crew. A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four different continents Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Pilots have their own separate sleeping quarters, such as this one, on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Looking out over the passengers: Cabin crew can keep an eye on everyone on the flight in case of any issues

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Key information missing: The summary does not mention the new plane design or the innovative features of the crew rest areas, such as the bunk beds and personal service units (PSUs) with in-flight entertainment and air conditioning systems. These key details are absent from the summary, which makes it incomplete and inaccurate.
2. Incorrect emphasis: The summary emphasizes that the crew rest areas are designed to feel spacious, private, and with maximum personal comfort, which is true. However, the article provides more information about the design and features of the crew rest areas, and the emphasis should be on these aspects rather than just the feeling of spaciousness and privacy.
3. Incorrect focus: The summary focuses solely on the crew rest areas, while the article provides a broader overview of the new plane design and the market research conducted by Zodiac Aerospace to create the new concept for sleeping areas. The summary should have included this information to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the article.
4. Incorrect language: The summary uses the phrase "giving staff a bed each," which is not accurate. The article uses the phrase "bunk beds" to describe the sleeping quarters for the crew, and the summary should have used the same language to maintain consistency.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits key information, emphasizes the wrong aspects, focuses on the wrong information, and uses incorrect language. To improve the summary, it should have included all the key details from the article, emphasized the innovative features of the crew rest areas, and used accurate language to maintain consistency with the original text.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Zodiac Galleys Europe has designed a new plane concept that provides staff with a bed each and some privacy for rest during long-haul flights. It mentions that the lower deck designs aim to feel spacious, private, and have an air conditioning system.
2. However, the article does not mention Zodiac Galleys Europe specifically. Instead, it mentions Zodiac Aerospace as the company that unveiled the new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew. The summary incorrectly attributes the design to Zodiac Galleys Europe instead of Zodiac Aerospace.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly names Zodiac Galleys Europe as the designer of the new plane concept, while the article states that Zodiac Aerospace revealed the designs.
