    Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive.

In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also knownÂ as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "UNK ring" but there is no mention of such a ring in the article. The article only talks about septum piercings, not UNK rings.
2. The summary states that the UNK ring is used for controlling and handling bulls, but there is no mention of this in the article. The article only discusses the use of septum piercings as a fashion trend and a status symbol in certain cultures.
3. The summary mentions that the UNK ring is used as a way of controlling and handling bulls, but this is not a correct statement. There is no evidence in the article to support the idea that septum piercings are used for this purpose.
4. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article discusses the trend of septum piercings among celebrities and in certain cultures, but it does not mention anything about controlling or handling bulls.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and misleading information. It is important to carefully read and understand the content of an article before creating a summary to ensure that the summary accurately reflects the content of the article.
