Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive.

In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also knownÂ as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "the wall between the two cheeks" being severed, but the article does not mention anything about the cheeks. The article only talks about the septum, which is the cartilage that separates the two nostrils.
2. The summary mentions the "UNK ring" being used to control and handle bulls, but the article does not mention anything about bulls or using the septum ring for that purpose. The article only talks about the septum ring being a fashion trend and a status symbol in certain cultures.
3. The summary is written in a way that suggests the septum ring is a new trend, but the article states that the septum ring has been around for years and has been worn by various cultures for different reasons.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
