Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Mayweather eats steamed white rice and chicken or beef broth at almost every meal, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article reveals that Mayweather has a strict diet and only eats food cooked and heated up on a stove or in an oven, and that he does not eat steamed white rice or beef broth.
2. The summary states that Manny Pacquiao eats five meals and consumes 8,000 calories daily, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that Pacquiao averages over 2,500 sit-ups daily during training camp and that he has a strict diet.
3. The summary does not mention that Mayweather has a guilty pleasure of playing Mega Touch and holding the highest scores in every game on there, or that he takes his food very seriously, or that he always orders a glass of hot water to let his silverware soak in the glass before using them. These are all unique details that are mentioned in the article.
4. The summary does not mention that Pacquiao has met with President Obama, President Clinton, and Prince Harry, or that he has a Lt Colonel rank in the reserve force of Philippine Army. These are all unique details that are mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not include all the information in the article and omits some of the unique details that are mentioned in the article. Therefore, it is not a consistent summary of the article.
