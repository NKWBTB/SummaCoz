    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the key points in the summary and article

Summary:

* St Mirren have signed Jack Clarkson on loan until the end of the season
* The option for a further 12 months is included in the loan deal

Article:

* Clarkson has joined Premiership club Well for a second spell
* He could make his St Mirren debut against Alloa on Saturday
* He has scored nine goals for Dundee last season and has been mainly used as a substitute this term
* Clarkson is fit and ready to play, having trained hard and kept his match fitness up
* St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa

Step 2: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary mentions that St Mirren have signed Jack Clarkson on loan until the end of the season, with the option of a further 12 months. However, the article does not mention anything about a loan deal or an option for a further 12 months. Instead, it states that Clarkson has joined Premiership club Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut against Alloa on Saturday.

Step 3: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies

The inconsistency between the summary and article is likely due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the information provided in the article. The article does mention that Clarkson has joined Well for a second spell, but it does not mention a loan deal or an option for a further 12 months. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a loan deal and an option for a further 12 months, which are not mentioned in the article. The article states that Clarkson has joined Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut against Alloa on Saturday, but it does not provide information about a loan deal or an option for a further 12 months.
