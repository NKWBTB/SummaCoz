He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US."Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit," Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said."He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director."The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: "I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him."Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: "Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him."Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Age: The summary states that Christopher Hogwood died at the age of 83, but the article does not mention his age.
2. Cause of Death: The summary only mentions that Hogwood died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, but the article provides more details about his death, stating that he died following a long illness.
3. Memorial Service: The summary mentions a memorial service to be held at a later date, but the article does not mention any such service.
4. Recordings: The summary does not mention any of Hogwood's famous recordings, such as the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.
5. Career Highlights: The summary does not mention any of Hogwood's notable career achievements, such as founding the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973, directing the academy across six continents for some 30 years, or his positions as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete or accurate picture of Christopher Hogwood's life and career, and is therefore not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Christopher Hogwood, the veteran classical music conductor, has died at the age of 83.
2. However, the article states that Christopher Hogwood has indeed passed away, but it does not mention his age at the time of his death. The summary incorrectly specifies his age as 83.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which includes specific information about Christopher Hogwood's age at the time of his death that is not present in the article.
