Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Ander Herrera's eyes were closed as he watched his goals in the window.
2. However, the article states that Herrera's eyes were shut when he scored his goals, but not when he was watching the window.
3. The article provides evidence that Herrera's eyes were shut when he scored his goals, such as the image of his goal for Spain's Under 20 side back in 2009, where his eyes are closed as he hits the back of the net.
4. The article also states that Herrera has a history of shooting with his eyes closed, as he has scored six of his seven goals without looking at the ball or the opposition's net.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Herrera's eyes were closed as he watched his goals in the window, while the article provides evidence that his eyes were shut when he scored his goals.
