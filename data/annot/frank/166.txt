We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen."Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome "might come today, it might come next week".There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was "more fight in her" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was "unpredictable" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: "I have watched her grow up on Skype."She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English."Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing."Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a "prisoner of conscience" who was being held for "peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association".Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: "Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release."

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, but the article states that she was sentenced to five years in prison.
2. The summary does not mention that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in solitary confinement since her arrest, as stated in the article.
3. The summary does not mention that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter, Gabriella, has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents, as stated in the article.
4. The summary does not mention that the appeal hearing was held in secret, as stated in the article.
5. The summary does not mention that Mr. Ratcliffe believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK, as stated in the article.
6. The summary does not mention that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail, as stated in the article.
7. The summary does not mention that Mr. Ratcliffe is trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter, as stated in the article.
8. The summary does not mention that Amnesty International UK has called Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe a "prisoner of conscience" and has called for her immediate release, as stated in the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the article's content. It omits several key details and does not convey the full scope of the situation.
