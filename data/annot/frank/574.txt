A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than £1,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work– even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman – who asked to remain anonymous – spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn £7 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about £100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the student turned to sex work because her student loan did not cover her rent.
2. However, the article states that the student tried various part-time jobs, such as working in a coffee shop, pub, and as a waitress, before turning to sex work.
3. The article also mentions that the student's family is not well off and cannot afford to help her much, which suggests that the student was not relying solely on her student loan for financial support.
4. Furthermore, the article states that the student's decision to turn to sex work was motivated by the need to afford a better place to live, as she was initially living in overcrowded and noisy student accommodation.
5. Therefore, it can be inferred that the student's decision to turn to sex work was not solely due to the failure of her student loan to cover her rent, but rather a result of a combination of financial struggles and the need for a more comfortable living situation.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions the student loan as the reason for the student's decision to turn to sex work, while the article provides additional context and reasons for her decision.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that a University of Swansea student turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent, and it didn't cover her housing, living expenses, food, books, and travel costs.
2. However, the article does not mention that the student is from the University of Swansea. Also, the article does not specify that the student's student loan failed to cover her housing, living expenses, food, books, and travel costs.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary attributes the story to a University of Swansea student and provides specific details about what the student loan did not cover, which are not supported by the article.
