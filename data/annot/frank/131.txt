    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.

This statement is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of convictions for sexually abusing gay men in the article. Instead, the article focuses on the proposed pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences.

2. The article states that the Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, which will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales.

This suggests that the proposed pardons will apply to men convicted of abolished sexual offences, not specifically to those convicted of sexually abusing gay men.

3. The article mentions that the motion in the assembly is expected to contain the same provisions and allow for pardons both posthumously and for living gay and bisexual men.

This further supports the conclusion that the proposed pardons will apply to a broader range of individuals than just those convicted of sexually abusing gay men.

4. The minister is quoted as saying that arrangements will be brought in "as soon as possible to ensure that there is equal treatment for gay and bisexual men here as for their counterparts in England and Wales."

This suggests that the proposed pardons are part of a broader effort to provide equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland, rather than being specifically targeted at those convicted of sexually abusing gay men.

Overall, based on the information provided in the article, it is not consistent with the summary statement that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year. Instead, the proposed pardons appear to be part of a broader effort to provide equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland.
