Thousands attended the early morning service at Hyde Park Corner and up to 400 people took part in a parade before the wreath-laying at the Cenotaph.Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.A service was also held at Westminster Abbey.The national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung as the service ended.The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, a year after the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Gallipoli.Since then, the services have become an important moment for thousands of expatriate and visiting New Zealanders and Australians, who honour the sacrifices of their countrymen and women in all wars.Addressing the crowds at the dawn service, Alexander Downer, Australian high commissioner to the UK, who also laid a wreath, said: "When we reflect on Anzac Day we imagine the Gallipoli landings, what it must have been like, at dawn on the water, in sight of that rugged shoreline - and a collectively held breath, a leaden silence about to be broken."We consider the enthusiasm, the courage, and the heroism of the Anzac troops - ordinary men fighting for God, King and empire, for their mates, for adventure, for a world without war."Members of veterans' associations, service and ex-service personal and their families took part in the parade at the Cenotaph.Crowds, including Australia and New Zealand ex-pats, lined the streets to watch the ceremony which featured prayers read by schoolchildren and the national anthems of all three countries.The eight-month campaign on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey was one of the bloodiest of the war and the allied operation was an attempt to force the Ottoman empire out of the war.

a day of celebrations has taken place in new zealand to mark the 70th anniversary of the gallipoli landings.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One, which was the Gallipoli landings.
2. The summary states that the day is being celebrated to mark the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.
3. The problem is that the Gallipoli landings took place 100 years ago, not 70 years ago. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The article does not mention any celebrations, only commemorations and services to honor the sacrifices of the soldiers.
5. The summary is not accurate because it implies that the day is being celebrated, whereas the article states that it is being commemorated.
6. The word "celebrations" in the summary is not supported by the article, which only mentions "services" and "commemorations".
7. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the day is being celebrated, whereas the article states that it is being commemorated.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that a day of celebrations has taken place in New Zealand to mark the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.
2. However, the article does not mention any celebration in New Zealand, and it is primarily focused on the Anzac Day commemorations in London, including a service at Hyde Park Corner, a parade, and wreath-laying at the Cenotaph. It provides historical context about Anzac Day, the significance of the Gallipoli landings, and the services in London.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary introducing a celebration in New Zealand and mentioning the 70th anniversary, which is not supported by the article's content. Anzac Day commemorates events from World War I, not a 70th-anniversary celebration.
