    Article: 
    Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkResearchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas.Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular.Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.(% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable)England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: "Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate."School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet."Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: "Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged."From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat."School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety."School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%.The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children. However, the article does not mention anything about parents eating lunches at school.
2. The summary mentions that children are more likely to try new foods at school than at home. However, the article does not support this claim. In fact, the article states that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home, which suggests the opposite.
3. The summary mentions that parents want their children to try new foods and increase the variety of foods in their diet. While this is mentioned in the article, it is not the main focus of the research. The article is actually about the popularity of different vegetables among children in England who eat school lunches.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes claims that are not supported by the research. The article focuses on the popularity of different vegetables among children in England who eat school lunches, while the summary makes claims about parents eating lunches at school and children trying new foods at school.
