</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children." This statement is not supported by the article. The article actually states that children who eat school lunches are more likely to try new foods than their parents.
2. The article states that "four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home." This suggests that children who eat school lunches are more open to trying new foods than their parents.
3. The summary does not provide any specific statistics or evidence to support the claim that parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children.
4. The article provides several reasons why children who eat school lunches are more likely to try new foods, including the desire to fit in with their peers and the availability of healthier options. These reasons do not apply to parents.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and is not an accurate representation of the research findings.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children, as suggested by a survey.
2. However, the article does not provide any information or data suggesting that parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children. The article primarily discusses children's experiences with school lunches, their willingness to try new foods, and the popularity of certain vegetables. It mentions parents giving packed lunches due to perceived fussiness but doesn't support the idea that parents are more likely to eat a meal than their children.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting information that is not supported by the article, creating a misrepresentation of the content.
