The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the toddler tumbled into the pit at 3 pm on Saturday, but the article states that the incident occurred between 10 to 12 feet and the child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene.

2. The summary states that the child was treated for a leg injury, but the article does not mention any specific injuries.

3. The summary states that Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director, said there is a strong chance charges will be pressed on Monday, but the article does not mention any charges being pressed.

4. The summary states that the exhibit was closed following the child's fall, but the article does not mention the exhibit being closed.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations compared to the original article. It is not a consistent summary of the events described in the article.
