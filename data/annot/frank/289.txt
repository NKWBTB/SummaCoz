    Summary: 
    hungary\'s deputy prime minister, he szijjarto, has called on the european commission to block eu laws against eu laws. 

    Article: 
    He told Reuters that the EU should not interfere with "domestic issues".He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights.The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law.Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros.Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months.Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: "No. Why should we?"These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues."The minister added that "my Polish colleague" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary.EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously.Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports.Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law.Hungary's Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest-based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines.Meanwhile, draft legislation on NGOs is expected to go before parliament soon.Human rights groups say it would stigmatise them as "foreign-backed" organisations.Last month, the deputy head of the bloc's executive Commission, Frans Timmermans, warned action would be taken in coming weeks if there were no positive developments.Hungary passes bill targeting Central European UniversityHungarian attack on George Soros prompts NGO angerThe university built to defend democracy

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Mr. Szijjarto called on the European Commission to block EU laws, but the article states that he said the EU should not interfere with "domestic issues." This is a contradictory message.
2. The summary implies that Mr. Szijjarto is in favor of blocking EU laws, but the article states that he is against the EU interfering with Hungary's "domestic issues." This implies that he is against blocking EU laws.
3. The summary mentions nothing about the specific issues that the EU objects to in Hungary, such as tight controls on asylum seekers, NGOs, and higher education. These issues are central to the article and the EU's objections to Hungary's policies.
4. The summary mentions Poland's support for Hungary, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that Mr. Szijjarto said his Polish colleague had made it clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary, but it does not provide any details about Poland's position on the issues at hand.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it presents a contradictory message and leaves out important details about the specific issues at hand.
