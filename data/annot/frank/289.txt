</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister, Zsolt Szijjártó, has called on the European Commission to block EU laws.
2. However, the article states that Szijjártó said the opposite, that the EU should not interfere with "domestic issues" and that Hungary will not backtrack on its controversial laws.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it misrepresents the position of Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister.

The reason for this inconsistency is likely that the summary writer misinterpreted or misrepresented the information in the article. The article states that Szijjártó said the EU should not interfere with domestic issues, but the summary writer interpreted this as Hungary calling on the EU to block laws, which is not what the article states.
