</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Inconsistent number of husbands: The summary states that the woman wed 10 men over 11 years, while the article states that she married 10 men over the course of 11 years.
2. Incorrect location: The summary states that the woman is from the "dominican republican," which is not a correct location. The article correctly states that she is from the Dominican Republic.
3. Inconsistent information about her children: The summary states that she lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest, while the article does not mention anything about her children.
4. Incorrect information about her arrest: The summary states that she was arrested in February, while the article states that she was arrested in November 2014.
5. Inconsistent information about her marriages: The summary states that she married six men in 2002, while the article states that she married eight men in 2002.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a poorly written and inaccurate summary of the article's content.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that an unidentified woman married 10 men over 11 years and charged a fee for her "services."
2. However, the article states that the woman in question is Lianna Barrientos, provides details about her background, the countries of her husbands, her legal troubles, and the potential national security implications of her actions.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary provides a very brief and incomplete overview of the article's content, omitting essential details and specifics about the case, including the woman's name, Lianna Barrientos.
