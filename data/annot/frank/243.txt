    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the prison is "frightened" after reports of people being thrown into the prison by drones in Essex.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about drones being used to throw people into the prison. Instead, it mentions that there have been numerous incidents of packages being hurled over the prison wall, and that one former inmate claimed drones were used to fly contraband goods "straight up to prison windows".
3. The article also states that the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions drones being used to throw people into the prison, which is not supported by the article.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
