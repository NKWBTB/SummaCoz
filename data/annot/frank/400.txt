    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the troll called Alexis a "gold digger," but the article does not mention this. Instead, the troll accused her of not having to work for what she has.
2. The summary says that Rickie Fowler called out the troll on Instagram, but the article states that he responded to the troll on the Golf Channel.
3. The summary mentions that the troll attempted to backtrack by offering Alexis congratulations for supporting herself, but this is not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary contains details that are not present in the article, and omits other important information that is included in the article. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
