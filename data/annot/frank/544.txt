The provided summary is not consistent with the article because it only includes a few points from the article and omits many other important details. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary only includes three points from the article:
	* Ramen noodle soup is one of Floyd Mayweather's favorite snacks.
	* He doesn't like five-star restaurants.
	* He averages over 1000 sit-ups a day during training camp.
2. The article provides many more details about the fighters' preferences and habits, which are not included in the summary. For example:

	* The article states that Manny Pacquiao eats five meals and consumes 8,000 calories daily to keep his weight and energy up, but this is not mentioned in the summary.
	* The article highlights that Manny Pacquiao is a big photography buff and has purchased two Canon flagship cameras, but this is not included in the summary.
3. The summary is too brief and lacks important information. The article provides a wealth of information about the fighters' lives, training habits, and preferences, but the summary only scratches the surface.
4. The summary does not accurately reflect the tone and style of the article. The article is written in a lighthearted and playful tone, with a focus on the unique and interesting aspects of the fighters' lives. The summary, on the other hand, is too concise and lacks the same level of personality and humor.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only includes a few points from the article, omits many other important details, and lacks the same tone and style as the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao go head-to-head in Las Vegas on Saturday, May 2. The two boxers have revealed a dozen oddities about themselves in the build-up to the mega fight. Ramen noodle soup is one of Mayweather's favorite snacks, and he doesn't like five-star restaurants.
2. However, the article provides additional details about the oddities of both Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. The summary only mentions Mayweather's preferences, omitting information about Pacquiao's oddities and focusing on specific details about Mayweather.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that both Mayweather and Pacquiao have revealed oddities, but it only presents details about Mayweather, excluding information about Pacquiao's preferences and habits.
