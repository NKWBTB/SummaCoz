    Summary: 
    a collection of items worth up to # [UNK] has been put up for sale at a museum in staffordshire. 

    Article: 
    About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday."Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news"."The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that a collection of items worth up to # [UNK] has been put up for sale at a museum in Staffordshire, but the article does not mention any specific number or value of items being sold.
2. The summary mentions that the collection will be sold to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt, but the article states that the collection will remain on display at the museum and will be loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.
3. The summary does not mention the involvement of the Art Fund or the Victoria and Albert Museum, which are key players in the article's account of the sale.
4. The summary does not mention the high court judge's ruling that the collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund, which is a significant aspect of the article's account of the sale.
5. The summary does not mention Tristram Hunt MP's involvement in the campaign, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide an accurate representation of the article's content and is not consistent with the information provided.
