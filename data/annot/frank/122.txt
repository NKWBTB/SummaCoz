    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that a new power station is being built in Brighton, but the article does not mention anything about a new power station being built in Brighton. Instead, the article talks about the redevelopment of the existing Fawley Power Station site in Southampton.
2. The summary mentions that the power station will create a new power station in Brighton, but the article does not mention anything about a new power station being built in Brighton. Instead, the article talks about the redevelopment of the existing Fawley Power Station site in Southampton.
3. The summary states that the power station will be the centrepiece of a "merchant city" development, but the article does not mention anything about a "merchant city" development. Instead, the article talks about the redevelopment of the existing Fawley Power Station site in Southampton featuring a marina, housing, and restaurants.
4. The summary mentions that the power station will be built in 2018, but the article does not mention anything about a specific construction start date. Instead, the article states that an application for outline planning permission is due later this year.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations about the redevelopment of the Fawley Power Station site in Southampton.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions construction work starting on a new power station in Brighton.
2. However, the article does not provide any information about construction work in Brighton related to a new power station. The article primarily discusses the disused Fawley power station and its potential redevelopment.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary introducing information about a new power station in Brighton, which is not mentioned in the article.
