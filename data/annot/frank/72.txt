    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Dame Sarah Storey won her second UCI road cycling world championships title.

However, the article does not mention any information about her winning a second title. Instead, it states that she won her first UCI road cycling world championship title in 2014.

2. The summary also mentions that Storey won a 17th title when she rode in Saturday's road race, but the article does not mention anything about her winning any additional titles beyond the one she won in 2014.

3. The article does mention that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the summary does not mention anything about the Paralympics or Rio de Janeiro.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article, such as Storey winning a second title and targeting the Paralympics.
