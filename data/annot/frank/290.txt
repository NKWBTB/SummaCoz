<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Hungary's president, Michel Szijjarto, has warned that Hungary could refrain from withdrawing three laws related to asylum seekers.
2. However, the article states that Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw these laws, and that the government has already passed two of the laws.
3. The article also mentions that the EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and NGOs, and that the government's actions have raised serious questions about compatibility with EU law.
4. Therefore, it is inconsistent for Hungary's president to warn about refraining from withdrawing the laws when the government has already passed two of them and is facing pressure from the EU to withdraw them.
5. Additionally, the summary does not mention the EU's objections to the laws or the government's actions, which is a significant aspect of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article and omits important information.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Hungary's President Michel Szijjarto warned that Hungary could refrain from making attempts to withdraw three laws for asylum seekers.
2. However, the article does not mention Hungary's President Michel Szijjarto. Instead, it refers to Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Peter Szijjarto, expressing Hungary's reluctance to backtrack on the mentioned laws. The article discusses Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and its objections to specific EU objections, such as tight controls on asylum seekers, regulations on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and a higher education law.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, attributing statements to a non-existent "President Michel Szijjarto" and misattributing the statements to the wrong Hungarian official.
