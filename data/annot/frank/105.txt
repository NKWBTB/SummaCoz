    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Sutton United has agreed a deal to sign midfielder Akil Wright on a two-year deal. However, the article does not mention anything about Wright signing a two-year deal. Instead, it mentions that the "finer points" of a deal that could see Wright become a club director have yet to be released.
2. The summary also states that Wright will become a club director, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it mentions that Wright will become a director if the deal goes through.
3. The summary mentions that Billericay are eighth in the Isthmian League Premier Division, but the article does not mention the team's current league position.
4. The summary states that Wright played non-league football for a succession of clubs, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it mentions that Wright was runner-up in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2011.
5. The summary does not mention that the club has been taken over by a multi-millionaire, as stated in the article.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Sutton United has signed Akil Wright on a two-year deal.
2. However, the article states that Akil Wright potentially purchases 20% of Billericay and becomes a club director.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests that Akil Wright has signed with Sutton United on a two-year deal, while the article discusses Akil Wright's potential involvement with Billericay Football Club and becoming a club director.
