    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ed Sheerin has been appointed Aberdeen's manager on a two-year contract after agreeing a one-year deal with Arbroath.

This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Sheerin has been player-manager at Arbroath since 2010, and that he has replaced Neil Cooper at Pittodrie. It does not mention a one-year deal with Arbroath.

2. The summary also states that Arbroath were relegated to Scottish League Two after finishing the 2013-14 season bottom of League One.

This is consistent with the article, which states that Arbroath were relegated to Scottish League Two after finishing the 2013-14 season bottom of League One.

3. The summary states that Sheerin played for several Scottish clubs and also featured for Östersunds in Sweden before moving into coaching.

This is consistent with the article, which states that Sheerin played for several Scottish clubs and also featured for Östersunds in Sweden before moving into coaching.

4. The summary states that Sheerin guided Arbroath to their first national trophy in their history by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011.

This is consistent with the article, which states that Sheerin guided Arbroath to their first national trophy in their history by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a one-year deal with Arbroath, which is not present in the article.
