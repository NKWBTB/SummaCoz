<Summary>
more than half of parents in england are eating eating sweets, a study has found.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the survey found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. This means that the majority of children are trying new foods at school, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that more than half of parents in England are eating sweets.
2. The article also states that half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. This suggests that the children are trying new foods at school and then asking for them to be made at home, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that parents are eating sweets.
3. The article does not mention anything about parents eating sweets or the popularity of sweets among parents or children. The only mention of sweets is in the summary, which is not supported by the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a misleading or inaccurate summary of the research findings.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that more than half of parents in England are eating sweets, according to a study.
2. However, the article does not contain information about parents in England eating sweets. Instead, it discusses a survey regarding children's eating habits, school lunches, and their willingness to try new foods. The survey mentions popular vegetables among children and the shift in school meal options.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary misrepresenting the content of the article by introducing the idea of parents in England eating sweets, which is not supported by the article.
