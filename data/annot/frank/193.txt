     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "more than half of parents in England are eating sweets," but the article does not mention anything about parents eating sweets. The article only discusses children's eating habits and their preferences for certain vegetables.
2. The summary implies that the study found that parents are eating sweets, but the article actually states that the study found that children are trying new foods at school, such as vegetables, and that parents are asking their children to try these foods at home.
3. The summary mentions nothing about the survey finding that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried foods they had not tried at home, which is a key finding of the article.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the survey found that parents are asking their children to try new foods at home, which is another important finding of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the findings of the survey and focuses on a different topic (parents eating sweets) rather than the main findings of the article (children trying new foods at school and parents asking them to try new foods at home).
