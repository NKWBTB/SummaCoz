     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Dame Barbara Kemp is returning to EastEnders for the final time in more than a decade. However, the article states that her character will be killed off in the spring.
2. The summary mentions that Grant Mitchell will return to bring the Mitchell family back together. However, the article does not mention anything about Grant returning. Instead, it focuses on Dame Barbara's character dying from cancer.
3. The summary mentions that Grant was involved in repeated family dramas, including having an affair with his brother's wife and having his brother marry his ex-wife. However, these details are not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not mentioned in the article, and omits other important details that are mentioned in the article.
