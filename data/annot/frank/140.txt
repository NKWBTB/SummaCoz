Sir Peter Blake, who is now the prize's patron, won the junior title in 1961.

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that artist Alan Simpson has won this year's John Moores John Moores painting, which is not true. According to the article, Simpson won the John Moores Painting Prize, not the John Moores John Moores painting.
2. The summary mentions that Simpson has won the prize "this year," which implies that the prize was awarded in 2023, while the article states that the prize was awarded in 2019.
3. The summary does not accurately describe the prize that Simpson won. According to the article, Simpson won £25,000 for his painting "Squint (19)," while the summary does not mention the prize amount or the specific painting that Simpson won for.
4. The summary does not accurately quote the judge Ansel Krut, who said that Simpson's piece was "quite extraordinary" and "a little bit like a tone poem." The summary only mentions that the judge said the painting was "difficult to look at."

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that alter the meaning of the original text.
