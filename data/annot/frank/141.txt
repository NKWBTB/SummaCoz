Sir Peter Blake, who is now the prize's patron, won the junior title in 1961.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that one of the world's most prestigious paintings has been awarded the prize, but the article does not mention anything about the painting being prestigious.
2. The summary mentions that the artist received the £25,000 prize, but the article only mentions that the artist received the prize money without specifying the amount.
3. The summary states that the artist won the prize for a painting called "Squint (19)", but the article does not mention the name of the painting.
4. The summary mentions that the artist has been shortlisted for the prize on three other occasions, but the article does not mention this information.
5. The summary quotes the judge as saying that the painting is "quite extraordinary" and "a little bit like a tone poem", but the article does not include these quotes.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other information that is present in the article.
