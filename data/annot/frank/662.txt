    Article: 
    Greater Manchester Police tweeted a warning about wasting time after a holidaymaker walked into a station to complain about his trip. The 44-year-old from Oldham decided had just returned from Algeria and wanted to complain about the temperatures he experienced during his holiday. Police tweeted the anecdote after the man tried to lodge an official complaint at the Great Manchester Police Chadderton division. Great Manchester Police Chadderton division revealed a man lodged a complaint that the weather on his holiday was 'too hot' The incident was shared by the police press office on its Facebook page, along with a warning that members of the public should not waste police time. There was a warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline Travel: 'The male was advised that this was not a police problem.' Following the post being shared on Facebook, there were mixed reactions to the man's actions. Janine Gamblen wrote: 'Some people really are just stupid,' while Sarah Edwards added: 'Only in Oldham.' The 44-year-old man had recently returned to the UK from a holiday in Algeria (file photo) 'The mind boggles,' commented Tracy Ayre while Suzi Force believes the man should have been punished, saying: 'Give him a holiday in a cell, maybe he will think twice next time!' However, Joanne Parker made light of the incident writing: 'Haha funny...would love to have seen the police face.' The current temperatures in Algeria is 28C, and this has remained fairly constant over the last week or two. Temperatures are set to peak at 25C over the next three days in England, however the north will see slightly lower temperatures than the south. It's not known if the Oldham man travelled to the Sahara Desert in Algeria, where he would undoubtedly have been 'hot' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the man from Oldham complained about the temperatures he experienced during his holiday in Algeria, but the article does not mention anything about the man complaining about the temperatures. Instead, the article states that the man tried to lodge an official complaint with the police because the weather on his holiday was "too hot."
2. The summary mentions that the police shared the post on their Facebook page, warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. However, the article does not mention anything about the police sharing the post on their Facebook page or warning the public about the offence.
3. The summary states that the man was advised that this was not a police problem, but the article does not mention anything about the police advising the man that his complaint was not a police problem. Instead, the article states that the police tweeted the anecdote as a warning to the public not to waste their time.
4. The summary mentions that the man had just returned from Algeria, but the article does not mention anything about the man having just returned from Algeria. Instead, the article states that the man tried to lodge an official complaint with the police after returning from his holiday.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that the man complained about the temperatures, but the article does not mention anything about the man complaining. Additionally, the summary mentions that the police shared the post on their Facebook page and warned the public about the offence, but the article does not mention anything about the police sharing the post or warning the public.
