The 44-year-old from Oldham decided had just returned from Algeria and wanted to complain about the temperatures he experienced during his holiday. Police tweeted the anecdote after the man tried to lodge an official complaint at the Great Manchester Police Chadderton division. Great Manchester Police Chadderton division revealed a man lodged a complaint that the weather on his holiday was 'too hot' The incident was shared by the police press office on its Facebook page, along with a warning that members of the public should not waste police time. There was a warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline Travel: 'The male was advised that this was not a police problem.'

The 44-year-old man had recently returned to the UK from a holiday in Algeria (file photo) 'The mind boggles,' commented Tracy Ayre while Suzi Force believes the man should have been punished, saying: 'Give him a holiday in a cell, maybe he will think twice next time!' However, Joanne Parker made light of the incident writing: 'Haha funny...would love to have seen the police face.' The current temperatures in Algeria is 28C, and this has remained fairly constant over the last week or two.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man from Oldham complained about the temperatures he experienced during his holiday in Algeria.
2. However, the article states that the man complained about the weather being "too hot" during his holiday, not the temperatures.
3. The summary does not mention the man's complaint being about the weather, only that he complained about the temperatures.
4. The article states that the Great Manchester Police Chadderton division shared the post on their Facebook page as a warning not to waste police time, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The summary does not provide any information about the current temperatures in Algeria or England, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the man's complaint or the context of the situation. The summary only provides a brief and incomplete summary of the article's content, and omits important details that are included in the article.
