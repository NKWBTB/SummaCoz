    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a man was charged with drinking alcohol and causing the death of a woman, but the article does not mention any death or any charges related to that.
2. The article only mentions charges of allowing the consumption of liquor outside licensing hours against the license holder, Colleen O'Neill, and another person, James Thomas.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a death and charges related to that, but the article only mentions charges related to licensing hours and no death.
4. The article does mention that the premises had not been run in a proper manner and that the judge expressed concern about the license holder's record, but this is not the same as causing the death of a woman.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article.
