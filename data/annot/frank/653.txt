Spain's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday brought back bitter memories of their disastrous 2014 World Cup, but coach Vicente del Bosque will not be too worried about a third straight friendly defeat, insists Gerard Pique. Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters. 'We have a very clear idea of our playing style and we are able to count on people who are gradually making a place for themselves in the team.'

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Spain lost 2-0 to Holland, but the article states that Spain lost 2-0 to Holland in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup, not in a friendly match on Tuesday.
2. The summary states that Gerard Pique scored two goals in the second half, but there is no mention of Pique scoring any goals in the article.
3. The summary states that Vicente del Bosque will not be punished for a third straight defeat, but the article does not mention anything about del Bosque being punished or worried about the defeat.
4. The summary states that Spain lost the match, but the article states that Spain fielded a largely experimental, second-string team and that the defeat was not a cause for concern for del Bosque.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains errors and inaccuracies, such as the incorrect mention of Pique scoring goals and the implication that del Bosque is worried about the defeat, which are not supported by the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Gerard Pique scored two goals in the second half in the group stage of the match, which is not accurate.
2. However, the article states that Gerard Pique did not score any goals in the match against Holland, and it does not mention any goals by Gerard Pique in the group stage.
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the error that suggests Gerard Pique scored two goals in the second half, which is not supported by the article.
