Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future.

Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Emmanuel Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City on loan. However, the article states that he initially joined on loan before making the switch permanent for £5million the following summer.
2. The summary does not mention Adebayor's inconsistent form or the rise of Harry Kane, which are significant factors in the article that explain why Adebayor's future at Tottenham is uncertain.
3. The summary states that Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but the article mentions that he has only one year left on his current contract at Tottenham.
4. The summary does not mention the video of Adebayor dancing in front of the Arc de Triomphe, which is a significant detail in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details and does not accurately convey the main points of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Emmanuel Adebayor has one year left on his current contract at White Hart Lane, joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City on loan, and posted a video of himself dancing in the Arc de Triomphe.
2. However, the article mentions that Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 initially on loan, and after an impressive first season, the club made the switch permanent for £5 million the following summer. The article does not specify the remaining duration of Adebayor's contract. Additionally, while the article talks about Adebayor's recent bizarre dance video in front of the Arc de Triomphe, it does not mention any specific details about his contract status.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary states specific details about Adebayor's contract duration and loan status that are not explicitly mentioned or confirmed in the article.
