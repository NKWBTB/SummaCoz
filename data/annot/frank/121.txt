    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that plans for a disused power station in Southampton have been given the go-ahead by the government. However, the article does not mention any approval or go-ahead from the government. Instead, it discusses the developers' plans for the site and the potential for a signature piece of infrastructure.
2. The summary mentions that the power station has been disused for four years, which is not consistent with the article's statement that the power station closed in 2013 after more than 40 years in operation.
3. The summary states that the development will feature a marina, housing, and restaurants, but the article does not mention these details. Instead, it focuses on the potential for a signature piece of infrastructure and the history of the power station.
4. The summary mentions fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth, but the article does not mention any ferry links.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as government approval and specific features of the development. Additionally, some of the details in the summary are not accurate, such as the length of time the power station has been disused.
