(CNN)Buzz has surrounded HBO's new documentary "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief," but Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, "and I don't really care to." "I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative," Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, "The Forger," in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book "Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of "people who were disgruntled with their experiences" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. "I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?" Travolta asked. "It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine." He called Scientology "brilliant" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009. "Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it," said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member. "Honestly."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that John Travolta is not a fan of the HBO documentary "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief."
2. However, the article states that Travolta has not seen the documentary and has no intention of doing so.
3. The summary implies that Travolta is not a fan of the documentary because it is critical of the Church of Scientology, but the article does not support this claim.
4. In fact, the article quotes Travolta as saying that he has been "so happy" with his experience in Scientology over the past 40 years and has no reason to speak negatively about it.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Travolta is not a fan of the documentary due to its critical stance on Scientology, when in fact he has not seen the documentary and has only positive things to say about his experience with the church.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that in the HBO documentary "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief," Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta says he has not seen the documentary, and he doesn't really care to. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's members, is premiering his new film, "The Forger," in Clearwater, Florida. Travolta thought the documentary was a factor.
2. However, the article provides more context about John Travolta's views on the HBO documentary. It mentions that Travolta has not seen the documentary and doesn't really care to. It also talks about his positive experiences with Scientology, his belief that the documentary is a result of people who were disgruntled with their experiences, and his praise for Scientology as "brilliant." The summary introduces information about Travolta's new film, "The Forger," premiering in Clearwater, Florida, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary adds information about Travolta's new film and mentions that he thought the documentary was a factor, which is not supported by the article.
