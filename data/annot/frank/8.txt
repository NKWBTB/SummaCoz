     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Jeremy Clarkson has signed for St Mirren on a season-long loan from Dundee, but the article states that he has joined Premiership Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut against Alloa on Saturday.

Step 2: The summary does not mention that Clarkson has already joined Well and has been playing for them this season. The article reveals that he has been playing for Well and has featured mainly as a substitute.

Step 3: The summary states that Clarkson is ready to play for St Mirren and is match fit, but the article quotes him as saying that he has been training hard and making sure he is up to speed with everyone else.

Step 4: The summary does not mention Clarkson's international career or his previous clubs, while the article provides this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. It contains incorrect information about Clarkson's current club and his readiness to play for St Mirren, and it omits important information about his international career and previous clubs.
