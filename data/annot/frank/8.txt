</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that St Mirren has signed Jeremy Clarkson on a season-long loan from Dundee.
2. However, the article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
3. This implies that Clarkson has already joined another club, Premiership Well, and is not on a season-long loan from Dundee to St Mirren.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Clarkson has been signed by St Mirren on a season-long loan, while the article states that he has already joined another club.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Clarkson has been signed by St Mirren on a season-long loan, when in fact he has already joined another club.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that St Mirren has signed striker Jeremy Clarkson on a season-long loan from Dundee.
2. However, the article does not mention any transfer of Jeremy Clarkson to St Mirren. Instead, the article discusses a player named Clarkson (without specifying the first name) who joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship. The player in question appears to be a footballer, not the well-known TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary assumes Jeremy Clarkson, the TV presenter, has been signed by St Mirren, while the article discusses a different individual who is a footballer.
