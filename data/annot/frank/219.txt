Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the Liberal Democrats spent £1,580,575 on their campaign, which is significantly less than £1 billion.
2. The article also states that the Liberal Democrats lost all but one of their MEPs, which suggests that their campaign was not successful.
3. The summary, on the other hand, claims that the Liberal Democrats spent more than £1 billion in the first three months of the 2015 general election. This is not supported by the article, as the article only provides information on the campaign expenditure for the European election, not the general election.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it provides incorrect information about the Liberal Democrats' campaign spending.
