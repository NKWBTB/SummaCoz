We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen."Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome "might come today, it might come next week".There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was "more fight in her" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was "unpredictable" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: "I have watched her grow up on Skype."She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English."Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing."Mr Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.Amnesty International UK said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a "prisoner of conscience" who was being held for "peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association".Risk campaign manager Kathy Voss added: "Though she shouldn't even find herself in this awful position, we very much hope the appeal will rule in Nazanin's favour and order her immediate release."

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband has called on the government to appeal against her conviction, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article states that the appeal is happening in "secret" and that the family does not know when to expect a result.
2. The summary mentions that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail, but the article states that she was sentenced in September, but the charges have not been disclosed.
3. The summary states that the appeal hearing is happening in Tehran, but the article does not mention the location of the appeal.
4. The summary mentions that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has spent time in solitary confinement, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that the family does not know when to expect a result from the appeal, but the article states that the final outcome "might come today, it might come next week".

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.
