A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded.Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win.The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties.More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up.However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break.Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.Gloucester: Marshall; Sharples, Trinder, Twelvetrees, May; Burns, Heinz (capt); McAllister, Hibbard, Hohneck, Savage, Thrush, Moriarty, Rowan, Morgan.Replacements: Matu'u, Thomas, Afoa, Galarza, Ludlow, Braley, Atkinson, Purdy.Cardiff Blues: Morgan; Cuthbert, Lee-Lo, Shingler, Scully; Anscombe, Williams; Jenkins (capt), Dacey, Filise, Earle, Hoeata, Warburton, Navidi, Williams.Replacements: Rees, Domachowski, Assiratti, Cook, Bennett, Williams, Halaholo, Summerhill.Referee: Pascal Gauzere (France)For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.

<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Gloucester maintained a 100% start to the European Champions Cup, which is not consistent with the article. The article states that Gloucester won the game 23-20, but the summary suggests that they maintained a 100% start, which implies a perfect record, which is not accurate.
2. The article states that Gloucester won the game 23-20, but the summary does not provide any information about the score. Instead, it focuses on Gloucester's perfect start to the European Champions Cup, which is not supported by the article.
3. The article mentions that Gloucester won the game with four second-half tries, but the summary does not provide any information about the tries or the second half of the game. Instead, it focuses on Gloucester's perfect start to the European Champions Cup.
4. The article mentions that Cardiff Blues failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010, but the summary does not provide any information about the opposition or the competition. Instead, it focuses on Gloucester's perfect start to the European Champions Cup.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it focuses on Gloucester's perfect start to the European Champions Cup, which is not supported by the article. The article provides more detailed information about the game, including the score, the tries, and the opposition, but the summary does not provide any of this information.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states, "Gloucester maintained their 100% start to the European Champions Cup with a bonus-point win."
2. However, the article does not mention the European Champions Cup, nor does it confirm or provide information about Gloucester's 100% start in this competition. The article discusses a rugby match between Cardiff Blues and Gloucester, detailing the events and scores during the game.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary making a specific claim about Gloucester's performance in the European Champions Cup, which is not supported or addressed in the article. The article focuses primarily on the match itself.
