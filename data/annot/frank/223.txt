</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Torquay United have signed former Port Vale striker James Keatings on a two-and-a-half-year deal.
2. However, the article does not mention any mention of James Keatings or a two-and-a-half-year deal.
3. The article does mention a striker named Myles Keating, who has joined Torquay United on a two-and-a-half-year deal, subject to international clearance.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions James Keatings, while the article mentions Myles Keating.
5. Additionally, the summary mentions a two-and-a-half-year deal, while the article mentions a two-and-a-half-year deal subject to international clearance, which suggests that the summary may not be accurate in terms of the length of the contract.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different player (James Keatings instead of Myles Keating) and the length of the contract (two-and-a-half-years instead of subject to international clearance).
