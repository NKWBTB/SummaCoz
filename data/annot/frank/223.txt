     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "torquay united" signing "former port vale striker james keatings", but the article does not mention anything about Torquay United signing a striker named James Keatings. Instead, the article talks about the club signing a center-back named Myles Anderson and a striker named Ruairi Keating.
2. The summary mentions a two-and-a-half-year deal, but the article does not provide any information about the length of the contract.
3. The summary mentions James Keatings as a former Port Vale striker, but the article does not mention anything about Port Vale or any other club that James Keatings has played for.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different player (James Keatings) and a different club (Torquay United) than the article does. Additionally, the summary provides information that is not present in the article (the length of the contract and James Keatings' previous club).
