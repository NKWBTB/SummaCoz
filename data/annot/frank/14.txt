    Summary: 
    a new pension scheme to restore bernard matthews\'s chicken and chicken has been given guarantees by the unite union. 

    Article: 
    The turkey firm was sold to the food tycoon Ranjit Boparan on Tuesday.There had been fears that the new owners would not take on the existing workers' pension scheme.But Unite regional officer Steve Harley said: "We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured."Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover.The Boparan Private Office, the "chicken king" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.Mr Harley met with representatives from Boparan at the Great Witchingham headquarters.He said: "It was made clear that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business."This would be achieved by greater investment in the business, cost savings and utilising the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just turkeys." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions a "new pension scheme" for Bernard Matthews, but the article does not mention any such scheme.
2. The article states that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews will continue under the new ownership, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The summary mentions that the new owners will "restore" Bernard Matthews to its former position, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the new owners wish to achieve this through greater investment, cost savings, and utilizing present spare capacity.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a new pension scheme, which is not mentioned in the article, and it also uses language that is not found in the article (e.g. "restore").

Overall, it appears that the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions a new pension scheme to restore Bernard Matthews' chicken and chicken with guarantees from the Unite union.
2. However, the article does not provide any information about a new pension scheme related to chicken restoration. It focuses on the continuity of existing pension arrangements and the new owner's plans to make the business more profitable through investments and cost savings.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary implying the introduction of a new pension scheme for chicken restoration, while the article does not mention it.
