    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that police are releasing CCTV footage of a man they want to trace, implying that the man in the footage is a suspect in the disappearance of Trevor Deely.
2. However, the article states that the man in the CCTV footage has not yet been identified, and that detectives are still appealing for him to come forward. This suggests that the man in the footage is not a suspect, but rather a person of interest who may have information about Trevor Deely's disappearance.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the man in the CCTV footage is a suspect, while the article states that he is not yet identified and is being appealed for information.
