    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the victim was shot in a Sheffield street, but the article does not mention where the shooting took place. The article only mentions that the victim was found with a gunshot wound to his chest outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe.
2. The summary states that the victim was driving a black Mercedes car when he was shot, but the article does not mention anything about the victim being in a car.
3. The summary states that the victim died from his injuries, but the article only says that he was taken to Northern General hospital. It does not mention whether he died or not.
4. The summary mentions that there have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, but the article only mentions three specific incidents: the shooting of a 25-year-old man in the Shiregreen area, shots being fired through an elderly couple's living room window in the Southey Green area, and shots being fired at houses in two separate incidents in the High Green area. The article does not mention any other shootings in Sheffield.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not mentioned in the article, and leaves out other important details that are mentioned in the article.
