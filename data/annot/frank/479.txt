    Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements. Adebayor has only one year left to run on his current contract at Tottenham and could leave this summer Adebayor sees a shot saved by Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan (left) during the match in November Adebayor recently insisted that he was prepared to fight for his place in the Tottenham team The form of Spurs academy graduate Harry Kane (left) has seen Adebayor pushed down the pecking order Adebayor poses for a photo on Instagram as the the striker takes a break in Paris

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Adebayor posted a bizarre video on his Instagram account, but the article does not mention any such video.
2. The summary mentions that Adebayor has one year left on his contract, but the article states that he has one year left on his current contract at White Hart Lane.
3. The summary states that Adebayor has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle in October, but the article does not mention any specific time frame for his goal drought.
4. The summary mentions that Adebayor sees a shot saved by Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan during a match in November, but the article does not mention any such match.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other information that is present in the article.
