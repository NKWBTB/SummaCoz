Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Inconsistent language usage:

In the summary, the word "inconsistent" is used to describe Adebayor's form, but the word "bizarre" is used to describe the video he posted on Instagram. The article does not use the word "bizarre" to describe the video, instead describing it as a "strange jig." Using inconsistent language can make the summary seem less objective and more sensationalized.

2. Incorrect information:

The summary states that Adebayor has one year left on his contract, but the article states that he has one year left on his current contract, which is not the same as saying he has one year left on his overall contract. This small difference in wording can lead to confusion and inaccuracy.

3. Lack of context:

The summary does not provide any context for the video Adebayor posted on Instagram. The article explains that the video was taken in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but the summary does not include this information. Providing context can help readers better understand the situation and why Adebayor might have posted the video.

4. Overemphasis on a single aspect:

The summary focuses primarily on the video Adebayor posted on Instagram, while the article provides a more balanced view of Adebayor's situation, including his inconsistent form and the rise of Harry Kane. Overemphasizing a single aspect can make the summary seem less comprehensive and less balanced.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because of inconsistent language usage, incorrect information, lack of context, and overemphasis on a single aspect. To improve the summary, it should be rewritten to provide a more balanced and comprehensive view of the article's content, using consistent language and providing context where necessary.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Emmanuel Adebayor recently posted a bizarre video on his official Instagram account, just a few days after he took to Twitter to insist that he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. It also suggests that Adebayor has one year left on his current contract, but his inconsistent form has raised uncertainties about his future.
2. However, the article does not provide information about Adebayor posting a bizarre video on Instagram or making recent Twitter statements insisting on fighting for his place. It also does not mention specific details about Adebayor's contract status or uncertainties about his future. The summary includes information not present in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary introduces details about Adebayor's recent social media activity, contract status, and uncertainties about his future that are not supported by the article.
