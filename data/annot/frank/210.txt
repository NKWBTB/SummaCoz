There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Scottish government has been accused of "no magic bullet" in the system of a tax on the system.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the Scottish government being accused of this. Instead, it discusses the findings of a review on local tax reform, which highlighted the challenges of reforming the current system.
3. The review, conducted by Prof Kenneth Gibb, found that there is no "magic bullet" to cure the defects in the current system, and that any reform would be a major undertaking.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it misrepresents the content of the article by attributing a statement to the Scottish government that is not present in the article.

Overall, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article and is misleading. It is important to carefully read and understand the content of an article before summarizing it to avoid misrepresenting the information.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that the Scottish government has been accused of lacking a "magic bullet" in the tax system.
2. However, the article does not make an accusation against the Scottish government. It primarily discusses a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform and its findings about the council tax system in Scotland. The review suggests that there is no "magic bullet" to solve the problems in the tax system but does not make any accusations against the Scottish government.
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of an accusation that is not supported by the article's content. The article focuses on the findings of the review and the challenges of reforming the tax system rather than making accusations against the government.
