     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the site of a former power station in the Solent is set to be turned into a former oil chimney site, but the article does not mention anything about the site being turned into a former oil chimney site. Instead, the article discusses plans to develop the site into a "merchant city" with a glass structure, marina, housing, and restaurants.
2. The summary mentions that the power station closed in 2013, but the article states that the power station was commissioned in 1971, which is not consistent with the closure date mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary does not mention the architectural plans for the development, but the article provides detailed information about the plans, including the design of the glass structure and the features of the development.
4. The summary does not mention the cost of the development or the fact that the development is expected to start in 2018, but the article provides this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary contains inaccuracies and omissions that make it inconsistent with the article.
