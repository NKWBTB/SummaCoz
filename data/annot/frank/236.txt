</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives.
2. The article mentions that new inquests into the disaster concluded that the fans had been unlawfully killed, and that files of evidence relating to 23 suspects were referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought.
3. The summary states that six people have been charged in connection with the Hillsborough disaster.
4. However, the article does not mention any charges being brought against specific individuals. Instead, it mentions that the CPS will decide whether charges should be brought against 23 suspects.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that six people have been charged, while the article only mentions that the CPS will decide whether charges should be brought.
6. It is possible that the summary was written based on previous information or rumors about the Hillsborough disaster, but it is not supported by the information in the article.
7. The article emphasizes that the CPS will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives, which suggests that any charges brought against individuals will be the result of a careful consideration of the evidence and not based on speculation or hearsay.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that six people have been charged, while the article only mentions that the CPS will decide whether charges should be brought. The article emphasizes the careful consideration of evidence by the CPS, which suggests that any charges brought against individuals will be based on a thorough investigation and not on speculation or hearsay.
