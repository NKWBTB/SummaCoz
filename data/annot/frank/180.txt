    Summary: 
    barcelona say they have received a " substantial " tax claim over the signing of neymar from barcelona last month. 

    Article: 
    However the Spanish champions insisted they had not committed any offence."The aim is to cover eventual interpretations that could be given to the contracts drawn up in the operation to sign Neymar," a club statement read.Barca paid £48.6m for Santos striker Neymar, 22, in the summer with his parents receiving £34m of the fee.Between the initial fee paid in the summer, signing-on fee, wages during his five-year deal, agents fees and this latest tax payment, Neymar will have cost the club £106.8mLast month, Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropriated money.He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing.At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater.And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer.The club added: "The board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player."Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros [...] although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations."There has not yet been any confirmation whether the case will be dropped after Barcelona's payment.Neymar has scored seven goals in 18 league appearances for Barcelona this season, as well as netting three in seven Champions League matches. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Barcelona has received a "substantial" tax claim over the signing of Neymar, but the article states that the club denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the signing of the player. This is a contradiction, as the summary suggests that Barcelona has done something wrong, while the article states that the club is denying any wrongdoing.

2. The article states that Barcelona paid £48.6m for Neymar, but the summary suggests that the actual cost of the player was far greater if other contracts are taken into account. This is not supported by the article, which only mentions the £48.6m fee paid to Santos.

3. The article mentions that a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer, but the summary does not mention this. This is a significant omission, as it suggests that the summary is not providing a complete picture of the situation.

4. The article states that Barcelona has made a complimentary tax declaration of €13,550,830.56, but the summary does not mention this. This is another significant omission, as it suggests that the summary is not providing a complete picture of the situation.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains contradictions and omissions that suggest it is not providing a complete and accurate picture of the situation.
