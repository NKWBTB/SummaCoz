</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that James Haskell posted an Instagram photo dressed as Robert Downey Jr.'s character Iron Man.
2. The article does not mention anything about James Haskell posting an Instagram photo dressed as Iron Man. Instead, it mentions that he posted a photo of himself in an Iron Man costume on his Instagram page.
3. The summary incorrectly states that the movie premiered at Westfield London shopping centre on Tuesday evening. The article states that the movie premiered at the Westfield London shopping centre on Wednesday evening.
4. The summary incorrectly states that fans queued up to see the A-list cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson. The article does not mention anything about fans queuing up to see the cast.
5. The summary incorrectly states that James Haskell returned to Wasps for the 2012 season after spells with Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams, and Glasgow. The article states that he returned to Wasps for the 2012 season after spells with Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams, and Highlanders in New Zealand.
6. The summary incorrectly states that Haskell has played his rugby in France, Japan, and New Zealand after leaving Wasps in 2009. The article states that he has played his rugby in France, Japan, and New Zealand since returning to England in 2012.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several factual errors and omissions.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that James Haskell's Instagram photo dressed as Iron Man is the main focus of the article. However, the article primarily discusses James Haskell's rugby career and his return to Wasps in 2012, with a brief mention of his Instagram post at the beginning.
2. The article states that James Haskell posted the Iron Man photo on Instagram and briefly mentions the premiere of the Avengers: Age of Ultron movie but does not provide extensive details about the movie premiere or the A-list cast.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary focuses on the Instagram post and the movie premiere, while the article is primarily about James Haskell's rugby career and return to Wasps.
