    Summary: 
    barcelona have agreed a deal to sign neymar in connection with the club\'s tax evasion scandal. 

    Article: 
    However the Spanish champions insisted they had not committed any offence."The aim is to cover eventual interpretations that could be given to the contracts drawn up in the operation to sign Neymar," a club statement read.Barca paid £48.6m for Santos striker Neymar, 22, in the summer with his parents receiving £34m of the fee.Between the initial fee paid in the summer, signing-on fee, wages during his five-year deal, agents fees and this latest tax payment, Neymar will have cost the club £106.8mLast month, Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropriated money.He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing.At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater.And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer.The club added: "The board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player."Given the existence of a possible divergent interpretation of the exact amount of tax responsibility arising from the signing and to defend the club's reputation and good name, FC Barcelona has this morning made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros [...] although we remain convinced that the original tax payment was in line with our fiscal obligations."There has not yet been any confirmation whether the case will be dropped after Barcelona's payment.Neymar has scored seven goals in 18 league appearances for Barcelona this season, as well as netting three in seven Champions League matches. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Barcelona has agreed a deal to sign Neymar in connection with the club's tax evasion scandal. However, the article states that Barcelona denies any wrongdoing and insists that they had not committed any offense.

2. The summary mentions that Barcelona paid £48.6m for Neymar, but the article states that the actual cost of the player was far greater when other contracts are taken into account.

3. The summary mentions that a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer, but the article states that Barcelona denies any tax-related crime and has made a complimentary tax declaration of €13,550,830.56 to defend their reputation and good name.

4. Based on the above inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary makes claims about Barcelona's involvement in tax evasion and the actual cost of Neymar's transfer that are not supported by the article.

5. Therefore, the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content and should not be trusted. It is important to carefully review the article and not rely on summaries or headlines that may be misleading or inaccurate.
