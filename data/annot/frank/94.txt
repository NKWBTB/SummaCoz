    Article: 
    Fellow tenants Newport Gwent Dragons are subject to a takeover bid from the Welsh Rugby Union, who have said they see Rodney Parade "as a rugby venue."County have a lease to use the ground - and have primacy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League - until 2023."Our view is quite clear - we've got a contract," Foxall said."That is something that we're expecting to be honoured."Obviously there is a vote in early May by the shareholders for Newport Rugby and we'll wait and see what happens with that."The WRU's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday, 9 May.In 2013 the Exiles agreed a 10-year lease to use the stadium after gaining promotion to the Football League from the Conference.Newport RFC chairman Will Godfrey said both County and Newport Squash Club, who are also based at Rodney Parade, are protected under their current agreements.Godfrey said the WRU had been made aware of that fact. The WRU have signalled their intention to install an artificial surface which is against Football League rules.On the pitch, County are two points clear of the League Two relegation with two games remaining after six wins in 10 games under caretaker manager Mike Flynn and can clinch survival this weekend if they win and rivals Hartlepool lose.Newport secured promotion back to the Football League in 2013 and Foxall said relegation to the National League would be a "massive" blow,"To lose that status again, in a relatively short space of time would be pretty devastating for the fans but also for the city of Newport," Foxall told BBC Wales Today. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's the step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the main point of the summary
The main point of the summary is that Newport Gwent Dragons will not be given a contract before the end of the season, according to the rugby football league (foxall).

Step 2: Identify the main point of the article
The main point of the article is that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has made a takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, and the future of the club is uncertain.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistency
The inconsistency between the summary and the article is that the summary states that Newport Gwent Dragons will not be given a contract before the end of the season, while the article does not mention anything about a contract. Instead, the article focuses on the WRU's takeover bid and the potential installation of an artificial surface, which is against Football League rules.

Step 4: Analyze the reason for the inconsistency
The reason for the inconsistency is that the summary is based on a quote from Foxall, but the article does not provide any information about a contract for Newport Gwent Dragons. Instead, the article focuses on the WRU's takeover bid and the potential installation of an artificial surface. It appears that the summary may have misinterpreted or misquoted Foxall's statement.

Step 5: Evaluate the reliability of the source
The reliability of the source (the article) is high, as it is a news article from a reputable news organization (BBC News). However, the summary may be less reliable, as it appears to be based on a misinterpretation or misquote of Foxall's statement.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misinterprets or misquotes Foxall's statement. The article focuses on the WRU's takeover bid and the potential installation of an artificial surface, but the summary does not accurately reflect this information.
