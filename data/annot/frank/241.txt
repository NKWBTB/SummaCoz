</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that inmates at a prison in Essex have been left "notorious" due to a "breakdown".
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a "breakdown" or inmates being "notorious". Instead, it talks about packages being thrown over the prison wall and the efforts of the prison staff to stop contraband from entering the prison.
3. The word "breakdown" is not present in the article, and there is no information to suggest that the inmates are "notorious" due to any particular reason.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not present in the article and implies a different meaning than what is actually stated in the article.
