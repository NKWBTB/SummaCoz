    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man accused of murdering Vincent Barker said he was "preventable" and "preventable". However, the article does not mention anything about the man saying these words.
2. The article focuses on the alleged gross negligence manslaughter of Vincent Barker by eye specialist Honey Rose. The article states that the prosecution alleges that Ms. Rose's failure to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during a routine test and refer him for further investigation was "criminal" and that Vinnie's death was "preventable".
3. The summary does not mention anything about the alleged failure of Ms. Rose to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs or the risk of death involved. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The article focuses on the alleged negligence of Ms. Rose, while the summary mentions a man accused of murder. This is not consistent with the article, which does not mention anything about a man accused of murder.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. It appears to be a summary of a different story or a summary that has been incorrectly written.
