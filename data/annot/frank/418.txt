    Manchester City have apologised to supporters and promised to hand out ticket refunds after coaches they laid on for free were delayed and missed the kick-off at Crystal Palace. The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train. Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn’t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester.

'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of £12,000. Things did not get much better for the City fans when they finally arrived for the match as Manuel Pellegrini's side went down 2-1 to all-but-end their hopes of retaining their title. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Manchester City apologized to supporters and promised ticket refunds after the coaches they provided were delayed and missed the kick-off. However, the article states that the coaches were not delayed, but rather left the Etihad Stadium too late, which caused the supporters to miss the kick-off.
2. The summary mentions that the coaches were provided for free, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article states that the supporters had to pay for their match tickets.
3. The summary states that the club apologized to supporters and promised ticket refunds, but the article does not mention any apology or refunds. Instead, the club is only refunding the cost of the match tickets to the 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport.
4. The summary mentions that the coaches set off too late and that some complained that Mike Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides a more accurate account of the events, which is that the coaches left the Etihad Stadium too late, causing the supporters to miss the kick-off, and the club is refunding the cost of the match tickets to the affected fans.
