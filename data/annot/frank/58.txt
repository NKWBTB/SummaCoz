I would rather go in with the SDLP."Mr Nesbitt went on to say that, on Monday, he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with "very little criticism and a lot of support for what I was talking about"."I am confident in my position and I'm very confident and relaxed that [candidates] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer," he said."But people will come back on 2 March to thinking about the £85,000 a day that is going up in smoke, the 10 years of the DUP and Sin Féin in that castle and the impossibility, no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper, of leopards changing their spots."The manifesto, entitled 'Real Partnership', includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers to 7,500, prioritising the York Street interchange, standing up for the LGBT community and "guaranteeing" that no group is worse off because of Brexit.In a section entitled 'Cleaning Up Stormont', the party calls for:On the theme of the election being a referendum, he said it was about "incompetence, arrogance, cronyism and the strong whiff of corruption".He must hope that message will resonate more strongly than the continuing controversy over his remarks about transferring to the SDLP.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

The given summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The summary mentions "Danny Nesbitt's resignation" which is not present in the article. The article only mentions "Mike Nesbitt" as the leader of the Ulster Unionist party.
2. The summary states that the Ulster Unionist leader is "very confident" which is not mentioned in the article. The article only quotes Mike Nesbitt as saying "I am confident in my position" but does not use the word "very" to emphasize his confidence.

Therefore, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article and contains errors.
