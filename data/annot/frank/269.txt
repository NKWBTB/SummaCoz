There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: "Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes."It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity."The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: "The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde."Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site."Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles)."The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism."

<Summary>
the uk\'s oil and gas authority (nda) has confirmed it is investigating the discovery of a massive earthquake in the uk.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the UK's oil and gas authority (NDA) is investigating the discovery of a massive earthquake in the UK.
2. However, the article does not mention the NDA or any investigation.
3. The article only mentions Cuadrilla, the firm behind the fracking operations, suspending drilling as a precaution after a 1.5 magnitude tremor.
4. The article also mentions the British Geological Survey (BGS) monitoring fracking and reporting two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in March.
5. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions the NDA investigating an earthquake, while the article does not mention any investigation or the NDA.
6. The article focuses on Cuadrilla's decision to suspend drilling and the BGS's monitoring of fracking, but the summary does not accurately reflect this information.
7. Therefore, the summary is not a consistent summary of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary suggests that the UK's oil and gas authority (NDA) is investigating the discovery of a massive earthquake in the UK.
2. However, the article in question discusses a 1.5 magnitude tremor in Lancashire that led to the suspension of shale gas drilling. There is no mention of a "massive earthquake" in the article, and the magnitude described in the summary is significantly different from what is reported in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly characterizes the seismic event as a "massive earthquake" in the UK, while the article describes a much smaller tremor.
