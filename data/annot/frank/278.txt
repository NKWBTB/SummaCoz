    Share this withEmailFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkLandlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO).But many are put off - because a licence can cost Â£1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to Â£20,000, Southampton City Council said.The authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area.Shelter helpline adviser Nadeem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants."Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated. We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said.Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015).A council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence."The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Southampton City Council has been told to pay hundreds of millions of pounds a day for applying for a license.

However, the article does not mention anything about the council being told to pay hundreds of millions of pounds a day. Instead, it mentions that landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a license, and that some landlords have resisted applying for their license.

2. The summary implies that the lack of funding is the reason for the council's inability to apply for the license.

However, the article does not mention anything about a lack of funding as a reason for the council's inability to apply for the license. Instead, it mentions that the council has so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals for not applying for their license.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies a reason for the council's inability to apply for the license that is not supported by the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies a reason for the council's inability to apply for the license that is not supported by the article.
