I've got a week off then back to my studies to complete my final year.Media playback is not supported on this device"I love running for Scotland whenever I can and the Commonwealths are one of the few opportunities you can do it so, yeah, I'm gutted I'm going to be missing it."But you have to think about getting my degree and that was really important to me. I'm sure the team's going to do so, so well. They're going to do great."I think I've got at least two, even three more Olympics in me. What events? I don't know. Certainly, so much scope for the future."However, Muir says the World Indoor Championships in March are "potentially a target"."These next few months are going to be very full on with my studies," she explained."I feel like I'm in reasonable shape. I'd like to run in Birmingham."Hellen Obiri upset defending world champion Almaz Ayana to win 5,000m gold in London, with Sifan Hassan third.Muir's time of 14 minutes 52.07 seconds was her new outdoor personal best."I'm really happy," she said after Sunday's race."It was really tough competition out there. I'm delighted with that.

     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Laura Muir is missing the Commonwealth Games because she is missing the Commonwealth Games. However, the article states that Muir will not be attending the Commonwealth Games because she has to focus on her veterinary medicine studies.
2. The summary implies that Muir is missing the Commonwealth Games because she is busy with her studies, but the article states that Muir has already completed her exams and is returning to university next week.
3. The summary states that Muir is gutted about missing the Commonwealth Games, but the article quotes Muir as saying that she is "delighted" with her performance in the World Athletics Championships and that she has "a lot of potential for the future."

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents Muir's reasons for missing the Commonwealth Games and her attitude towards the event.
