<Summary>
scotland\'s laura muir is to miss the commonwealth games in london next month because she is missing the commonwealth games.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Laura Muir is missing the Commonwealth Games because she is missing the Commonwealth Games. This is a circular statement that doesn't make sense.
2. The article states that Muir will not be able to participate in the Commonwealth Games because she has to focus on her studies and final year of veterinary medicine.
3. The article also mentions that Muir has been competing in various races, including the World Athletics Championships, and has achieved a new outdoor personal best in the 5,000m.
4. Therefore, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the reasons why Muir will be missing the Commonwealth Games.
5. The summary is incorrect because it implies that Muir is missing the Commonwealth Games for no reason, when in fact she has a valid reason for not participating due to her studies.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Scotland's Laura Muir is going to miss the Commonwealth Games in London next month.
2. However, the article does not state that Laura Muir will miss the Commonwealth Games in London. Instead, the article mentions that she won't be with the Scotland team at next year's Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast. There is no mention of her missing the Commonwealth Games in London in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which mentions Laura Muir missing the Commonwealth Games in London, while the article does not provide such information.
