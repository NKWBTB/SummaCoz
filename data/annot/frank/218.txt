    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the conservatives have retained control of the green party, but the article does not mention the conservatives or the green party at all.
2. The article only mentions the campaign expenditure of four political parties: UKIP, the Tories, the Lib Dems, and Labour.
3. The summary is incorrect because the conservatives are not mentioned in the article, and the green party is not mentioned as having retained control of anything.
4. The article only discusses the campaign expenditure of the four parties mentioned, and does not mention the green party at all.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it references the conservatives and the green party, when the article does not mention those parties.
