Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that UKIP won the May election, while the summary states that the Conservatives retained control of the Green Party. This is inconsistent, as UKIP won the election, not the Conservatives.
2. The article provides information on the campaign spending of various political parties, including the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, and the Green Party. However, the summary does not mention anything about campaign spending or the results of the election.
3. The article states that the six highest-spending parties spent a total of £9,347,087 on campaigning, but the summary does not provide any information about the amount spent by the Green Party.
4. The article mentions that the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems all spent more than they did during the 2009 European election campaign, but the summary does not provide any information about the 2009 election.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the results of the election or the campaign spending of the political parties. Instead, it seems to be focused on a different topic, such as the retention of control of the Green Party by the Conservatives.
