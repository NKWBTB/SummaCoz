     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that Torquay United have signed Myles Keating and Ruairi Keating on loan until January, but the article does not mention anything about a loan deal. Instead, it states that Myles Keating has joined the club permanently, while Ruairi Keating has joined on a free transfer.
2. The summary mentions that both players have joined Torquay United from Barrow, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that Myles Keating was recommended to Torquay United by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams, and that Ruairi Keating is young and raw but hungry to show what he's about.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the players' previous clubs, but the article states that Myles Keating has previously played for Sligo Rovers, Galway United, and Finn Harps, while Ruairi Keating is young and raw but hungry to show what he's about.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
