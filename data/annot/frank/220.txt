<Summary>
torquay united have signed barrow\'s myles keating and barrow\'s ruairi keating on loan until january.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Torquay United have signed Barrow's Myles Keating and Barrow's Ruairi Keating on loan until January.
2. However, the article states that Myles Keating has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals, which means he will not be on loan to Torquay United.
3. Additionally, the article does not mention Ruairi Keating being signed on loan to Torquay United.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions two players (Myles and Ruairi) who are not mentioned in the article, and it also incorrectly states that Myles is joining Torquay United on loan.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Torquay United has signed Barrow's Myles Keating and Barrow's Ruairi Keating on loan until January.
2. However, the article mentions that Centre-back Anderson has canceled his Barrow contract to join National League rivals. It does not explicitly mention that Torquay United has signed Myles Keating and Ruairi Keating on loan until January. The article focuses on Anderson's move and does not provide details about the mentioned loan signings.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies that Torquay United has signed the two players on loan until January, which is not supported by the information in the article.
