</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Chris Copeland and his wife were stabbed following an argument outside a New York City club early on Wednesday.
2. The article states that the couple was stabbed by a man who interrupted them as they argued outside 1OAK in Chelsea.
3. The summary does not mention the name of the club where the incident took place, while the article specifically mentions 1OAK.
4. The summary states that the suspect, Shezoy Bleary, pulled out a knife and stabbed Copeland in the abdomen and elbow, and then turned on Saltare and stabbed her in the breast, buttocks, and arm.
5. The article adds that another woman, Catherine Somani, 23, was also stabbed in the abdomen as she tried to break up the fight.
6. The summary does not mention the arrest of any individuals, while the article states that two Atlanta Hawks players, Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha, were arrested for failing to clear the scene for police.
7. The summary does not mention the injuries sustained by the victims, while the article states that Copeland and his wife were listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, and that Somani was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital.
8. The summary does not mention the motive for the attack, while the article speculates that it may have been a random attack.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it leaves out several key details, such as the name of the club, the arrest of the two players, and the motive for the attack. Additionally, the summary does not provide as much context as the article, which includes information about the victims, the suspect, and the location of the incident.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Chris Copeland, a player for the Indiana Pacers, and his wife, Katrine Saltare, were both stabbed following an argument outside a New York City club early on Wednesday. It mentions the involvement of a 22-year-old man, Shezoy Bleary, in the incident.
2. However, the summary cuts off before providing complete information and does not include some essential details that are present in the article, such as the involvement of two other NBA players, Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha of the Atlanta Hawks, in obstructing the crime scene when police arrived. It also mentions another woman, Catherine Somani, being stabbed while trying to break up the fight.
3. The inconsistency is due to the incomplete information provided in the summary, which leaves out important details present in the article, including the involvement of other individuals in the incident.
