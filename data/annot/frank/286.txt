    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a new theatre is to be built in the grounds of Alexandra Palace, but the article does not mention any plans to build a new theatre. Instead, the article focuses on the restoration and refurbishment of the existing theatre and studios.
2. The summary mentions that the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music, but the article only mentions theatrical performances and cinema screenings.
3. The summary states that the BBC studios will be repaired and refurbished, but the article does not mention anything about the BBC or the BBC studios.
4. The summary mentions that the theatre will reopen in 2018 if funds are raised, but the article does not mention any specific reopening date.
5. The summary mentions that the project includes the refurbishment of the glazed east court, but the article does not mention this detail.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not mentioned in the article, and leaves out important information that is included in the article.
