</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a new theatre is to be built in the grounds of Alexandra Palace, but the article does not mention any plans to build a new theatre. Instead, it talks about restoring and refurbishing the existing theatre.
2. The summary mentions a £1 million project, but the article does not provide any information about the cost of the project.
3. The summary states that the theatre is in Kent, but the article does not mention anything about the location of the theatre.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the theatre's location, the cost of the project, and the fact that a new theatre is not being built.
