The 10-year-old Irish-bred horse collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.He was treated by veterinary staff before being pronounced dead.The British Horseracing Authority confirmed the horse suffered from a "severe pulmonary haemorrhage".Tony Welsh, acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, said: "Episodes such as this are rare, and can occur in horses which have no underlying health issues, and amongst all disciplines of sport horses."In spite of the rarity of these incidents, as a sport we are determined to do more to understand what causes these symptoms, and whether more can be done to prevent it."In Saturday's race, King George winner Thistlecrack caught Many Clouds close to the finish but the Trevor Hemmings-owned gelding, ridden by Leighton Aspell, fought back to win.Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, which had seen him over-heat and "wobble" on his feet, but the horse had never collapsed before, and had shown no symptoms of post-race ataxia on Saturday.Many Clouds had previously won the Gold Cup trial in 2015 and the Hennessy Gold Cup in 2014.Trainer Oliver Sherwood described him as the "horse of a lifetime".BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius LysaghtThe crucial words here are "no significant underlying health issues".On more than one occasion, notably after his Grand National success, Many Clouds received treatment for a tendency to 'overheat', but he soon recovered, and his welfare was closely monitored by the authorities as a result.With that fact in mind, questions have been raised as to whether that condition was linked to his death, but this report concludes he was the victim of a haemorrhage rarely seen on the racetrack.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a horse died after falling from a balcony at Cheltenham's festival.
2. The article does not mention anything about a horse falling from a balcony.
3. The article reports that the horse, Many Clouds, collapsed and died after winning a race at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.
4. The cause of death, according to the article, was a severe pulmonary haemorrhage.
5. The summary does not mention the cause of death or any details about the race.
6. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately report the events described in the article.

The reason for the inconsistency is that the summary is not based on the information provided in the article. The summary is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the events described in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a horse has died after falling from a balcony at Cheltenham's festival, and this revelation is linked to the death of an 11-year-old boy.
2. However, the article reports that the 10-year-old horse named Many Clouds collapsed and died after winning the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. There is no mention of the horse falling from a balcony, and the cause of the horse's death is attributed to a "severe pulmonary haemorrhage." The death of the 11-year-old boy is not mentioned in the article in connection with the horse's death.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that the horse's death resulted from falling from a balcony at Cheltenham's festival, which is not supported by the article.
