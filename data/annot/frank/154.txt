    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions a new augmented reality experience being launched in the Isle of Lewis, but the article does not mention anything about a new augmented reality experience. Instead, the article talks about an app that will provide online information about the Hebridean Celtic Festival.
2. The summary states that the new augmented reality experience is part of a new augmented reality headset, but the article does not mention anything about a headset.
3. The summary mentions that the experience will be available to people around the world, but the article only talks about people attending the festival in person.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is describing a different product or feature than what is described in the article.
