    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Rickie Fowler called out an online hater who accused his girlfriend Alexis Randock of being a "gold digger." However, the article states that the hater, "fatalsplash," accused Alexis of not having to work for her living and being a "gold digger."
2. The summary mentions that the hater accused Alexis of being a "gold digger" because she posted a photo on her Instagram account, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the hater accused Alexis of not having to work for her living.
3. The summary states that Rickie Fowler responded to the hater by telling him to "get your facts straight," but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Rickie Fowler told the hater to "get your facts straight before you talk to my girlfriend like that."
4. The summary states that Alexis also stood up for herself by posting that she works her "butt off to be able to fully support myself in NYC," but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Alexis informed the hater that she worked her "butt off."

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. For example, the summary states that the hater accused Alexis of being a "gold digger" because she posted a photo on her Instagram account, but the article does not mention this. Additionally, the summary states that Rickie Fowler told the hater to "get your facts straight," but the article does not mention this.
