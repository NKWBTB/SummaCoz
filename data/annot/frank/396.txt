</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the abusive commenter accused Alexis of being a "gold digger." However, the article states that the commenter accused her of not having to work for what she has, implying that she is living off of Rickie Fowler's wealth.
2. The summary omits the fact that Rickie Fowler responded to the commenter and defended his girlfriend. The article states that he called out the troll and told them to "get their facts straight."
3. The summary also omits the fact that Alexis stood up for herself and informed the commenter that she works hard to support herself. The article states that she posted a response to the commenter, saying that she works her "butt off" to live a nice life.
4. The summary does not accurately convey the tone of the article, which is more negative towards the troll and more supportive of Rickie Fowler and Alexis. The summary makes it seem like a generic celebrity gossip story, while the article has a more serious tone and focuses on the issue of online bullying.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details, distorts the tone of the article, and does not accurately convey the information presented.
