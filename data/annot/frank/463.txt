(CNN)They may not be "Star Trek"-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. "I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years," NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. "We know where to look. We know how to look," she said. "In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road." NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. "Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice," the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. "We are not talking about little green men," Stofan said at the panel. "We are talking about little microbes." Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. "I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star," he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? "Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low," he said. "And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that NASA scientist Ellen Stofan said that they will have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade.
2. However, the article states that Stofan said they will have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years, not within a decade.
3. The summary also states that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, but the article does not mention anything about water.
4. The summary mentions the Hubble Space Telescope, but the article does not mention it.
5. The summary implies that NASA is looking for intelligent alien civilizations, but the article clarifies that NASA is only looking for microorganisms.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides a more accurate and nuanced view of NASA's search for evidence of life beyond Earth.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that NASA scientist Ellen Stofan said, "we know how to look."
2. However, the article states that Ellen Stofan said, "I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade."
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary attributes the statement "we know how to look" directly to Ellen Stofan, while in the article, this statement is not explicitly made by her but rather a general assertion about humanity's capability.
