    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary states that Frankie Franz watched the Spanish right-back pull off the trick shot in a video recorded at Barcelona's Ciutat Esportiva training ground, but the article does not mention anything about a video or a training ground.

Step 2: Analyze the article

The article states that Frankie Franz, a nine-year-old schoolboy, scored an audacious 27-yard goal into a basketball hoop twice. The article also mentions that Frankie watched Barcelona star Martin Montoya pull off the trick shot and decided to try it himself.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies with the article

The summary states that Frankie watched the Spanish right-back pull off the trick shot in a video recorded at Barcelona's Ciutat Esportiva training ground, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary states that Frankie scored the goal into the basketball hoop once, while the article states that he scored twice.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistencies

The inconsistencies in the summary are likely due to the fact that the article and the summary are based on different sources or information. The summary may have been based on a different video or source that showed Frankie watching a video of Martin Montoya pulling off the trick shot, while the article is based on a different source that mentions Frankie scoring the goal into the basketball hoop twice.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not mentioned in the article, such as a video recorded at Barcelona's Ciutat Esportiva training ground, and it omits information that is mentioned in the article, such as Frankie scoring the goal into the basketball hoop twice.
