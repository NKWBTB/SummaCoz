    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Sean Long scored an injury-time equalizer for Blackpool, but the article does not mention any goal scored by Sean Long.
2. The summary mentions that Blackpool equalized from a corner, but the article does not mention any corner kicks for Blackpool.
3. The summary states that Colchester finished the game with 10 men, but the article does not mention any red cards or substitutions for Colchester.

Based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. It appears to be a summary of a different match or a fictional game, rather than the actual match between Blackpool and Colchester United.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Sean Long's injury-time equalizer earned Blackpool a draw at Colchester. 
2. However, the article does not mention Sean Long scoring an injury-time equalizer. Instead, it describes the events of the match, including the goals scored by other players and the final result being a draw (1-1).
3. Therefore, the inconsistency is due to the error in the summary that implies Sean Long's specific goal, which the article does not support.
