    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was shot dead in his home in Sheffield, while the article states that the man was shot outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, close to the city centre. The two locations do not match.
2. The summary states that the man was either in or close to a black Mercedes car when he was shot, while the article does not mention anything about a car.
3. The summary states that the victim was taken to Northern General hospital, while the article states that the victim was taken to the scene of the shooting.
4. The summary does not mention anything about armed police sealing off the area, while the article states that armed police were called to the scene.
5. The summary does not mention anything about previous shootings in the area, while the article mentions several recent shootings in Sheffield, including one on Monday and another earlier this month.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
