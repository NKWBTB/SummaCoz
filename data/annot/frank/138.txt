Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The article states that the victim was shot outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, while the summary says he was shot in his home.
2. The article specifies that the victim was taken to Northern General hospital and died from his injuries, while the summary does not mention the victim's fate.
3. The article mentions that there have been several recent shootings in Sheffield, but the summary does not provide any context or information about the broader situation.

Overall, the summary is too brief and lacks important details, making it inconsistent with the article.
