</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Torquay United have signed defender Scott Anderson from a National League side for an undisclosed fee.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Scott Anderson being signed by Torquay United. Instead, it mentions a player named Anderson who has cancelled his contract with Barrow and is set to join a National League rival.
3. The name "Scott Anderson" does not appear in the article at all.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a player named Scott Anderson being signed by Torquay United.

Overall, it seems that the summary is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the information in the article.
