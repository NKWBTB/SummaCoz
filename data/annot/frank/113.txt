    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Blackpool missed the chance to go top of League Two, but the article does not mention anything about Blackpool having the opportunity to go top.
2. The summary says that the game ended in a draw, but the article states that Colchester United equalized in the second half and the game ended 1-1.
3. The summary mentions that Blackpool had a chance to clinch the win 15 minutes from time, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that Colchester finished the game with 10 men, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
