    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Billericay Town have sacked manager Jose Wright, but the article does not mention anything about Wright being sacked. Instead, it discusses the possibility of Wright buying 20% of the club and becoming a club director.
2. The summary also mentions that Wright has died at the age of 88, but the article does not mention anything about Wright's death.
3. The article does mention that Wright played non-league football for several clubs and that he was runner-up in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2011, but the summary does not include these details.
4. The article also mentions that the club has been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin and that they have signed former England international Paul Konchesky, but the summary does not include these details either.

Therefore, based on the differences between the summary and the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, such as Wright's death and sacking, and omits other important details that are present in the article, such as the club's takeover and the signing of Paul Konchesky.
