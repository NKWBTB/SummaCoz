The family of murdered Australian baseball player Chris Lane broke down in court as they listened to an emergency call revealing the distressing final moments of his life. The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past.

Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Smith's 911 phone call was played in court Chancey Luna has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly shooting Mr Lane in the back Luna, a Duncan high school student, showed no emotion during the 911 recording and Ms Prior's evidence. Another local, Richard Rhoades, who also tried to help Lane, said he took off his shirt to place it over Lane's face when they realised he was dead. 'I just thought it would be nice to close his eyes,' he said. Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'. The lawyer told the jury that for Luna to be found guilty of first degree murder, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the murder was premeditated. Prosecutors said Luna internationally pulled the trigger. The trial continues.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary states that Chris Lane was shot in the back with a.22 calibre handgun, which is correct. However, the article provides additional information that the shot was fired from a Ford Focus, and that two teenage friends were in the car with the shooter, Chancey Luna.
2. The summary does not mention the 911 call or the witnesses who tried to save Chris Lane's life. The article, on the other hand, includes a detailed account of the 911 call and the efforts of the witnesses to resuscitate Lane.
3. The summary mentions that Chris Lane was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, which is correct. However, the article provides additional information about Lane's visit to his girlfriend in Duncan and how he was randomly gunned down.
4. The summary does not mention the name of Lane's girlfriend, Sarah Harper, or any details about her. The article, on the other hand, includes her name and her presence in court during the trial.
5. The summary does not mention the defense lawyer's statement that Chancey Luna was "reckless" and was only trying to "scare the jogger." The article, on the other hand, includes this information.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include many of the details provided in the article, such as the 911 call, the witnesses' efforts to save Lane's life, Lane's visit to his girlfriend, and the defense lawyer's statement.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Chris Lane was shot and killed with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane, listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 call made by witnesses who tried to save Chris Lane's life. Mr. Lane was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University. He was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was shot, and there are photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue.
2. However, the article provides information about Chris Lane being shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun, and his parents listening to the 911 call made by witnesses. It mentions that Mr. Lane was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University and that he was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was shot. The article does not specifically mention photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary introduces additional details about photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue, which is not supported by the article.
