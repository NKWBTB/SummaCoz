    Summary: 
    an optometrist who failed to spot an eye condition in a boy who later died has been cleared of manslaughter. 

    Article: 
    Vincent Barker, known as Vinnie, died in July 2012, five months after he had a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich.The prosecution told Ipswich Crown Court the conduct of eye specialist Honey Rose, 35, was so far below the expected standard it was "criminal".Ms Rose denies a charge of gross negligence manslaughter.Read more on this story and other news from SuffolkJonathan Rees QC said the alleged failure of Ms Rose, of Newham, east London, to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test, and refer him on for further investigation, was "at the heart of the prosecution case".A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death, the court heard."The prosecution allege that Vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant, Ms Rose, done her job properly," he told the jury."Given the risk of death involved, her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent optometrist - that it was criminal."The trial continues. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the optometrist was "cleared of manslaughter," implying that the optometrist was acquitted of any wrongdoing.
2. However, the article states that the prosecution alleges that the optometrist's conduct was "so far below the expected standard it was 'criminal'" and that the death was "preventable."
3. This implies that the optometrist did not meet the expected standards of care, and that the death was at least partially caused by the optometrist's negligence.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as the summary implies that the optometrist was acquitted of any wrongdoing, while the article suggests that the optometrist was negligent and that the death was preventable.
