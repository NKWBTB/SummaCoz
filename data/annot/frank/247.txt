     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the defendant, Brian Wright, is accused of causing the pensioner's death by careless driving, but the article does not mention any death. Instead, it states that the victim, Sylvia Blackburn, suffered serious head injuries.
2. The summary states that the defendant is accused of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, but the article does not use the word "dangerous" to describe the defendant's driving. Instead, it states that the defendant failed to stop for a red light and hit the victim.
3. The summary states that the defendant is being tried for causing serious injury by dangerous driving, but the article does not mention any charge or trial. Instead, it states that the case has been paused for five minutes so that the defendant could compose himself.
4. The summary states that the defendant is accused of turning the victim's "world upside down," but the article does not mention any such statement from the defendant.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the severity of the defendant's actions and adds details that are not present in the article.
