    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Crawley Town signed right-back Glenn Groves from non-league side Leway Town.

However, the article does not mention anything about Crawley Town signing a player named Glenn Groves. Instead, it mentions a player named Dan Groves, who is set to become a club director.

2. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different player (Glenn Groves) than the one mentioned in the article (Dan Groves).

3. The article does mention that Dan Groves will become a club director, but it does not mention anything about Crawley Town signing a player named Glenn Groves.

4. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the information in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different player and does not accurately reflect the information in the article.
