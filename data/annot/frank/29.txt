</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that an investigation has been launched into the cause of a fire at a recycling site in Greater Manchester.
2. However, the article does not mention any investigation into the cause of the fire. Instead, it reports that the Environment Agency (EA) has revoked the environmental permit of the site operator, Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, due to concerns about the impact of a fire on nearby residents, transport, and the environment.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of an investigation into the cause of the fire in the article.
4. The article does mention that the EA has taken enforcement action against the site operators, but this is not the same as an investigation into the cause of the fire.
5. The article also mentions that the cause of the fire remains undetermined, which suggests that there is no known cause for the fire and therefore no investigation has been launched.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of an investigation into the cause of the fire in the article. Instead, the article focuses on the EA's decision to revoke the environmental permit of the site operators due to concerns about the impact of a fire on nearby residents, transport, and the environment.
