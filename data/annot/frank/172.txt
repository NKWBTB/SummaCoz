</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man was convicted of attempting to blackmail a woman and engaging in sexual activity with her boyfriend.
2. However, the article states that the man, Clive Weatherhogg, was convicted of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity with him and with her boyfriend, and of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.
3. The summary does not mention the coercion or the intentional causing of the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images, which are key elements of the article's account of Weatherhogg's crimes.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately convey the full range of Weatherhogg's crimes as described in the article.
5. The article also mentions that Weatherhogg was placed on the sex offenders register, which is not mentioned in the summary.
6. Finally, the summary states that Weatherhogg was jailed for eight years, but the article does not mention the length of his sentence.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the full range of Weatherhogg's crimes and omits important details such as his placement on the sex offenders register and the length of his sentence.
