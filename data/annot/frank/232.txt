    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The summary does not mention the film's title, Beauty and the Beast, which is a crucial piece of information that should be included in a summary of the article.

2. The summary mentions "Oscar-winning oscar winner" twice, which is redundant and not present in the original article.

3. The summary mentions "actress" twice, but the article only mentions one actress, Emma Watson, who will play the role of Belle.

4. The summary mentions "Kevin Kline" and "Luke Evans" as if they are part of the cast, but the article only mentions Kevin Kline as having signed on to play Maurice, and does not mention Luke Evans at all.

5. The summary mentions "Josh Gad" as Gaston's sidekick, but the article does not mention Josh Gad or his character, LeFou.

6. The summary mentions the film's release date as 17 March 2017, but the article does not mention the release date.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes unnecessary information, leaves out important details, and mentions characters and plot points that are not present in the article.
