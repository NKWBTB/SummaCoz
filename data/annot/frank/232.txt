Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary mentions "Oscar-winning actress" multiple times, indicating that the article is about an actress who has won an Oscar.
2. However, the article does not mention any actress winning an Oscar. Instead, it mentions Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad being cast in the movie.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of any Oscar-winning actress in the article.
4. The repetition of "Oscar-winning actress" in the summary is likely a mistake or a misinterpretation of the article's content.
5. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article, without the mention of an Oscar-winning actress.
