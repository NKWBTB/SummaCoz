</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary mentions "Oscar-winning actress" multiple times, indicating that the article is about an actress who has won an Oscar.
2. However, the article does not mention any actress winning an Oscar. Instead, it mentions Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad being cast in the movie.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of any Oscar-winning actress in the article.
4. The repetition of "Oscar-winning actress" in the summary is likely a mistake or a misinterpretation of the article's content.
5. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article, without the mention of an Oscar-winning actress.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states a repetition of the phrases "oscar-winning" and "oscar winner" followed by "actress."
2. However, the article provides information about the casting for Disney's live-action adaptation of "Beauty and the Beast," including the roles various actors are playing. It mentions Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad in their respective roles. There is no repetition of the phrase "oscar-winning" or "oscar winner" in the article, and it doesn't specify which actress is being referred to with these terms.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary repeatedly mentioning "oscar-winning" and "oscar winner" without connecting these phrases to any specific actress or actor, while the article provides clear information about the cast of the movie.
