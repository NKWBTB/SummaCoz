    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Dame Sarah Storey won a gold medal at the World Para-Athletics Championships in London. However, the article states that the championships were held in Nottwil, Switzerland, not London.
2. The summary does not mention that Storey won four golds at the 2012 Games in London, as stated in the article.
3. The summary states that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that Storey has won 17 titles, but the article states that she has won 22 medals, including 11 gold, eight silver, and three bronze medals.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important information.
