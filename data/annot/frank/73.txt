</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the event was held in Nottwil, Switzerland, but the summary claims that the event was held in London. This is not consistent, as London is not a location in Switzerland.
2. The article mentions that Dame Sarah Storey won the gold medal in the road race, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it claims that she won a gold medal at the World Para-Athletics Championships, which is not accurate.
3. The article states that Storey is Britain's most decorated female Paralympian with 22 medals, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it simply states that she is the first British woman to win a gold medal at the World Para-Athletics Championships, which is not true.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the location of the event, the specific event that Storey won, and Storey's overall medal count.
