Fellow tenants Newport Gwent Dragons are subject to a takeover bid from the Welsh Rugby Union, who have said they see Rodney Parade "as a rugby venue."County have a lease to use the ground - and have primacy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League - until 2023."Our view is quite clear - we've got a contract," Foxall said."That is something that we're expecting to be honoured."Obviously there is a vote in early May by the shareholders for Newport Rugby and we'll wait and see what happens with that."The WRU's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday, 9 May.In 2013 the Exiles agreed a 10-year lease to use the stadium after gaining promotion to the Football League from the Conference.Newport RFC chairman Will Godfrey said both County and Newport Squash Club, who are also based at Rodney Parade, are protected under their current agreements.Godfrey said the WRU had been made aware of that fact. The WRU have signalled their intention to install an artificial surface which is against Football League rules.On the pitch, County are two points clear of the League Two relegation with two games remaining after six wins in 10 games under caretaker manager Mike Flynn and can clinch survival this weekend if they win and rivals Hartlepool lose.Newport secured promotion back to the Football League in 2013 and Foxall said relegation to the National League would be a "massive" blow,"To lose that status again, in a relatively short space of time would be pretty devastating for the fans but also for the city of Newport," Foxall told BBC Wales Today.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "Newport Gwent Dragons have been given permission to take over Newport Gwent Dragons." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) giving permission for Newport Gwent Dragons to take over themselves.
2. The article states that the WRU has made a takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, and that the bid will be put to a vote on May 9th. This is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article regarding the lease agreement between Newport County and Rodney Parade. The article states that Newport County has a lease to use the ground until 2023, and that the WRU's takeover bid could potentially affect this lease agreement. The summary does not mention the lease agreement or the potential impact of the takeover bid on it.
4. The summary states that Newport Gwent Dragons have been given permission to take over Newport Gwent Dragons, which is not a accurate reflection of the article. The article does not mention any permission being given to Newport Gwent Dragons.
5. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article regarding the potential installation of an artificial surface at Rodney Parade. The article states that the WRU has signaled their intention to install an artificial surface, which is against Football League rules. The summary does not mention this.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article regarding the takeover bid, the lease agreement, and the potential installation of an artificial surface.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Newport Gwent Dragons have been given permission to take over Newport Gwent Dragons and Newport Gwent Dragons.
2. However, the article does not support this claim. The article mentions the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, but it does not indicate that permission has been granted or that Newport County (referred to as "Exiles" in the article) or Newport Squash Club are taking over Newport Gwent Dragons.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that Newport Gwent Dragons are taking over Newport Gwent Dragons and Newport Gwent Dragons, while the article discusses the takeover bid for the rugby team by the Welsh Rugby Union.
