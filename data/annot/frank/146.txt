Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today, but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three."It was so unlike Spurs, they do so well at home, but the contrast is amazing. There's a lack of pace, and a different mindset when they go away from home. They have to improve and quickly."
