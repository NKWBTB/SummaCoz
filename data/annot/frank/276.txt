We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said.Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015).A council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence."The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals.

<Summary>
thousands of unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes in southampton because of a shortage of landlords.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that there are 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the Southampton area, but the summary claims that there is a shortage of landlords. This is inconsistent, as a shortage of landlords would suggest that there are fewer landlords, not more.
2. The article states that landlords are being put off by the cost of the licence, which is £1,000. However, the summary suggests that the landlords are being forced to enter the market, which implies that they are being compelled to become landlords, rather than choosing to do so voluntarily.
3. The article mentions that the council has gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals, which suggests that there is enforcement action being taken against landlords who do not comply with the licensing regime. This is not mentioned in the summary.
4. The summary does not provide any evidence to support the claim of a shortage of landlords. In fact, the article states that landlords are being put off by the cost of the licence, which suggests that there may be a surplus of landlords, rather than a shortage.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and does not provide an accurate representation of the information provided.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that thousands of unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton due to a shortage of landlords.
2. However, the article does not support the idea that unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes. The article discusses the requirement for landlords to obtain licenses for Houses of Multiple Occupation (HMOs) and the challenges they face, such as the cost of licensing. It mentions concerns of tenants, but it doesn't state that landlords are being forced to live in their own properties.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which presents a situation not supported by the article's content.
