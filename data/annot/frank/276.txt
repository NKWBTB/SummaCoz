    Share this withEmailFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinCopy this linkLandlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO).But many are put off - because a licence can cost Â£1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to Â£20,000, Southampton City Council said.The authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area.Shelter helpline adviser Nadeem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants."Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated. We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said.Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015).A council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence."The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton due to a shortage of landlords. However, the article does not mention anything about landlords being forced to enter their homes. Instead, it talks about the requirement for landlords to apply for a license to operate an HMO.
2. The summary mentions that there is a shortage of landlords, but the article does not support this claim. The article only mentions the shortage of affordable homes and the fear of eviction and poorly maintained properties faced by HMO tenants.
3. The summary implies that the licensing requirement is the cause of the shortage of landlords, but the article does not support this claim. The article only mentions the licensing requirement as a way to regulate HMOs and improve living conditions for tenants.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that landlords who fail to apply for a license can face fines of up to £20,000, which is mentioned in the article. This omission suggests that the summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that misrepresent the content of the article.
