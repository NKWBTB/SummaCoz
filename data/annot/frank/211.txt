There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet."Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform."So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking."The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair".He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives."The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."

<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Scottish government has been accused of "unfairly unfair" by a watchdog, implying that the government has been accused of being unfair twice. However, the article does not mention any accusations of unfairness against the government.
2. The article states that the Commission on Local Tax Reform found that the current council tax system has built-in problems and that there is no "magic bullet" to cure these defects. However, the summary does not mention the commission's findings or the fact that the system has built-in problems.
3. The article explains that the commission was set up to examine fairer alternatives to the current council tax system, and that the commission will report back later this year. However, the summary does not mention the commission's purpose or the fact that it will report back later this year.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the content of the article. Specifically, it misrepresents the commission's findings, misstates the purpose of the commission, and implies that the government has been accused of unfairness without providing any evidence for this claim.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the Scottish government has been accused of being "unfairly unfair" by a watchdog after a report found that a council tax system was not stored.
2. However, the article does not mention any accusation of the Scottish government being "unfairly unfair." The article discusses a review of the council tax system and the challenges associated with it but does not contain any such accusation or use the phrase "unfairly unfair."
3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of the phrase "unfairly unfair" and the statement that the council tax system was not stored, neither of which is supported by the article's content.
