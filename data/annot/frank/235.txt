    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Simon Stevens is going to play the "beauty of the beauty and the beast." However, the article states that Emma Watson is playing the role of Belle, not Simon Stevens. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary also states that Kevin Kline is going to play Maurice, the father of the "Beauty" character Belle. This is correct, as the article confirms that Kevin Kline has signed on to play this role.
3. The summary mentions that Dan Stevens is going to play the Beast, which is also correct, as the article confirms that Dan Stevens has been cast in this role.
4. The summary states that Luke Evans is going to co-star as the villainous Gaston. This is correct, as the article confirms that Luke Evans has been cast in this role.
5. The summary mentions that Josh Gad is going to play Gaston's sidekick LeFou. This is not mentioned in the article, so the summary is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that Simon Stevens is going to play Belle, and it mentions Josh Gad's character (LeFou) who is not mentioned in the article.
