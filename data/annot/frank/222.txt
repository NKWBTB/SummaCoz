</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Torquay United signed striker Myles Anderson on a two-year contract after he was released by a National League club.
2. However, the article states that Anderson, a centre-back, cancelled his contract with Barrow by mutual consent to join a National League rival, but does not mention a two-year contract.
3. The summary also refers to the club as "Torquay United," which is not the name of the club mentioned in the article (the club is called "Barrow").
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains inaccurate information about the club and the player's contract.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains false information about the club and the player's contract.
