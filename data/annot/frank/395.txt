Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after video footage emerged appearing to show him fighting and aiming a headbutt at stewards after a defeat by Bayern Munich on Wednesday night. Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that UNK (Emir Spahic) was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the world cup.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention anything about the World Cup. The article only mentions the DFB-Pokal quarter-final match between Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich.

2. The summary states that UNK is expected to miss his side's trip to face Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention anything about UNK missing a match due to an injury. In fact, the article states that Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury, but it does not mention any information about him missing future matches.

3. The summary states that UNK was substituted in the 90th minute after 120 minutes.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention anything about the match going into extra time. The article only mentions that the match ended in a 5-3 defeat for Bayer Leverkusen on penalties after 120 goalless minutes.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and misleading information. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that an unidentified individual (referred to as "UNK") was substituted in the 90th minute after 120 minutes of play.
2. However, the article states that the individual in question is Emir Spahic, a Bayer Leverkusen defender. Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury after 120 goalless minutes of play in a DFB-Pokal match.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary provides vague and incomplete information about the individual involved and the context of their substitution in the match, omitting crucial details such as the player's name and the circumstances surrounding his substitution.
