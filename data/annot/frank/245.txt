Sylvia Blackburn, 72, suffered serious head injuries outside Bedford Road Lower School, Kempston, last December.Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, told Luton Crown Court he had been blinded by the setting sun.He accepted he had struck Mrs Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving.Mrs Blackburn is now being treated in residential care.Judge Michael Kay QC paused the case for five minutes so Mr Wright could compose himself after he told the court how he had turned his victim's "world upside down".Mr Wright said: "I understand Sylvia was a much-loved lollipop lady, who was loved by the children."I am truly sorry for what I have done to her and her family."Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop for a red light, the jury heard.The married mother-of-three, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils left school.When the traffic lights turned red, Mrs Blackburn, who was wearing appropriate clothing, stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road.Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said traffic in the other direction had stopped, but the defendant did not, and hit her.Mr Wright, of The Dell, said he could not remember if the traffic lights were red or green."I was totally blinded by the sun," he said. "I just heard a bump. I was in total shock."Since that day I have thought of nothing else other than Sylvia Blackburn and her family and the position I have put them in."The court heard the sun was 10 minutes from setting and could have been shining into Mr Wright's eyes.The trial continues.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was accused of causing the death of a six-year-old girl, but the article does not mention the death of a child. Instead, it reports that Sylvia Blackburn, a 72-year-old woman, suffered serious head injuries.
2. The summary mentions a six-year-old girl, but the article only refers to Mrs. Blackburn, a lollipop lady, who was hit by a car.
3. The summary states that the man was jailed for six years, but the article does not mention the sentence or any conviction of the defendant.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains details that are not present in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that a man accused of causing the death of a six-year-old girl in a car crash has been jailed for six years.
2. However, the article states that Brian Wright, the accused, has not been jailed at the time of the article. He is on trial for causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The article mentions that Sylvia Blackburn, the victim, suffered serious head injuries but does not mention her death or the death of a six-year-old girl.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces incorrect information about the accused being jailed and the death of a six-year-old girl, which is not supported by the article.
