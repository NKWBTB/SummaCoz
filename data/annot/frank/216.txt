    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the UK Independence Party (UKIP) spent more than £100,000 on campaigning during the general election, but the article states that UKIP spent £2,956,737 on campaigning. This is a significant difference and indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.

2. The article provides specific figures for the campaign spending of each party, while the summary only mentions the amount spent by UKIP. This lack of information about the other parties' campaign spending suggests that the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content.

3. The article states that the six highest-spending parties spent a total of £9,347,087 on campaigning, but the summary does not mention this fact. This omission further suggests that the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content.

4. Finally, the article provides information about the cost per vote for each party, but the summary does not mention this information. This lack of information about the cost per vote suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's content.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only provides information about UKIP's campaign spending, lacks information about the other parties' campaign spending, and omits information about the cost per vote.
