Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that UKIP spent £2,956,737 on their campaign, while the summary states that they spent over £100,000.
2. The article provides a specific amount for UKIP's campaign spending, while the summary is a vague estimate.
3. The article states that the Electoral Commission provided the figures for campaign spending, while the summary does not provide any source for the information.
4. The article provides detailed information about the campaign spending of each party, including the amount spent and the number of votes received, while the summary only provides a summary of the campaign spending for UKIP.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides an inaccurate and vague estimate of UKIP's campaign spending, and does not provide any source for the information. The article provides specific and detailed information about the campaign spending of all the parties, which is not present in the summary.
