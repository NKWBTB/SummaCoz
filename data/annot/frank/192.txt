</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home." This means that 80% of children in England who eat school lunches have tried new foods at school that they did not have at home.
2. The summary states "one in five parents in England eat vegetables at home, a survey suggests." This implies that only 20% of parents in England eat vegetables at home.
3. However, the article states that "half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home." This means that 50% of parents questioned have had their children ask for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home, which suggests that the children are trying new foods at school.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that only 20% of parents in England eat vegetables at home, while the article suggests that 80% of children in England who eat school lunches have tried new foods at school that they did not have at home.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the information and suggests that only a small percentage of parents in England eat vegetables at home, while the article suggests that the majority of children in England who eat school lunches have tried new foods at school.
