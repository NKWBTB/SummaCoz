     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "one in five parents in England eat vegetables at home," but the article does not support this claim. The article only mentions that parents were asked about their children's eating habits, not their own.
2. The summary mentions that the most popular vegetables among parents were carrots, sweetcorn, and peas, but the article does not provide this information. The article only mentions that the researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.
3. The summary states that "half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home," but the article does not support this claim.

4. The summary mentions that the survey found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home, but the article does not provide this information.
