    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Aberdeen have appointed Paul Sheerin as their new manager on a two-year contract. However, the article states that Sheerin has been player-manager at Arbroath since 2010, not Aberdeen. This is a contradiction and indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The article states that Sheerin has been player-manager at Arbroath, and that he has replaced Neil Cooper at Pittodrie. However, the summary does not mention anything about Arbroath or Neil Cooper. This omission suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's content.
3. The article mentions that Sheerin guided Arbroath to their first national trophy in their history by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011. However, the summary does not mention this achievement. This lack of information suggests that the summary is not a comprehensive summary of the article's content.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important information and contains contradictory statements.
