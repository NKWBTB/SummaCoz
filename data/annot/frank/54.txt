Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Aberdeen have appointed Paul Sheerin as their new manager on a two-year contract, which is not consistent with the article.
2. The article states that Sheerin has been appointed as player-manager at Arbroath, not Aberdeen.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Sheerin's role as player-manager at Arbroath or his previous experience as a player for several Scottish clubs and Östersunds in Sweden.
4. The article mentions that Sheerin guided Arbroath to their first national trophy in their history by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011, which is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about Paul Sheerin's appointment as Arbroath's player-manager and his previous experience as a player and coach. The summary only mentions that Aberdeen have appointed Sheerin as their new manager, which is not supported by the article.
