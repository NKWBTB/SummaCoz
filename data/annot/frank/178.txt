</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Ireland ran in nine tries, which is not supported by the article. The article mentions that Ireland made 165-5 in Greater Noida, but there is no mention of nine tries.
2. The article states that Afghanistan won the match, not Ireland. The summary is incorrect in stating that Ireland won the match.
3. The article mentions that Ireland lost the match due to not executing things well with the ball, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that Afghanistan's Samiullah Shenwari and Mohammad Shahzad scored 56 and 47 runs respectively, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains several inaccuracies.
