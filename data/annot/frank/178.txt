    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ireland ran in nine tries, but the article does not mention anything about Ireland scoring tries. In fact, the article only mentions runs scored by Ireland and Afghanistan.
2. The summary states that Ireland beat Afghanistan in the final of the first Twenty20 international, but the article does not mention a final or any mention of the match being the final of a series.
3. The summary states that Ireland made 165-5, but the article states that Ireland made 165-5 in Greater Noida.
4. The summary states that Afghanistan made 171-4, but the article states that Afghanistan made 171-4 with two overs to spare.
5. The summary states that Samiullah Shenwari (56) and Mohammad Shahzad (47) helped the Afghans to 171-4, but the article states that Shahzad and Najeeb Tarakai (27) put on an opening stand of 51 as Afghanistan cruised to their victory target.
6. The summary states that Amir Hamza (2-23) was the only bowler to take more than one wicket, but the article states that Amir Hamza (2-23) was the only bowler to take more than one wicket on a day when the bat dominated.
7. The summary states that the loss of paceman Boyd Rankin for the T20s, because of a back problem, was another setback for the Irish on Wednesday, but the article does not mention anything about Boyd Rankin or his availability for the T20s or ODIs.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the provided summary is not consistent with the article.
