    Summary: 
    a man has been given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of drinking a bar at a bar in birmingham. 

    Article: 
    Paramedics were called to attend a sudden death at Joe's Bar in Dungiven at 06:00 BST on 6 October 2014, Limavady Magistrates Court was told.Police arriving a short time later found several people still at the bar.Till receipts showed alcohol was being served as late as 04:49 BST. The judge ordered its closure for three months.Colleen O'Neill, 43, of Kevin Lynch Park in the town, was charged with two counts of allowing the consumption of liquor outside licensing hours.James Thomas, 44, of the same address, faced one count of the same charge.A defence solicitor told the court that the licensing laws in Dungiven "were not strictly adhered to".He said it was clear that the premises had not been run in a proper manner and had been running well into the morning.The judge said Ms O'Neill, who is the license holder, had "an appalling record" and expressed concern that he did not have power to impose a custodial sentence."This was as bad a case as I have come across and as bad a record," he said.Ms O'Neill was also fined £3,000, while Mr Thomas was fined £1,000. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was given a suspended prison sentence, but the article does not mention anything about a prison sentence. Instead, the article states that the license holder, Colleen O'Neill, was fined £3,000 and her partner, James Thomas, was fined £1,000.
2. The summary also states that the man was found guilty of drinking at a bar, but the article does not mention anything about the man being found guilty of drinking. Instead, the article states that the bar was found to have been serving alcohol outside of licensing hours.
3. The summary does not mention the location of the bar, but the article states that the bar is located in Dungiven, Northern Ireland.
4. The summary does not mention the time of the incident, but the article states that the incident occurred at 06:00 BST on 6 October 2014.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information about the man being given a prison sentence, being found guilty of drinking, and the location and time of the incident. The article only mentions the fines imposed on the license holder and her partner, and the fact that the bar was found to have been serving alcohol outside of licensing hours.
