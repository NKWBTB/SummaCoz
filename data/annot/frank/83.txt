</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Sam Allardyce is the new England manager, indicating that he has not retired from international football.
2. The summary states that Allardyce has announced his retirement from international football, which is not supported by the article.
3. The article mentions that Allardyce won 61 caps for England and was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships, but the summary does not mention any of these achievements.
4. The article quotes Milner as saying "The decision we've reached is about common sense. I wish Sam [Allardyce], the players, staff and supporters success in the future," which suggests that Allardyce is still the England manager.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Allardyce has retired from international football, while the article indicates that he is still the England manager.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Sam Allardyce, the new England manager, has announced his retirement from international football.
2. However, the article states that it is James Milner, the former Manchester City player, who is retiring from international football. There is no mention of Sam Allardyce retiring from international football in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly attributes the retirement to Sam Allardyce instead of James Milner, the subject of the article.
