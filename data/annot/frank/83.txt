    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Sam Allardyce has announced his retirement from international football.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Allardyce retiring from international football. Instead, it talks about his career as an England player and his record for the most capped England Under-21 player.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Allardyce retiring from international football in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the summary contains information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions Allardyce retiring from international football, which is not mentioned in the article.
