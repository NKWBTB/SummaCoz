     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the assembly's assembly has approved a motion to pardon convictions for gay and bisexual men in England and Wales, while the article states that the motion will go before the assembly for approval. The article does not mention that the assembly has already approved the motion.
2. The summary mentions that the motion will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the motion will allow for pardons both posthumously and for living gay and bisexual men.
3. The summary states that the law will allow living men convicted of such offences to apply for a pardon, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the motion will contain the same provisions as the plans announced last month in England and Wales.
4. The summary quotes the justice minister as saying that arrangements will be brought in "as soon as possible to ensure that there is equal treatment for gay and bisexual men here as for their counterparts in England and Wales", but the article does not mention this quote.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the assembly's assembly has approved a motion to pardon convictions for gay and bisexual men in England and Wales.
2. However, the article does not mention any approval or motion being passed by the "assembly's assembly". Instead, the article discusses a proposal to bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales in granting pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, referred to as 'Turing's Law.' The article mentions that a motion is expected to be presented in the Northern Ireland Assembly for approval, but it does not confirm the approval itself.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary inaccurately suggesting that the Northern Ireland Assembly has already approved the motion, while the article deoe not mention such information and discusses the intention to propose such a motion for consideration.
