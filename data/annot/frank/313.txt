Derby County season ticket holders from the 2010-11 campaign might struggle to believe it but Alberto Bueno prepares to face his former club Real Madrid on Wednesday as the highest-scoring Spanish-national in La Liga with a big money move to Porto waiting for him at the end of the season. Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him. Alberto Bueno (left) in action for Derby against Norwich during his unsuccessful spell with the club Bueno celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Real Union in November 2008 Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season and could soon move to Porto AGE: 27 CLUBS (League record only) Real Madrid (2006-09): 97 apps, 22 goals Real Madrid (2008-09): 3 apps, 0 goals Valladolid (2009-13): 85 apps, 13 goals Derby (loan, 2010-11): 29 apps, 5 goals Rayo Vallecano (2013-) 65 apps, 26 goals Seventeen of the 35 goals that Rayo have scored this season have come from Bueno. He hit four in one game earlier this year against Levante and will be gunning for his old club on Wednesday night. Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madridâ€™s youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain. Negredo and Soldado both made it into the Spain squad after they succeeded away from Madrid and national team boss Vicente Del Bosque will be watching on Wednesday when Bueno goes up against Sergio Ramos as Rayo Vallecano look to take the scalp of Real Madrid in their rickety atmosphere-charged three-sided Vallecas stadium.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Number of goals scored: The summary states that Alberto Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season, but the article states that he has scored 26 goals for the club since joining in 2013.
2. Time period: The summary only mentions this season, implying that Bueno has only been playing for Rayo Vallecano this year. However, the article states that he has been playing for the club since 2013, which is a longer period of time.
3. Loan spell: The summary mentions that Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Bueno played for Valladolid after leaving Real Madrid, and then joined Rayo Vallecano.
4. Move to Porto: The summary states that Porto are ready to poach Bueno at the end of the season, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Bueno could soon move to Porto because of his good form for Rayo Vallecano.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only provides a limited number of facts about Bueno's time at Rayo Vallecano and does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Alberto Bueno has scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season and that Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago with five goals in 29 games.
2. However, the article states that Alberto Bueno has indeed scored 17 goals for Rayo Vallecano this season. Still, it also provides more context about his time at Derby County, mentioning that he had just five goals in 29 games during that loan spell. The summary incorrectly suggests that Bueno's success with 17 goals this season was related to his time at Derby, which is not supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which connects Bueno's current goal-scoring performance to his time at Derby, while the article separates these two periods and their goal-scoring outcomes.
