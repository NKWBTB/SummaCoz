</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article is about a fire that occurred at a disused waste site in Duncan Street, Greater Manchester, while the summary is about a fire that destroyed a waste site in Eamonn, County Down. The two locations are different, and the summary does not match the article.
2. The article mentions that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste, and that the company is no longer able to operate from the site after August 7. The summary does not mention anything about the Environment Agency or any enforcement action.
3. The article states that the fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport, and the environment. The summary does not mention any concerns raised by the fire service or any potential impact of the fire.
4. The article mentions that the cause of the fire remains undetermined, while the summary does not mention anything about the cause of the fire.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the same event or situation. The summary is about a fire in Eamonn, County Down, while the article is about a fire in Duncan Street, Greater Manchester. Additionally, the summary does not mention any of the key details mentioned in the article, such as the Environment Agency's enforcement action, the fire service's concerns, or the cause of the fire.
