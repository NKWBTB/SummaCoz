</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that children who eat healthily are too fussy to eat healthily. This is not supported by the article, as the article states that children are trying new foods and increasing the variety of foods in their diet.
2. The summary also implies that children are being forced to eat healthily, which is not supported by the article. The article states that children are trying new foods and increasing the variety of foods in their diet, but it does not suggest that they are being forced to do so.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it presents a negative view of healthy eating, implying that children who eat healthily are fussy and being forced to do so. The article, on the other hand, presents a positive view of healthy eating, highlighting the benefits of school meals and the variety of foods available.
4. The summary is also not accurate, as it suggests that children are being cooked and cooked, which is not a valid statement.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article and is not an accurate representation of the information presented.
