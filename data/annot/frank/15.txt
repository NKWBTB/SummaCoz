    Summary: 
    the turkey co-founder bernard matthews has been given the green light by the unite union. 

    Article: 
    The turkey firm was sold to the food tycoon Ranjit Boparan on Tuesday.There had been fears that the new owners would not take on the existing workers' pension scheme.But Unite regional officer Steve Harley said: "We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured."Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover.The Boparan Private Office, the "chicken king" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.Mr Harley met with representatives from Boparan at the Great Witchingham headquarters.He said: "It was made clear that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business."This would be achieved by greater investment in the business, cost savings and utilising the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just turkeys." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Bernard Matthews has been given the green light by the Unite union. However, the article states that the Unite union has given guarantees that all current agreements will be honored, but it does not mention anything about Bernard Matthews being given the green light.
2. The summary mentions that the turkey co-founder Bernard Matthews has been given the green light, which is not accurate according to the article. The article only mentions that the Unite union has given guarantees that all current agreements will be honored, but it does not mention anything about Bernard Matthews being given the green light.
3. The article states that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership, but the summary does not mention anything about pension arrangements.
4. The article mentions that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business, but the summary does not mention anything about this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions things that are not in the article, such as Bernard Matthews being given the green light, and leaves out important information, such as the continuation of the current pension arrangements and the new owner's plans to restore the company to its former position.
