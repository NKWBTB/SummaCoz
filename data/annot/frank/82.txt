</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Sam Allardyce is the former manager of Manchester City, and that he won 61 caps for England.
2. The summary states that Sam Allardyce has signed a new four-year deal with England Women's Super League One club.
3. These two statements are contradictory, as Sam Allardyce is a male and the England Women's Super League One is a women's football league. It is not possible for Sam Allardyce to sign a deal with the women's league.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is likely that the summary is incorrect or misleading.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Sam Allardyce has signed a new four-year deal with England Women's Super League One club, replacing him at the end of the season.
2. However, the article does not mention Sam Allardyce signing a deal with England Women's Super League One club, and it focuses on James Milner's decision to retire from international football. There is no information about Sam Allardyce or his involvement in the women's league in the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces unrelated information and misinterprets the content of the article.
