    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Sam Allardyce has signed a new four-year deal with England Women's Super League One club, replacing him at the end of the season.

This is not consistent with the article because:

2. The article states that Sam Allardyce is a former Manchester City player, and there is no mention of him signing a new deal with England Women's Super League One club.

3. The article also states that Allardyce won 61 caps for England, but there is no mention of him replacing anyone at the end of the season.

4. The summary is referring to a new deal, which is not mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
