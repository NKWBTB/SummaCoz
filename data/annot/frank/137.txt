Armed police sealed off the area.The victim was taken to Northern General hospital but died from his injuries.Local residents said the man was a member of a family who live close to the scene of the shooting.They said relatives had been gathering for a family celebration when the attack occurred.Many came out of the house to try to help him after hearing the shot, neighbours said.There have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, although all the previous incidents have been in the north of the city and not close to the Upperthorpe area.On Monday, a 25-year-old man was seriously injured when he was shot in the street in the Shiregreen area.Earlier this month, an elderly couple were left shocked when shots were fired through their living room window in the Southey Green area - an incident police believe was a case of mistaken identity.In January shots were fired at houses in two separate incidents in the same street in High Green. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was shot in the head, but the article states that he was shot in the chest. This is a inconsistency, as the article does not mention anything about the man being shot in the head.
2. The summary also states that the man was in critical condition, but the article does not mention his current medical condition. The article only states that he was taken to the hospital and died from his injuries.
3. The summary mentions that the shooting occurred in north Belfast, but the article does not mention the location of the shooting. The article only states that the shooting occurred in Upperthorpe, which is a different location.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistencies are:

* The man was shot in the head, but the article only mentions a gunshot wound to the chest.
* The summary states that the man was in critical condition, but the article does not mention his current medical condition.
* The summary mentions north Belfast, but the article only mentions Upperthorpe.
