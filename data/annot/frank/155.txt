    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that all images are copyrighted, but the article does not mention anything about images being copyrighted. In fact, the article only mentions videos and band interviews being available online.
2. The summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that all content on the festival's app is copyrighted, while the article only mentions specific types of content (videos and band interviews) being available.
3. The article does not mention anything about copyrighted images, so the summary is not supported by the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is not an accurate representation of the information provided in the article.
