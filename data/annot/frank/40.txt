a cat has died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park, the rspca has confirmed.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the cat died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park.
2. The article does not mention anything about the cat eating antifreeze in a car park. Instead, it states that the cat ingested the toxic substance near Victor Avenue in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.
3. The article also mentions that the RSPCA is unsure whether the poisonings were accidental or deliberate, while the summary implies that the poisoning was deliberate.
4. The article provides more details about the other cats that have died in the area, including the fact that they died over the past seven days and that Meereen was the most recent victim. The summary does not mention these additional details.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details, provides misleading information, and implies deliberate poisoning when the article states that the cause of death is unclear.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that a cat has died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park, as confirmed by the RSPCA.
2. However, the article does not specifically mention that the cat died after eating antifreeze in a car park. It mentions that cats in the area had ingested a toxic substance, but the article doesn't provide details about the specific location or circumstances of the poisoning.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which adds specific details about the cat's death that are not present in the article.
