     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the cat died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park, but the article does not mention the cat eating antifreeze in a car park. Instead, the article states that the cat ingested the toxic substance near Victor Avenue in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.
2. The summary does not mention that three other cats in the area have died in the last seven days, and another cat died two weeks ago, as stated in the article.
3. The summary does not mention the RSPCA inspector's appeal for people in the area to ensure pesticides and chemicals were stored safely, as stated in the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article. It only mentions one aspect of the article (the cat's death from antifreeze poisoning) and leaves out other important details.
