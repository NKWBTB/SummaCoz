    Summary: 
    the inquests into the deaths of 96 football fans in the hillsborough disaster will be reviewed in the wake of the hillsborough inquests. 

    Article: 
    The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives at 11:00 BST.Ninety-six football fans were fatally injured in the 1989 stadium disaster.Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son died, said: "Hopefully this is the journey to the end, completely, of Hillsborough."Last year, new inquests into the disaster in Sheffield concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed.In January, files of evidence relating to 23 suspects were referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought.Of these, 15 relate to the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster, which unfolded at the start of an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.The other eight relate to an Independent Police Complaints Commission probe into the conduct of both South Yorkshire Police and West Midlands Police in the days and weeks afterwards.Relatives have been invited to a private meeting in Warrington, where they will be informed of the decisions by Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the CPS.Mrs Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said waiting for the decisions had been "a long, long struggle for everybody".She added: "We've got to wait with anticipation to see what happens."It is going to be a day of mixed emotions for the families and we have had so many of them."Whatever happens, I still think it will be a long road, but the families are determined to never give up."All we want is accountability, nothing more and nothing less."

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "inquests into the deaths of 96 football fans" while the article does not mention inquests at all. Instead, it talks about the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) revealing its intentions regarding charges to be brought against suspects.
2. The summary implies that the inquests are ongoing, while the article states that the CPS will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives. This suggests that the inquests have already concluded and the CPS is now considering charges.
3. The summary mentions "the Hillsborough disaster" without specifying that it is talking about the 1989 stadium disaster. The article, on the other hand, clearly states that the disaster occurred in 1989.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the CPS reviewing the inquests, while the article states that the CPS will reveal its intentions based on the evidence presented in the inquests.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to inquests that are not mentioned in the article, implies that the inquests are ongoing, and does not specify the correct date of the disaster.
