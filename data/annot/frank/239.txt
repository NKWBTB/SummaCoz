The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives at 11:00 BST.Ninety-six football fans were fatally injured in the 1989 stadium disaster.Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son died, said: "Hopefully this is the journey to the end, completely, of Hillsborough."Last year, new inquests into the disaster in Sheffield concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed.In January, files of evidence relating to 23 suspects were referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought.Of these, 15 relate to the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster, which unfolded at the start of an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.The other eight relate to an Independent Police Complaints Commission probe into the conduct of both South Yorkshire Police and West Midlands Police in the days and weeks afterwards.Relatives have been invited to a private meeting in Warrington, where they will be informed of the decisions by Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the CPS.Mrs Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said waiting for the decisions had been "a long, long struggle for everybody".She added: "We've got to wait with anticipation to see what happens."It is going to be a day of mixed emotions for the families and we have had so many of them."Whatever happens, I still think it will be a long road, but the families are determined to never give up."All we want is accountability, nothing more and nothing less."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives regarding the Hillsborough disaster.
2. The article mentions that new inquests into the disaster concluded that the fans had been unlawfully killed, and that files of evidence relating to 23 suspects were referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought.
3. The summary states that the inquests into the deaths of 96 football fans in the Hillsborough disaster will be reviewed.

The reasoning behind why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the article does not mention anything about the inquests being reviewed. Instead, it focuses on the CPS's intentions and the possibility of charges being brought against suspects. The summary is therefore not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that the inquests into the deaths of 96 football fans in the Hillsborough disaster will be reviewed.
2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article focuses on the CPS's upcoming meeting with victims' relatives to inform them of the decisions regarding potential charges, rather than a review of the inquests.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests a review of the inquests, while the article primarily focuses on the CPS's decisions regarding charges related to the disaster.
