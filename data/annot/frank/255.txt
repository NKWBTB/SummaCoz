    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a search is under way for a man who has been missing since last month. 

    Article: 
    Trevor Deely, 22, was last seen walking home from a Christmas party in December 2000.A search of a site in Chapelizod in Dublin started early on Saturday morning, Irish national broadcaster, RTÉ reports.The area is three acres of Woodlands beside the R112 which runs down to the River Liffey.Gardaí said the search will involve excavations and is expected to take a number of weeks.Earlier this year a team of six detectives began conducting a complete review of Mr Deely's disappearance.CCTV footage from the night he went missing was enhanced using specialist technology.It shows Mr Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street, where he worked.It is understood he was returning to get an umbrella after the party.Detectives released the footage in April and appealed for the man to come forward.They believe he was the same man captured on CCTV following Mr Deely, who was from County Kildare in the Republic of Ireland, a short time later on Haddington Road.On Saturday gardaí said the man seen in the CCTV has not yet been identified and they renewed their appeal for him to come forward. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a search is underway for a man who has been missing since last month, but the article states that Trevor Deely went missing in December 2000, not last month.
2. The summary does not mention anything about a search, while the article states that a search of a site in Chapelizod, Dublin started early on Saturday morning.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the man being from County Kildare or the CCTV footage, while these details are included in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the man being dressed in black, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information provided in the article, and some of the information it does include is incorrect (e.g. the time frame and location of the disappearance).
