Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Trevor Deely was last seen walking home from a Christmas party in December 2000, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that he has been missing since last month.
2. The article mentions that a search is underway in a specific location in Dublin, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the man being searched for, while the article mentions that detectives are looking for a man dressed in black who was captured on CCTV following Trevor Deely.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the man has not yet been identified, while the article mentions that the man seen in the CCTV has not yet been identified and that detectives have renewed their appeal for him to come forward.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it does not provide accurate information about the missing person or the search efforts.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that the article is about a search for a man who has been missing since last month.
2. However, the article is about the search for Trevor Deely, who was last seen in December 2000, which is more than two decades ago, not last month. The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, the area being searched in Dublin, the involvement of the Irish police (Gardaí), and the release of CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that the individual went missing last month, while the article is specific to Trevor Deely, who went missing in December 2000.
