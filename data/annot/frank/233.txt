    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions Daisy Potts, but the article does not mention any actor by that name.
2. The summary states that the actor will star in the live-action remake of the Disney film, but the article does not mention a live-action remake. The article only mentions a film adaptation of the animated movie.
3. The summary mentions Mrs. Potts being transformed into a teapot, but the article does not mention anything about Mrs. Potts being a teapot. In fact, the article mentions that Mrs. Potts will be played by Dame Angela Lansbury, who voiced the character in the 1991 animated version.
4. The summary mentions Emma Watson as Belle, but the article does not mention her name. The article only mentions that the actress who will play Belle has not been confirmed.
5. The summary mentions Luke Evans as Gaston, but the article does not mention his name. The article only mentions that the villainous Gaston will be played by an unnamed actor.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not mentioned in the article, such as Daisy Potts and the live-action remake, and omits information that is mentioned in the article, such as Emma Watson and Luke Evans.
