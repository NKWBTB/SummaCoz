<Summary>
star wars actress daisy potts is to star in disney\'s live-action remake of the disney film.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "star wars actress Daisy Potts is to star in Disney's live-action remake of the Disney film."
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Star Wars or Daisy Potts.
3. The article does mention Emma Watson, who will play the role of Belle, and Dan Stevens, who will play the Beast.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions a different actress (Daisy Potts) and a different film (Star Wars) than the article.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the information in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that star wars actress daisy potts is to star in Disney's live-action remake of the Disney film.
2. However, the article provides information about the cast of Disney's live-action adaptation of "Beauty and the Beast." It mentions Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad, along with their respective roles. There is no mention of "Daisy Potts" in the article, and the article does not connect "star wars actress" to any character in the movie.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, where it introduces a character named "Daisy Potts" and associates her with "star wars actress," which is not supported by the article. The actual cast and characters are different, and the article does not mention any actress by that name in relation to "Beauty and the Beast."
