</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Sarah Storey won the women's road race in Nottwil, Switzerland, but the summary only mentions that she won her second gold medal of the para-cycling road world championships. This is inconsistent, as the article does not mention any other gold medals won by Storey.
2. The article states that Storey finished more than two minutes ahead of Poland's Anna Harkowska, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The summary states that Storey won her second gold medal, implying that she had already won one gold medal before this race. However, the article does not mention any other gold medals won by Storey.
4. The article states that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary should have mentioned Storey's victory in the women's road race, her dominance in the race, and her target of further Paralympic success in Rio de Janeiro.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Paralympic champion Sarah Storey won her second gold medal of the para-cycling road world championships in the women's road race in Switzerland.
2. However, the article does not mention Sarah Storey winning her second gold medal at the para-cycling road world championships or participating in the women's road race. The article mentions her victory in Nottwil, Switzerland, and her potential to win a 17th title in the road race.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which attributes specific details not present in the article.
