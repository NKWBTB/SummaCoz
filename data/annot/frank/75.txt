    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Sarah Storey won her second gold medal of the para-cycling road world championships, but the article does not mention any gold medals won by Storey in the para-cycling road world championships. Instead, the article states that Storey won the women's road race in Switzerland.
2. The summary mentions that Storey won her second gold medal, implying that she had already won one gold medal before the women's road race in Switzerland. However, the article does not mention any previous gold medals won by Storey.
3. The summary states that Storey won the women's road race in Switzerland, but the article does not mention any specific event or race won by Storey. Instead, the article mentions that Storey finished more than two minutes ahead of Poland's Anna Harkowska in Nottwil, Switzerland.
4. The summary mentions that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the article does not mention anything about the Paralympics or Rio de Janeiro.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions events and details that are not present in the article.
