We could have added another 15 and gotten up to the 180 we were looking for," said Porterfield."As well as we played I thought we just came up short with the ball. We didn't quite execute things as well as we would have liked."The loss of paceman Boyd Rankin for the T20s, because of a back problem, was another setback for the Irish on Wednesday.Rankin is expected to return for the five ODIs against Afghanistan, starting on 15 March. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ireland lost to Afghanistan in the second T20 match, but the article does not mention any such loss.
2. The article states that Ireland made 165-5 in Greater Noida, but the summary does not mention this score.
3. The article states that Afghanistan made 171-4, but the summary does not mention this score either.
4. The article mentions that Samiullah Shenwari and Mohammad Shahzad scored 56 and 47 runs respectively for Afghanistan, but the summary does not mention their names or their scores.
5. The article mentions that Amir Hamza took 2 wickets for Afghanistan, but the summary does not mention any bowlers or their wicket-taking performances.
6. The article states that the sides will meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
