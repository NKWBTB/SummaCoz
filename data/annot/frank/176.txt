ireland lost to afghanistan in the second of the three-match twenty20 series in india on tuesday.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ireland lost to Afghanistan in the second T20 match.
2. However, the article states that Afghanistan won the match, not Ireland.
3. The article mentions that Ireland made 165-5, while the summary states that Ireland lost.
4. The article also mentions that Afghanistan made 171-4, which is higher than Ireland's score.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it incorrectly states that Ireland lost the match when, in fact, Afghanistan won.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states the winner of the match.
