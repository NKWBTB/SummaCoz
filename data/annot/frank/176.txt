We didn't quite execute things as well as we would have liked."The loss of paceman Boyd Rankin for the T20s, because of a back problem, was another setback for the Irish on Wednesday.Rankin is expected to return for the five ODIs against Afghanistan, starting on 15 March.

<Summary>
ireland lost to afghanistan in the second of the three-match twenty20 series in india on tuesday.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ireland lost to Afghanistan in the second T20 match.
2. However, the article states that Afghanistan won the match, not Ireland.
3. The article mentions that Ireland made 165-5, while the summary states that Ireland lost.
4. The article also mentions that Afghanistan made 171-4, which is higher than Ireland's score.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it incorrectly states that Ireland lost the match when, in fact, Afghanistan won.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states the winner of the match.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Ireland lost to Afghanistan in the second of the three-match Twenty20 series in India on Tuesday.
2. However, the article provides details of a cricket match between Ireland and Afghanistan but does not specify the format as a Twenty20 match, and it does not mention the specific date of Tuesday. The article does not provide information about this being the second match of a three-match series, and it does not specify the location as India.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies specific details about the format of the match, the day it occurred, and its place, which are not supported by the article's content. The article provides general information about a cricket match but lacks the specific details mentioned in the summary.
