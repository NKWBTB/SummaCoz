But if you show like today that you cannot cope with the pressure then it is difficult to challenge and fight for the Premier League."Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day"I couldn't believe what I was watching, they had the best defensive record last season and the joint best this year, but they were all over the place. Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today, but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three."It was so unlike Spurs, they do so well at home, but the contrast is amazing. There's a lack of pace, and a different mindset when they go away from home. They have to improve and quickly."

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Pochettino said he is "sad" and not ready to fight for the Premier League title again, but the article does not mention anything about Pochettino being sad. Instead, the article quotes Pochettino as saying that his team is not ready to fight for the Premier League title.
2. The summary implies that Pochettino is disappointed with his team's performance, but the article states that Pochettino is disappointed with his team's lack of desire to play for a win.
3. The summary mentions that Pochettino said it is difficult to fight for the Premier League title if his team shows a lack of desire to play for a win, but the article does not mention Pochettino saying this exact phrase. Instead, the article quotes Pochettino as saying that it is difficult to fight for the Premier League if his team shows the lack of desire that they showed in the game.
4. The summary states that Pochettino added that if Chelsea go 12 points clear, it is a big problem, but the article does not mention Pochettino saying this. Instead, the article quotes Pochettino as saying that if Chelsea extend their lead at the top, it will be a big problem.
5. The summary implies that Pochettino is blaming his team's poor away form for their inability to fight for the Premier League title, but the article does not mention Pochettino blaming his team's away form. Instead, the article states that Pochettino is disappointed with his team's lack of desire to play for a win.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates Pochettino's comments and adds some information that is not present in the article.
