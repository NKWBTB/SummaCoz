But if you show like today that you cannot cope with the pressure then it is difficult to challenge and fight for the Premier League."Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day"I couldn't believe what I was watching, they had the best defensive record last season and the joint best this year, but they were all over the place. Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today, but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three."It was so unlike Spurs, they do so well at home, but the contrast is amazing. There's a lack of pace, and a different mindset when they go away from home. They have to improve and quickly."

<Summary>
mauricio pochettino says he is " sad " not ready to fight for the premier league title again after his side\'s 2-1
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Mauricio Pochettino said he is "sad" and not ready to fight for the Premier League title again.
2. However, the article does not mention Pochettino using the word "sad" or expressing any sentiment related to being ready to fight for the title.
3. The article does quote Pochettino as saying "If you start a game like we start then it is very difficult," and "If Chelsea go 12 points clear, it is a big problem."
4. These quotes suggest that Pochettino is disappointed with his team's performance and acknowledges the challenge of catching up with Chelsea at the top of the table.
5. However, the quotes do not convey the same level of frustration or despair as the word "sad" might suggest.
6. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it misrepresents Pochettino's words and tone.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that "Mauricio Pochettino says he is 'sad' not ready to fight for the Premier League title again after his side's 2-1."
2. The article mentions Mauricio Pochettino's comments about his team's performance in the Premier League but does not directly quote him as saying he is "sad" or explicitly stating that he is not ready to fight for the Premier League title again.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary paraphrasing Pochettino's sentiment in a way that is not directly supported by his quoted statements in the article. It simplifies his remarks and may not fully capture his feelings or intentions regarding the Premier League title race.
