We receive about five or six calls a day about this," he said.Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015).A council spokesman said: "Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence."The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "more than 1,000 people have signed a petition calling for a ban on the sale of homes in southampton." However, the article does not mention anything about a petition or a ban on the sale of homes.
2. The article focuses on the issue of unlicensed HMOs (Houses of Multiple Occupation) in Southampton and the efforts of the Southampton City Council to license these properties. The article mentions that landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence, but it does not mention anything about a ban on the sale of homes.
3. The summary's mention of a petition and a ban on the sale of homes is not supported by the article. The article only discusses the issue of unlicensed HMOs and the efforts of the Southampton City Council to address this issue.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement about the petition and the ban on the sale of homes is not accurate.
