The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career.

'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Robert Hardy is selling his collection of antiques, including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt, but the article does not mention anything about a diorama.
2. The summary mentions that the actor is selling his collection due to downsizing, but the article does not provide any reason for why he is selling his possessions.
3. The summary states that the actor is selling paintings, furniture, swords, flintlock rifles, silverware, and crystal chandeliers, but the article only mentions a few specific items such as a longbow, a painting of the actor holding a longbow, and a diorama.
4. The summary mentions that the auction is taking place on Saturday, but the article does not provide a specific date for the auction.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes items and details that are not mentioned in the article, and it omits other important information that is provided in the article.
