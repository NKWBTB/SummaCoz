The "black box" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats.Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing.Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit.An analysis is expected to be released next week.The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response.Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace.Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of "creeping Islamisation".What we know about how the Su-24 was downedHow Russia's sanctions could hit TurkeyThe war of words as it eruptedThe two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group.The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November.Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued.A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground.Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey in response to the downing of a Russian jet in Syria. The sanctions include a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.
2. However, the summary states that the Russian foreign ministry has suspended all sanctions against Turkey.
3. This is inconsistent with the article, as the article states that Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey, not suspended them.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

So, the reason for the inconsistency is that the summary states that Russia has suspended all sanctions against Turkey, while the article states that Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that "the Russian Foreign Ministry says it has suspended all sanctions against Turkey after a Russian jet crashed in Syria."
2. However, the article does not mention the Russian Foreign Ministry suspending all sanctions against Turkey due to a Russian jet crashing in Syria. The article primarily discusses the downing of a Russian Su-24 jet near the Turkish-Syrian border, the resulting tensions between Russia and Turkey, and the sanctions imposed by Russia on Turkey. It does not mention the suspension of sanctions in the manner described in the summary.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly portrays the Russian Foreign Ministry suspending all sanctions against Turkey in response to a Russian jet crashing in Syria, which is not what the article reports.
