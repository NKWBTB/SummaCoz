    Summary: 
    cardiff blues maintained their 100% start to the european challenge cup with a bonus-point win over gloucester. 

    Article: 
    A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded.Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win.The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties.More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up.However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break.Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.Gloucester: Marshall; Sharples, Trinder, Twelvetrees, May; Burns, Heinz (capt); McAllister, Hibbard, Hohneck, Savage, Thrush, Moriarty, Rowan, Morgan.Replacements: Matu'u, Thomas, Afoa, Galarza, Ludlow, Braley, Atkinson, Purdy.Cardiff Blues: Morgan; Cuthbert, Lee-Lo, Shingler, Scully; Anscombe, Williams; Jenkins (capt), Dacey, Filise, Earle, Hoeata, Warburton, Navidi, Williams.Replacements: Rees, Domachowski, Assiratti, Cook, Bennett, Williams, Halaholo, Summerhill.Referee: Pascal Gauzere (France)For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.

     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Cardiff Blues maintained their 100% start to the European Challenge Cup, but the article states that they failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010. This is a contradictory statement, as if they had maintained their 100% start, they would have progressed beyond the last eight.
2. The summary states that Cardiff Blues won the game, but the article states that Gloucester won the game. This is a clear inconsistency, as the article states that Gloucester won the game, while the summary states that Cardiff Blues won.
3. The summary states that Cardiff Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that Gloucester scored four tries in the second half to seal the win.
4. The summary states that the game was a seesawing opening 40 minutes, with scores locked on four separate occasions, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the game was a tight contest, with both sides trading penalties and tries.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains contradictory statements and omits important details. It is important to ensure that all information in a summary is supported by the article to maintain accuracy and consistency.
