<Summary>
hungary\'s prime minister, viktor orban, has warned that a new european law on human rights should be lifted.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has warned that a new European law on human rights should be lifted.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a new European law on human rights. Instead, it mentions that the EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law.
3. The article also states that Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. Specifically, the summary mentions a new European law on human rights, which is not mentioned in the article.
5. Additionally, the article does not mention Viktor Orban warning about lifting any laws, but rather the EU objecting to Hungary's policies and the Hungarian government being under pressure to withdraw the laws.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the content of the article by mentioning a new European law on human rights that does not exist, and by attributing a warning about lifting laws to Viktor Orban, which is not present in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has warned that a new European law on human rights should be lifted.
2. However, the article does not attribute any statement to Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban regarding a new European law on human rights. Instead, it quotes Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Peter Szijjarto, expressing Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and its objections to specific EU objections related to asylum seekers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and a higher education law. The article also mentions the concerns raised by EU institutions but does not mention a new European law on human rights or any statement from Prime Minister Viktor Orban on this specific topic.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, attributing statements to Hungary's Prime Minister that are not supported by the article and mischaracterizing the content of the article.
