     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that a cat died after being hit by a charity, but the article does not mention anything about a charity hitting the cat. Instead, the article states that the cat died after ingesting antifreeze.
2. The summary mentions that the cat died on Monday, but the article states that the cat died three days after being taken to the vet, which is not the same as Monday.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the other cats in the area that have died, while the article states that three other cats in the area have died in the last seven days and another cat died two weeks ago.
4. The summary does not mention the RSPCA inspector's appeal for people to ensure pesticides and chemicals were stored safely, which is a significant part of the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important information.
