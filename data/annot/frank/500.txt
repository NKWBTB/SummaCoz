A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, "Wow!"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the laser treatment will "tighten skin and improve facial skin." However, the article states that the treatment is a two-step process that provides a deep clean for the skin, and that it may cause unpleasant side effects such as blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and hyperpigmentation, and swelling.
2. The summary does not mention the potential risks and side effects of the treatment, which are clearly outlined in the article.
3. The summary states that the treatment will leave the skin "glowing" after just ten minutes, but the article does not mention any specific benefits or improvements to the skin after the treatment.
4. The summary mentions that the clinic has a "new" laser treatment, but the article does not specify when the treatment was introduced or if it is a new technology.
5. The summary does not mention the name of the clinic, while the article clearly states that the treatment is offered at Skin Laundry in Manhattan.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the potential risks and side effects of the treatment, and it does not provide specific information about the clinic or the treatment. The summary is too general and does not provide enough information to give a clear understanding of the treatment.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that a New York City skin clinic's new laser treatment is set to tighten skin and improve facial skin treatments. Skin Laundry claims that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave the skin 'glowing'.
2. However, the article states that the laser treatment involves clients signing a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner. The summary does not mention this significant aspect of the procedure.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary focuses solely on the positive aspects of the laser treatment, such as tightening and improving facial skin, without addressing the key element of the waiver and the release of personal information mentioned in the article.
