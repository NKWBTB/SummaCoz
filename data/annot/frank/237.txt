    Summary: 
    the crown prosecution service (cps) will be charged over the hillsborough disaster, the crown prosecution service has announced. 

    Article: 
    The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives at 11:00 BST.Ninety-six football fans were fatally injured in the 1989 stadium disaster.Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son died, said: "Hopefully this is the journey to the end, completely, of Hillsborough."Last year, new inquests into the disaster in Sheffield concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed.In January, files of evidence relating to 23 suspects were referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought.Of these, 15 relate to the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster, which unfolded at the start of an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.The other eight relate to an Independent Police Complaints Commission probe into the conduct of both South Yorkshire Police and West Midlands Police in the days and weeks afterwards.Relatives have been invited to a private meeting in Warrington, where they will be informed of the decisions by Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the CPS.Mrs Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said waiting for the decisions had been "a long, long struggle for everybody".She added: "We've got to wait with anticipation to see what happens."It is going to be a day of mixed emotions for the families and we have had so many of them."Whatever happens, I still think it will be a long road, but the families are determined to never give up."All we want is accountability, nothing more and nothing less." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will be charged over the Hillsborough disaster, but the article does not mention any charges being brought against the CPS. Instead, the article states that the CPS will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives.
2. The summary implies that the CPS is being charged for its role in the Hillsborough disaster, but the article does not support this. The CPS is not a party to the disaster, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was responsible for the tragedy.
3. The article focuses on the decisions that the CPS will make regarding potential charges against individuals related to the disaster, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it focuses on the CPS being charged, which is not accurate.
4. The summary uses language that is not supported by the article, such as "will be charged." This language implies a level of certainty that is not present in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the CPS's role in the Hillsborough disaster and implies that the CPS is being charged, which is not accurate. The article focuses on the decisions that the CPS will make regarding potential charges against individuals, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it uses language that is not supported by the article to create a misleading summary.
