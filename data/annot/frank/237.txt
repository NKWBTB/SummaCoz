The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives at 11:00 BST.Ninety-six football fans were fatally injured in the 1989 stadium disaster.Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son died, said: "Hopefully this is the journey to the end, completely, of Hillsborough."Last year, new inquests into the disaster in Sheffield concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed.In January, files of evidence relating to 23 suspects were referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought.Of these, 15 relate to the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster, which unfolded at the start of an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.The other eight relate to an Independent Police Complaints Commission probe into the conduct of both South Yorkshire Police and West Midlands Police in the days and weeks afterwards.Relatives have been invited to a private meeting in Warrington, where they will be informed of the decisions by Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the CPS.Mrs Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said waiting for the decisions had been "a long, long struggle for everybody".She added: "We've got to wait with anticipation to see what happens."It is going to be a day of mixed emotions for the families and we have had so many of them."Whatever happens, I still think it will be a long road, but the families are determined to never give up."All we want is accountability, nothing more and nothing less."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives, but it does not mention anything about the CPS being charged.
2. The summary states that the CPS will be charged over the Hillsborough disaster. This is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of charges being brought against the CPS.
3. The article mentions that the CPS has been reviewing evidence relating to 23 suspects, but it does not mention any charges being brought against the CPS.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that the CPS will be charged, while the article does not mention any charges being brought against the CPS.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will be charged over the Hillsborough disaster, and this announcement has been made by the CPS.
2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses the CPS's upcoming meeting with victims' relatives to reveal its intentions regarding potential charges related to the Hillsborough disaster. It does not state that the CPS itself will be charged; instead, the CPS is responsible for considering charges against individuals in connection with the disaster.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which states that the CPS will be charged, whereas the article focuses on the CPS's role in deciding whether to bring charges against individuals in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.
