2. The article mentions that the project includes the refurbishment of the BBC studios, while the summary does not mention this. This indicates that the summary is not comprehensive and does not cover all aspects of the project.
3. The article states that the project aims to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination, while the summary does not mention this. This suggests that the summary is not providing a complete picture of the project's goals and objectives.
4. The article mentions that the theatre has been unused for decades and still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place, while the summary does not mention this. This suggests that the summary is not providing accurate information about the current state of the theatre.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide a comprehensive and accurate description of the project. It omits key details such as the cost of the project, the refurbishment of the BBC studios, and the theatre's current state.
