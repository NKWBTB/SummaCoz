    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a £1.8m restoration project will transform the east end of Haringey Theatre into a theatre, but the article does not mention any restoration project for the theatre. Instead, the article discusses the larger east wing restoration project that includes the theatre, studios, and the glazed east court.
2. The summary mentions that the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music, but the article only mentions theatrical performances, cinema screenings, and exhibitions in the glazed east court.
3. The summary states that the theatre has languished unused for decades, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.
4. The summary mentions that the Heritage Lottery Fund is contributing £18.8m towards the project, but the article only mentions that the Heritage Lottery Fund is contributing £18.8m towards the larger east wing restoration project.
5. The summary does not mention the £6.8m contribution from Haringey Council or the £1m fundraising target set by Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust, which are both mentioned in the article.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
