Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the theatre has been unused for decades, but the summary claims that it is reopening for the first time in over 50 years. This is a clear inconsistency, as the article does not mention the theatre being closed for 50 years.
2. The article explains that the theatre was built in 1875 and has been used for various forms of entertainment, including theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music. The summary does not provide any information about the history of the theatre or its previous uses.
3. The article mentions that the theatre and studios are part of a larger restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination. The summary does not mention this project or the fact that the theatre is part of a larger restoration effort.
4. The article states that the Heritage Lottery Fund is contributing £18.8m towards the project, and Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m. The summary does not mention any funding sources or the cost of the project.
5. Finally, the article mentions that the theatre still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place, but the summary does not provide any information about the theatre's current condition or its original features.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details about the theatre's history, its previous uses, and the larger restoration project. Additionally, the summary's claim that the theatre is reopening for the first time in over 50 years is not supported by the article.
