    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the theatre is reopening after more than 50 years, but the article states that the theatre has been unused for decades, which suggests that it has not been open for more than 50 years.
2. The summary mentions that the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music, but the article only mentions theatrical performances, cinema screenings, and exhibitions.
3. The summary does not mention the BBC studios, which are mentioned in the article as being part of the restoration project.
4. The summary states that the theatre will reopen in 2018 if funds are raised, but the article does not mention a specific date for the reopening.
5. The summary mentions that the entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of £26.6m, but the article only mentions the theatre and studios as part of the restoration project.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
