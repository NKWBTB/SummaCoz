    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that people will be able to watch digital information at next year's Celtic music festival.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about watching digital information. Instead, it talks about an app that will provide access to online material such as videos and band interviews.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that there will be a specific digital content to watch, whereas the article only mentions the app providing access to existing online material.
4. The article does mention that the app will provide an "augmented reality experience" and that people around the world can interact with the festival, but it does not mention any specific digital content to watch.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.
