</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that people will be able to watch digital information at next year's Celtic music festival.
2. The article does not mention anything about watching digital information. Instead, it talks about an app that will provide online information, videos, and band interviews.
3. The word "watch" implies that the information will be presented in a visual format, such as a video or a live stream. However, the article only mentions online material that can be viewed on phones and tablets, not a visual format.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the festival will feature digital information that can be watched, while the article only mentions online material that can be viewed on devices.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that "people will soon be able to watch digital information at next year's celtic music festival."
2. However, the article mentions that visitors to the Hebridean Celtic Festival, which is happening in the current year, not the next year, can use an app to trigger online information from items such as signs and posters on the festival site.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary providing a statement about "next year's festival," while the article discusses the current year's festival and the technology being used for it.
