Sir Peter Blake, who is now the prize's patron, won the junior title in 1961. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps to explain my reasoning:

Step 1: Identify the main points of the summary.
The summary states that the patron of the John Moores Painting Prize has died at the age of 83.

Step 2: Identify the main points of the article.
The article reports on the winner of the John Moores Painting Prize, which is a 76-year-old artist named Simpson. The article mentions that Simpson won the prize with his painting "Squint (19)" and provides quotes from the judge and Simpson himself.

Step 3: Compare the summary with the article.
The summary does not mention the name of the winner or any details about the painting that won the prize. Instead, it only mentions the age of the patron and their death. This is not consistent with the article, which focuses on the winner of the prize and their painting.

Step 4: Analyze why the summary is not consistent with the article.
The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any information about the winner of the prize or their painting. Instead, it focuses on the age of the patron, which is not a central aspect of the article. It appears that the summary was written based on a different article or source, or that there was a mistake in the summary.

Therefore, based on the steps above, we can conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any information about the winner of the prize or their painting, and instead focuses on the age of the patron.
