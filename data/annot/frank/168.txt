</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the optometrist is accused of manslaughter and that their conduct contributed to the death of a 10-year-old boy.
2. However, the article states that the optometrist, Honey Rose, is accused of gross negligence manslaughter, not manslaughter.
3. The article also states that Vinnie, the 10-year-old boy, died five months after a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich, and that the prosecution alleges that Ms. Rose's failure to detect swollen optic discs during the test was "criminal."
4. The article does not mention anything about the optometrist's conduct contributing to the death of the boy.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misstates the charges against the optometrist and implies that their conduct directly contributed to the death of the boy, whereas the article only alleges that Ms. Rose's failure to detect the swollen optic discs was "criminal."
