    Vincent Barker, known as Vinnie, died in July 2012, five months after he had a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich.The prosecution told Ipswich Crown Court the conduct of eye specialist Honey Rose, 35, was so far below the expected standard it was "criminal".Ms Rose denies a charge of gross negligence manslaughter.Read more on this story and other news from SuffolkJonathan Rees QC said the alleged failure of Ms Rose, of Newham, east London, to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test, and refer him on for further investigation, was "at the heart of the prosecution case".A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death, the court heard."The prosecution allege that Vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant, Ms Rose, done her job properly," he told the jury."Given the risk of death involved, her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent optometrist - that it was criminal."The trial continues. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the optometrist is accused of manslaughter, but the article does not mention any accusations of manslaughter. Instead, the article states that the prosecution alleges that the optometrist's conduct was so far below the expected standard that it was "criminal."
2. The summary mentions that the optometrist contributed to the death of a 10-year-old boy, but the article does not mention any direct causal link between the optometrist's conduct and the boy's death. The article states that the build-up of fluid in the boy's brain increased pressure in his skull and ultimately led to his death, but it does not attribute any direct blame to the optometrist.
3. The summary implies that the optometrist is being accused of gross negligence manslaughter, but the article does not mention any specific charges against the optometrist. Instead, the article states that the prosecution alleges that the optometrist's conduct was so far below the expected standard that it was "criminal."

Therefore, based on these discrepancies, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary makes accusations that are not supported by the article, and it implies specific charges that are not mentioned in the article.
