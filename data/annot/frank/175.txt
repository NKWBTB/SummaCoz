</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee.
2. However, the article states that the perpetrator, Clive Weatherhogg, was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity with a man, and intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.
3. The article does not mention anything about a 15-year-old girl being sexually abused.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
5. The article actually reports on a case of a man who was found guilty of coercing a woman into engaging in sexual activity with another person, and of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.
6. The summary does not provide any information about the specific charges that Weatherhogg was found guilty of, or the nature of the coercion or abuse that he was found to have engaged in.
7. As a result, the summary is not a accurate or complete representation of the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee.
2. However, the article does not mention that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. The article discusses Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister. The charges and sentences in the article are related to Clive Weatherhogg's actions, not those of a 15-year-old girl.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary' statement is not mentioned in the article.
