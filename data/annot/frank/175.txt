    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl, but the article does not mention anything about the victim's age.

2. The summary mentions that the man was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with another man, but the article only mentions that he filmed them having sex.

3. The summary states that the man sent a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day, but the article does not mention this.

4. The summary mentions that the man was placed on the sex offenders register, but the article only mentions that the judge said he would be sent to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with.

5. The summary states that the judge said she had to pass a sentence that reflected society's abhorrence at such conduct, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as the victim's age and the man sending a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister. Additionally, the summary mentions charges that are not mentioned in the article, such as coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with another man.
