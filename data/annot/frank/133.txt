Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "eastenders actress mitchell mitchell is to return to eastenders after the death of eastenders actress mitchell mitchell."
2. This statement is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention the death of an actress named Mitchell Mitchell.
3. The article actually states that Grant Mitchell, played by Ross Kemp, will return to EastEnders for a brief return after the character's mother, Peggy, is killed off.
4. The summary incorrectly states that the actress who plays Mitchell Mitchell is returning to the show after the character's death, when in fact it is the character Grant Mitchell who is returning.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains incorrect information.
