     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Mitchell Mitchell is returning to EastEnders after her death, which is not accurate. According to the article, Mitchell Mitchell (played by Dame Barbara Windsor) has already returned to the show and has been involved in emotional scenes as she says goodbye to her family before her death from cancer.
2. The summary mentions that Grant Mitchell is returning to the show, but the article does not mention anything about Grant's return. The article only mentions that Ross Kemp, who played Grant, will be returning to the show for a brief appearance to bring the Mitchell family together for the last time.
3. The summary implies that Grant is returning to the show to be reunited with his mother, but the article states that Grant's return is not related to his mother's storyline. Instead, Grant is returning to bring the Mitchell brothers together for the last time.
4. The summary mentions that Grant has been one of the soap's most memorable characters, but the article does not mention anything about Grant's memorable moments or storylines.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations about Grant Mitchell's return to EastEnders.
