     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Barcelona rejected a bid from Barcelona to sign Neymar from Barcelona. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of any bid from Barcelona to sign Neymar.

Step 2: The summary mentions that Barcelona paid £48.6m for Neymar, which is correct. However, the article states that Barcelona paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar, which is a different amount.

Step 3: The summary states that Neymar will have cost the club £106.8m, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions the amount of money that Barcelona paid for Neymar, without mentioning any additional costs.

Step 4: The summary mentions that Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations he misappropriated money, which is not mentioned in the article.

Step 5: The summary states that a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer, which is mentioned in the article. However, the article states that the club denies any wrongdoing and that the judge's ruling does not imply any wrongdoing on the part of Barcelona.

Step 6: The summary mentions that Barcelona made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros, which is not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations.
