Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, has suggested that smartphone use may be to blame for a drop in the number of times couples are having sex each month.
2. The article also states that research has revealed that the frequency with which Britons are having sex has been in decline since the emergence of the internet.
3. However, the summary states that Professor Spiegelhalter suggests that there is a "very big split" between public lives and private lives, which is not supported by the article.
4. The article does mention that Prof Spiegelhalter believes that the boundaries between home, work, and the outside world have become eroded, which may be contributing to the decline in sexual activity.
5. The summary also suggests that Britons are having sex less frequently since the emergence of the internet, which is supported by the article.
6. However, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it does not mention the potential factors contributing to the decline in sexual activity, such as the erosion of boundaries between home and work, and the increasing number of competing demands on people's time.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the content and ideas presented in the article.
