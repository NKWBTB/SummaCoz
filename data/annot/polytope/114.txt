     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the frequency of sex among Britons has been declining since the emergence of the internet. However, the article does not mention anything about the internet's impact on sexual activity. Instead, it suggests that smartphone use may be responsible for the decline.
2. The summary mentions Professor David Spiegelhalter revealing that a typical heterosexual couple is having sex three times a month. However, the article does not mention this specific figure or any other specific figures for the frequency of sex. Instead, it mentions that research has revealed a decline in sexual activity, without providing any specific numbers.
3. The summary states that the decline in sexual activity is due to the mixing of public and private lives, as people are constantly checking their emails. However, the article does not mention this as a possible explanation for the decline. Instead, it suggests that the increasing number of competing demands on our time may be responsible.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides specific figures and explanations that are not supported by the article.
