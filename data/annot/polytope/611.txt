Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo wants Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti to move to a new club.
2. However, the article states that Osvaldo wants Pirlo and Totti to join him at Boca Juniors, not move to a new club.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Boca Juniors or Argentina, while the article makes it clear that Osvaldo is urging Pirlo and Totti to join him at Boca Juniors.
4. The summary only mentions that Osvaldo has become an instant hit at his new club, scoring three goals in six games, but the article does not mention this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the information that Osvaldo wants Pirlo and Totti to join him at Boca Juniors, and it also omits important details such as the club he is currently playing for and his success there.
