Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that a suicide bomber detonated his explosives near a group of protesters in eastern Afghanistan, killing 17 people and wounding dozens more.
2. The article also mentions that an Afghan lawmaker was among the wounded.
3. However, the summary only states that the suicide bomber killed 17 people, without mentioning the lawmaker or the fact that dozens more were wounded.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information provided in the article. Specifically, it does not mention the lawmaker or the number of people wounded.
5. Additionally, the summary states "no other organization has so far claimed responsibility" twice, which is not present in the article.

So, the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content.
