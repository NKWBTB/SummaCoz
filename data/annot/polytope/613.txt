    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "no other organization has so far claimed responsibility" for the suicide bombing in eastern Afghanistan. However, the article states that the Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, denied his group's responsibility for the attack. This means that the Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack, which contradicts the summary.
2. The article states that the suicide bombing killed 17 people and wounded 64 others, but the summary only mentions 17 deaths without mentioning the number of wounded. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's information.
3. The article states that the protesters were on their way to join a larger rally against the provincial governor, but the summary does not mention this detail. This omission suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's information.
4. The article provides the names of several individuals, including the provincial police chief, an eyewitness, and a CNN reporter, but the summary does not mention any of these individuals. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details, contradicts the article's information, and does not provide a complete representation of the article's information.
