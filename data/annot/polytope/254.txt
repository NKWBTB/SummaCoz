    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the passenger filmed the driver and sent the video to the bus company along with a complaint. However, the article does not mention the passenger filming the driver. Instead, the article states that the driver was filmed by a passenger, but the footage was sent to the bus company by the company itself.
2. The summary states that the driver was "caught reading a newspaper while driving," but the article does not use that phrase. Instead, the article states that the driver was "flicking through pages of the newspaper while the bus was in motion."
3. The summary states that the driver "moves his head to get a good look at one of the pages" as the bus slows to a stop, but the article does not mention the driver moving his head. Instead, the article states that the driver was "holding the whole newspaper open over the steering wheel."
4. The summary states that the bus company's boss, Andrew Ritchie, called the driver an "idiot," but the article does not quote Mr. Ritchie using that word. Instead, the article quotes him as saying that the driver's actions were "bloody irresponsible behavior to the first degree" and "absolutely stupid."
5. Finally, the summary states that the driver would be disciplined, but the article does not mention any specific disciplinary action. Instead, the article states that Mr. Ritchie said the driver's actions were "embarrassing" and that the company would take action, but does not provide any details.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important details that are included in the article.
