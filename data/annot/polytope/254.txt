</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the driver was caught reading a newspaper while driving in Auckland, New Zealand.
2. The article states that the driver was caught reading a newspaper while driving in Auckland, New Zealand, but the location is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.
3. The article states that the driver was holding the newspaper open over the steering wheel, which is not mentioned in the summary.
4. The article quotes the boss of Ritchies Coachlines, Andrew Ritchie, as saying that the driver's actions were "bloody irresponsible behavior to the first degree" and that he was "absolutely amazed by how absolutely stupid the guy is."
5. The summary does not include any quotes from Andrew Ritchie or any language that suggests the driver's actions were particularly irresponsible or stupid.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information in the article, specifically the location of the incident, the driver's actions, and the quotes from Andrew Ritchie. The summary only includes the bare minimum of information needed to convey the basic idea of the article, but it does not provide the same level of detail and context as the article.
