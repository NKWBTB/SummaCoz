    Article: 
    tom o'carroll , a leading member of the notorious paedophile information exchange ( above ) , has joined the supporters of the media pressure group hacked off
a leading member of the notorious paedophile information exchange , which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s , has joined the supporters of the media pressure group hacked off .
tom o'carroll , a former open university information officer and formerly a key activist for pie , attended a hacked off rally in the houses of parliament on february 25 to lobby mps for state involvement in media regulation .
the organisation , set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal , is campaigning against what it sees as the ` biased and unfair ' independent press standards organisation .
it wants mps to set up a statutory body to regulate the press , as recommended by the leveson inquiry .
the news that o'carroll is a backer of hacked off will be an embarrassment to the group .
pie was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the national council for civil liberties ( nccl ) .
the nccl lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child ` understood the nature of the act ' and apparently consented .
the group also wanted incest to be legalised .
o'carroll was on the nccl 's gay rights sub-committee .
the 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ` corrupting public morals ' .
he wrote a blog after the february meeting , chaired by comedian john cleese , confirming his attendance .
a hacked off spokesman said that the meeting was ` open to and free for all members of the public to attend ' .
o'carroll attended a hacked off rally in the houses of parliament on february 25 to lobby mps for state involvement in media regulation , which john cleese ( left ; right in fawlty towers ) chaired 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Based on the given article, the summary provided is not consistent with the article because:

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll joined Hacked Off to campaign for state involvement in media regulation, but the article states that he attended a Hacked Off rally to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation. This suggests that O'Carroll is not a member of Hacked Off, but rather attended the rally as an individual.
2. The summary does not mention O'Carroll's background as a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) and his conviction for "corrupting public morals" in 1981. The article reveals that O'Carroll has a history of advocating for the legalization of child sex and incest, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary states that Hacked Off wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press, but the article states that Hacked Off wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press as recommended by the Leveson Inquiry. This suggests that the summary omits the Leveson Inquiry's role in Hacked Off's campaign for media regulation.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it fails to mention O'Carroll's background and motivations, and omits the Leveson Inquiry's role in Hacked Off's campaign for media regulation.
