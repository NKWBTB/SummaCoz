     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the video shows a small boy displaying dazzling basketball skills, while the article only mentions that the video shows the boy scoring a succession of hoops and dribbling two basketballs. The summary exaggerates the boy's skills.
2. The summary claims that the boy is five years old, while the article only mentions his age as "five-year-old."
3. The summary states that the boy has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, while the article does not mention this information.
4. The summary uses more sensational language than the article, such as "dazzling array of basketball skills" and "incredible skills." The article uses more straightforward language, such as "skilful" and "talented."
5. The summary includes comments from netizens in China, while the article does not mention any comments from netizens.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the boy's skills, includes additional information not present in the article, and uses more sensational language.
