Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the child, Mai Zizhuo, has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old. However, the article states that he started playing basketball at the age of five.
2. The summary does not mention the viral video that is making the rounds in China, which is a key aspect of the article.
3. The summary does not mention the incredible skills of Mai Zizhuo, which are highlighted in the article as the reason for his fame and the subject of the viral video.
4. The summary does not mention the reactions of netizens in China, who are stunned by Mai Zizhuo's potential and have left comments by the thousands.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include key information about Mai Zizhuo's age, the viral video, and the reactions of netizens in China.
