Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Inconsistent size: The summary mentions a 5.68 m juvenile female Omura's whale, while the article states that the carcass was 5.38 m long.
2. Incorrect distribution: The summary states that Omura's whales are usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. However, the article states that the species is found in tropical and subtropical waters, and the carcass was found on a remote beach in Western Australia.
3. Incorrect number of vertebrae: The summary mentions that Omura's whales have 67 vertebrae, while the article states that they have 53 vertebrae.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Inconsistent size: The summary mentions a 5.68 m juvenile female Omura's whale, while the article states that the carcass was 5.38 m long. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may not be accurately representing the information in the article.
2. Incorrect distribution: The summary states that Omura's whales are usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. However, the article states that the species is found in tropical and subtropical waters, and the carcass was found on a remote beach in Western Australia. This suggests that the summary may not be accurately representing the information in the article.
3. Incorrect number of vertebrae: The summary mentions that Omura's whales have 67 vertebrae, while the article states that they have 53 vertebrae. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may not be accurately representing the information in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the size, distribution, and number of vertebrae of Omura's whales.
