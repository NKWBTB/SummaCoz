    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia. However, the article states that the whale was discovered on a remote beach in the North West Cape of Western Australia. The location in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary states that the whale was identified as an Omura's whale with DNA profiling. The article also states that the whale was identified as an Omura's whale using DNA profiling. However, the summary does not provide any information about the difficulty of identifying the species, whereas the article states that identifying the species was initially difficult for Department of Parks and Wildlife staff.
3. The summary states that the species is usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. The article also states that the species is usually found in these areas. However, the summary does not provide any information about the rarity of the species or the significance of the find, whereas the article states that the find is highly significant for whale scientists because very little is known about the species.
4. The summary states that the carcass has been buried and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and possibly for public display in museums. The article does not mention anything about the carcass being buried or the skeleton being recovered.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it appears that the summary is not a consistent representation of the article.
