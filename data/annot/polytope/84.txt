</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, which is not supported by the article. The article states that the cheapest tickets were £64 for the 12:45 pm kick-off, but does not mention the price for the lunchtime kick-off.
2. The summary does not mention the protest against ticket prices, which is a key aspect of the article. The article highlights the protest as the reason for the empty seats, while the summary does not mention it at all.
3. The summary does not mention the banners held up inside and outside the ground, which is another key aspect of the article. The article highlights the banners as a way for fans to express their discontent with the rising costs of modern football, while the summary does not mention them.
4. The summary does not mention the organizers of the protest, such as Kelvin Meadows and Roy Bentham, who are quoted in the article. Their quotes are not included in the summary.
5. The summary does not mention the further protests expected after full-time at the Emirates, which is mentioned at the end of the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide an accurate representation of the article. It does not include key details such as the protest against ticket prices, the banners held up, the organizers of the protest, and the further protests expected after full-time. These omissions make the summary inconsistent with the article.
