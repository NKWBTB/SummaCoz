    Article: 
    ( cnn ) with help from some filmmakers , 102-year-old alice barker went back in time .
barker was a dancer in such new york nightspots as the cotton club and the cafe zanzibar in the 1930s and 1940s , part of chorus lines that entertained alongside notables including bill " bojangles " robinson and frank sinatra .
there were motion pictures made of barker , but she had never seen any of them .
moreover , her photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years .
so she had never seen herself actually dancing -- until now .
mark cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of " soundies " -- early music videos -- and showed them to barker at the nursing home where she lives .
the ageless dancer was delighted .
" it 's just fabulous , " she said . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alice Barker had never seen herself dancing until now, but the article states that there were motion pictures made of her dancing in the 1930s and 1940s. This implies that she had seen herself dancing before, which contradicts the summary.
2. The summary also states that Alice Barker had never seen any of her photographs or memorabilia, but the article states that there were motion pictures made of her and that Mark Cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of "soundies" (early music videos) that featured her dancing. This suggests that she had seen some of her own memorabilia before, which again contradicts the summary.
3. Therefore, based on these contradictions, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article.
