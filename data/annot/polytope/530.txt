Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Alice Barker was a dancer in the 1930s and 1940s, but she had never seen any of her own performances on film.
2. The summary states that Alice Barker had never seen herself dancing until now.
3. The article does not mention anything about Alice Barker seeing her own performances on film for the first time.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Alice Barker had never seen herself dancing until now is not consistent with the article.

The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary omits the fact that Alice Barker had seen her own performances on film before, as mentioned in the article. The summary only mentions that she had never seen herself dancing until now, which is not accurate according to the article.
