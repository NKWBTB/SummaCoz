    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Chelsea would loan Muto to partner club Vitesse Arnhem next season, but the article does not mention anything about a loan.
2. The summary quotes Muto as saying he wants to join a club where he will "play and develop," but the article quotes him as saying he wants to take his time and think about it carefully before making a decision.
3. The summary implies that Chelsea has made an offer for Muto, but the article does not confirm this. The article only mentions that Chelsea is interested in Muto and that the club's manager, Jose Mourinho, is aware of the Japanese international.
4. The summary states that Muto is considering a move to Chelsea because he wants to join a club where he will play regularly and realize his potential, but the article does not mention this as a reason for his potential move to Chelsea.
5. The summary quotes Real Zaragoza boss Ranko Popovic as saying that Muto has the potential to be a big hit at Stamford Bridge, but the article does not include this quote.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as the loan to Vitesse Arnhem, and it omits other important information, such as the fact that Chelsea has not confirmed an offer for Muto. Additionally, the summary quotes Muto as saying things that he did not actually say in the article.
