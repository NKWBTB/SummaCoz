    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the drugs are worth $105 million, while the article states that the drugs are worth "more than $105 million". This discrepancy suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary states that the seizure was carried out by French authorities, which is correct. However, the article states that the seizure was carried out by French customs officers, which is a specific subset of French authorities. This difference in wording suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. The summary states that the sailboat was flying an American flag, which is not mentioned in the article. This omission suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The summary states that one Venezuelan and two Spanish citizens were arrested, which is correct. However, the article only mentions that one Venezuelan citizen was arrested, and does not mention the nationality of the other two individuals. This difference in wording suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. Specifically, the summary overestimates the value of the drugs, misstates the entity that carried out the seizure, and fails to mention the nationality of two of the individuals arrested.
