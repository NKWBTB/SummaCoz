Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the French customs officers seized "more than 2 tons of cocaine" aboard a sailboat, while the summary states that the seizure was "more than 2 tons."

Reasoning: The article provides a specific quantity of cocaine seized (2 tons), while the summary only provides a range (more than 2 tons).

2. The article estimates the value of the seized drugs to be "more than $105 million," while the summary states that the value is "estimated at $105 million."

Reasoning: The article provides a more precise estimate of the value, using the phrase "more than," while the summary uses the phrase "estimated at," which implies a less precise estimate.

3. The article mentions that this is the "biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities," while the summary does not include this information.

Reasoning: The article provides additional information that is not included in the summary, which makes the summary inconsistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the specific quantity of cocaine seized, the estimated value of the drugs, and the significance of the seizure.
