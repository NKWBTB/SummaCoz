    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Muliaina was arrested "last night after his team was defeated in the European Challenge Cup," while the article states that he was arrested "after his team was defeated in the quarter finals of the European Challenge Cup."

The article is more specific about the timing of the arrest, stating that it occurred after the quarter-final match, whereas the summary does not provide the same level of detail.

2. The summary states that Muliaina was arrested "in connection with an allegation in Cardiff in March," while the article states that he was arrested "on suspicion of sexual assault in relation to an incident in Cardiff in March."

The summary does not include the word "suspicion" or "allegation," which are both present in the article. This suggests that the summary may be overstating the severity of the situation or implying that Muliaina has been charged with a crime, which is not the case according to the article.

3. The summary states that Muliaina "denies the allegations," while the article states that he "totally denies all the allegations."

The summary's wording suggests that Muliaina is admitting to the allegations, but is denying them. The article's wording, on the other hand, makes it clear that Muliaina is categorically denying any wrongdoing.

4. The summary states that Muliaina was "led away by officers at the Kingsholm stadium last night," while the article states that he was "handed over to officers from South Wales Police who are investigating the incident."

The summary implies that Muliaina was arrested at the stadium and taken away by officers, whereas the article suggests that he was handed over to other officers for further investigation.

5. The summary does not include any information about Muliaina's bail or his solicitor's statement, which are both present in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions, and it may be overstating the severity of the situation.
