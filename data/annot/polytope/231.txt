</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the two men allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka on Rottnest Island.
2. However, the article states that the two men tried to set the quokka alight, not that they actually did so. The article uses the phrase "the two men allegedly tried to set the quokka alight" instead of "the two men allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter".
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the men successfully set the quokka on fire, whereas the article suggests that they only tried to do so.
4. Additionally, the summary does not mention the fact that the quokka was singed by the flame, which is mentioned in the article.
5. Finally, the summary states that the men will appear in Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 17, but the article states that they were evicted from the island and charged with animal cruelty, without mentioning a court appearance date.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the events described in the article. The summary implies that the men successfully set the quokka on fire, while the article suggests that they only tried to do so, and it does not mention the quokka being singed. Additionally, the summary does not provide all the information included in the article, such as the fact that the quokka survived the incident and the men were charged with animal cruelty.
