    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the two men allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka on Rottnest Island. However, the article does not mention anything about an aerosol spray or a lighter.
2. The summary states that the quokka was the innocent victim of a cruel act by two French tourists who tried to set the Australian animal alight. However, the article does not use the word "cruel" or "alight" to describe the incident. Instead, it describes the incident as "reckless" and states that the quokka was "singed" by the flame.
3. The summary states that the two men were evicted from the island and charged with animal cruelty. However, the article does not mention anything about the men being evicted from the island or charged with animal cruelty. Instead, it states that they have each been charged with animal cruelty and will appear in Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 17.
4. The summary states that the quokka was found on Rottnest Island off Perth in Western Australia. However, the article does not mention the location of the quokka, only stating that it was found on a small island off the west coast of Australia.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains details that are not present in the article, and omits other details that are present in the article.
