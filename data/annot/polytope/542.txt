Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova saved a match point to beat Sabine Lisicki in the second set, but the summary does not mention anything about a match point being saved.
2. The article reports that Pavlyuchenkova won the second set 7-6 (4), but the summary only states that she won the set 6-3.
3. The article states that Lisicki made 63 unforced errors, but this information is not included in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the match. The article provides more specific information about the match, such as the score in the second set and the number of unforced errors made by Lisicki, which are not included in the summary.
