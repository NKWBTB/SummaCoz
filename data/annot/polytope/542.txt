    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova saved a match point to beat Sabine Lisicki, but the article does not mention any match point being saved.
2. The summary states that Pavlyuchenkova beat Lisicki 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3, but the article states that Pavlyuchenkova beat Lisicki 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3, after Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Julia Goerges in straight sets in the opening rubber.
3. The summary does not mention Svetlana Kuznetsova's victory in the opening rubber.
4. The article states that both players had problems on their serve, with Pavlyuchenkova racking up 13 double faults and Lisicki committing 63 unforced errors. The summary does not mention this.
5. The article quotes Pavlyuchenkova as saying that Lisicki's power caused her problems, but the summary does not include this quote.
6. The article states that Russia needs one win from Sunday's three matches to reach the final and bag a first Fed Cup title since 2008, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the match and omits important information.
