during his murder trial , he testified that he had not killed his wife , but a new hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days .
after the verdict was handed down last month , robarge 's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief .
according to police , kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on june 27 , 2013 -- the day she disappeared from her charlestown , new hampshire , home and her body was later found .
the jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed ` extreme indifference to the value of human life . '

and james robarge 's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it .
however , most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence .
the closest thing to an eyewitness was a unity man who said he saw robarge , wearing latex gloves , crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in unity the night kelly disappeared .
her body was found off a logging road not far from there , and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched robarge 's shattered oil pan .
due to the condition of her body , a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of ` homicidal violence . '

meanwhile , one of the last people to see kelly alive the day she disappeared was frances uptegrove , a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years .
uptegrove testified that kelly robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce .
he said : ` she seemed clear-headed , determined .
she 'd made up her mind . '
in testimony spanning two days , robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced .
robarge claimed that he did n't know his wife had filed for divorce , but he acknowledged that just days before , he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one .

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Sentence length: The summary states that James Robarge was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison, while the article states that he was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 28 years.
2. Parole eligibility: The summary states that Robarge could be eligible for parole in 28 years, while the article states that he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years.
3. Cause of death: The summary states that the medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached, while the article states that the cause of death was determined to be homicidal violence.
4. Evidence: The summary states that most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence, while the article states that the jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed extreme indifference to the value of human life.
5. Emotional response: The summary states that Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife, while the article states that he was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 30 years to life in prison, and that his daughters were in court sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It omits or misstates several key details, such as the length of Robarge's sentence, his parole eligibility, the cause of death, and the evidence presented in the case. Additionally, the summary does not convey the emotional impact of the article, which includes the devastating impact of the murder on Robarge's daughters and the family's grief and shock.
