Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "researchers claim" that children who share ipads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who do not.
2. However, the summary does not include the phrase "researchers claim." Instead, it simply states that "research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices."
3. The article provides specific data and statistics to support the claim that shared iPad use leads to better literacy outcomes. For example, the article states that kindergarten children who shared ipads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no ipads or in which each student had their own device.
4. The summary does not include any of these specific data or statistics. Instead, it simply states that "research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices."
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the specific data and statistics that support the claim that shared iPad use leads to better literacy outcomes. Instead, it simply states a general conclusion without providing any specific evidence to support it.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the specific data and statistics that support the claim that shared iPad use leads to better literacy outcomes. Instead, it simply states a general conclusion without providing any specific evidence to support it.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states "children who share ipads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who do n't , researchers claim".
2. The article states "Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who donâ€™t, researchers claim".
3. The inconsistency is the spelling of "don't" where the summary wrote "do n't" which can be confusing to the reader.
