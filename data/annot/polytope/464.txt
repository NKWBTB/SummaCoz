Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "12 per cent of people questioned thought the child should be named after William's mother - Diana the Princess of Wales." However, the article states that 12 per cent of people think the child should be named Diana if it is a girl, not that they think the child should be named after William's mother.
2. The summary states that Brits are hoping for a baby princess this time and favor the name Diana. However, the article states that while Diana is the favorite name for a girl, Brits are also hoping for a baby princess and favor the names Alice and Charlotte.
3. The summary does not mention the other names that were preferred by Brits, such as Alice and Charlotte.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the information provided in the article. It focuses solely on the name Diana and does not mention the other names that were preferred by Brits, which is not in line with the article's focus on the preferences of the British public.
