     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that 12% of people think the child should be named after William's mother, Diana, while the article states that 13% of people prefer the name James for a boy and only 12% prefer the name Diana for a girl.
2. The summary mentions that Alice and Charlotte are the next preferred names for a girl, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that if the child is a boy, 13% of people prefer the name James, and if it's a girl, 12% prefer the name Diana.
3. The summary states that Brits are hoping for a baby princess this time, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that a quarter of the people polled want the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to have a female baby, while only 3% hope for a younger brother for George.
4. The summary mentions that the choices were echoed on social media, but the article does not provide any examples or quotes from social media users.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it omits certain details and includes others that are not present in the article.
