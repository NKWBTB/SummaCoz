    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the pool was drained to create a unique catwalk for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, but the article does not mention anything about the pool being drained. Instead, it states that the pool was empty due to lap swimmers being forced to take their exercise back to the beach.
2. The summary mentions that the empty pool was used as a catwalk setting for the fashion show, but the article states that the models paraded through the empty pool and along the break wall.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the models wearing unisex clothing, but the article states that the collection was a presentation of entirely monochrome creations and that the designs were androgynous and suitable for day to night wear.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the location of the fashion show being the iconic Icebergs club, but the article states that the show took place at the Icebergs club in Bondi.
5. The summary does not mention anything about the beautiful blue sky and sunshine throughout the show, but the article states that the show took place on an unseasonably warm 28 degrees Celsius day.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. It does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
