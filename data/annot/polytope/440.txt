    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify the reasons why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the key points in the summary

* Chelsea is poised to link up with Belgian club Royal Mouscron-Peruwelz.
* The Belgian club has been in the top flight for a season since promotion.
* Chelsea has been in early discussions over a possible partnership with the club.

Step 2: Identify the key points in the article

* Chelsea is in early discussions over a possible partnership with Belgian club Royal Mouscron-Peruwelz.
* Mouscron had a partnership with Lille but that is now set to end, leaving room for a new deal with Chelsea.
* Mouscron are currently 21st in Belgium's Pro League.
* Chelsea already has an agreement with Vitesse Arnhem in Holland and has been looking at other link-ups across Europe to help develop their squad.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies

* The summary states that Chelsea is poised to link up with Mouscron, while the article states that Chelsea is in early discussions over a possible partnership.
* The summary does not mention that Mouscron had a partnership with Lille that is now set to end, which is a key point in the article.
* The summary does not mention that Mouscron is currently 21st in the Pro League, which is a key point in the article.

Step 4: Explain the reasons for the inconsistencies

* The summary may have been written based on earlier discussions or negotiations between Chelsea and Mouscron, before the partnership with Lille ended.
* The summary may have focused on the potential partnership between Chelsea and Mouscron, without including all the details about Mouscron's current situation in the Pro League.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the key points about Mouscron's current situation and the early discussions between Chelsea and Mouscron.
