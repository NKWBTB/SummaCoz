Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Chelsea are "poised to link up" with Belgian club Royal Mouscron-Peruwelz, which implies a formal partnership or agreement is being discussed or planned. However, the article does not mention any such agreement or partnership.
2. The summary mentions that Mouscron has been in the top flight for a season since promotion, which is not accurate. According to the article, Mouscron has been in the top flight for one season since winning promotion via the play-offs last summer.
3. The summary states that Nemaja Matic is one of three players on loan at Vitesse Arnhem from Chelsea this season, which is correct. However, the article does not mention anything about Matic being on loan at Vitesse.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article only mentions early discussions about a possible partnership between Chelsea and Mouscron, without any mention of a formal agreement or partnership. Additionally, the summary incorrectly states that Mouscron has been in the top flight for a season, when in fact they have only been in the top flight for one season since promotion. Finally, the summary mentions Matic being on loan at Vitesse, which is not mentioned in the article.
