her badly decomposed body , with her hands and head detached , was found 10 days later in unity .

robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years , according to valley news .
in the statement read by his lawyer on friday , he told his daughters , ` i love you guys more than life itself ' and called their mother ` the love of my life . '
one of the couple 's daughters , ciera robarge , said in court that she loved and missed her mom .
` i love and miss my mom more and more every day , ' she said .

kelly 's brother , ron prouty jr. , faced robarge on friday and told him , ` i hope you rot in hell . '
kelly 's brother , ron prouty jr , told robarge ( above ) he hoped he ` rotted in hell ' during the sentencing on friday
during his murder trial , he testified that he had not killed his wife , but a new hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days .
after the verdict was handed down last month , robarge 's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief .
according to police , kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on june 27 , 2013 -- the day she disappeared from her charlestown , new hampshire , home and her body was later found .
the jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed ` extreme indifference to the value of human life . '
prosecutors said the entryway to kelly robarge 's home contained ` countless ' spatters of blood .

and james robarge 's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it .
however , most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence .
the closest thing to an eyewitness was a unity man who said he saw robarge , wearing latex gloves , crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in unity the night kelly disappeared .
her body was found off a logging road not far from there , and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched robarge 's shattered oil pan .
due to the condition of her body , a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of ` homicidal violence . '

meanwhile , one of the last people to see kelly alive the day she disappeared was frances uptegrove , a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years .
uptegrove testified that kelly robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce .
he said : ` she seemed clear-headed , determined .
she 'd made up her mind . '
in testimony spanning two days , robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced .
robarge claimed that he did n't know his wife had filed for divorce , but he acknowledged that just days before , he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one .

     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that James Robarge was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison, while the article states that he was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 28 years.
2. The summary states that James Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars, while the article states that he has served nearly two years behind bars, which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the jury rejected a first-degree murder charge and found James Robarge guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed "extreme indifference to the value of human life."
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained "countless" spatters of blood, which was one of the key pieces of evidence used to convict James Robarge.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where his wife's body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it, which was also used as evidence against him.
6. The summary does not mention the fact that the closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who saw James Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly disappeared.
7. The summary does not mention the fact that her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched James Robarge's shattered oil pan.
8. The summary does not mention the fact that due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached, but concluded she died as the result of "homicidal violence."

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article, as it omits many key details and does not convey the full scope of the evidence used to convict James Robarge.
