</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo thinks that his former teammates Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti should move to Boca.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Pirlo or Totti moving to Boca.
3. The article only mentions that Osvaldo has urged the two players to join him at Boca, but there is no indication that they are considering such a move.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Pirlo and Totti are likely to move to Boca, when in fact, there is no such indication in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it adds a new piece of information (that Pirlo and Totti are likely to move to Boca) that is not present in the article.
