    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's the step-by-step explanation of why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo thinks Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti should move to Boca, but the article does not mention anything about Pirlo or Totti moving to Boca.

2. The summary mentions that Osvaldo believes Pirlo and Totti would be a good fit for Boca, but the article does not quote Osvaldo as saying this.

3. The summary states that Osvaldo thinks the fans would love to have Pirlo and Totti line up on the pitch, but the article does not mention anything about the fans' reactions.

4. The summary mentions that Osvaldo has played with many great players over the years and considers Pirlo and Totti among his friends, but the article does not provide this context.

5. The summary states that Pirlo has established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football and is hugely popular, but this information is not relevant to the main point of the article, which is about Osvaldo's desire for Pirlo and Totti to join him at Boca.

6. The article does not mention anything about Osvaldo urging Pirlo and Totti to move continents and join him at Boca, as stated in the summary.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
