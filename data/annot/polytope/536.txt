    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francisco Totti to join him at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors. However, the article does not mention anything about Osvaldo urging them to join him. Instead, the article quotes Osvaldo as saying that he would like to have Pirlo and Totti join him at Boca.
2. The summary mentions that Osvaldo moved to his current side on a loan deal from Southampton, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that Osvaldo moved to Boca on a loan deal.
3. The summary states that Osvaldo has become an instant hit at Boca, scoring three goals in six games. The article does not mention the number of goals Osvaldo has scored, only stating that he has become an instant hit.
4. The summary quotes Osvaldo as saying that the fans would love to have Pirlo and Totti line up on the La Bombonera pitch. The article does not mention this quote from Osvaldo.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and leaves out information that is present in the article.
