     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova beat Sabine Lisicki 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3, but the article states that Pavlyuchenkova saved a match point to beat Lisicki 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3.
2. The summary does not mention that Pavlyuchenkova saved a match point in the second set, which is a crucial detail that is mentioned in the article.
3. The summary states that Lisicki had 63 unforced errors, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary does not mention that Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Julia Goerges in straight sets, which is mentioned in the article.
5. The summary does not mention that Russia needs one win from Sunday's three matches to reach the final, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate account of the match, and is therefore not consistent with the article.
