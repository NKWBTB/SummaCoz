</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), a carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. However, the article does not mention PX as one of the chemicals produced by the plant. Instead, it mentions that the plant produces oil, which leaked and caused the explosion.
2. The summary states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. However, the article does not mention any injuries or casualties.
3. The summary states that the plant is located in zhangzhou city, but the article does not provide the location of the plant.
4. The summary states that the explosion sparked a huge fire, but the article only mentions a fire that was put out by more than 600 firefighters.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that the plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, or that the construction of PX plants has sparked protests in the past.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. Specifically, it incorrectly states that the plant produces PX, fails to mention the oil leak that caused the explosion, and does not mention any injuries or casualties. Additionally, it provides incomplete information about the location of the plant and the extent of the fire.
