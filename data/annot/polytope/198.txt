    Article: 
    fears for two new strains of influenza , which caused a spike in deaths in europe and the united states , will see the arrival of an improved vaccination on australian shores .
stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against influenza a strain h3n2 and influenza b strain b/phuket .
the decision to include both was triggered by a spike in flu-related deaths in the northern hemisphere as the vaccine was not a good match to fight against the two types of flu .
stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against two new strains
high-risk groups - such as the very young and very old , and most indigenous australians - will be able to access free , government-funded flu shots from april 20 .
experts say the modified version of the vaccination is worth waiting for .
but dr alan hampson , who chairs the influenza specialist group , said everyone should be getting the vaccine , which also provided protection against influenza a strain h1n1 .
he said h3n2 and b/phuket caused a spike in deaths in europe and the us during the northern winter because the vaccine available did not provide the right buffer against the diseases .
there was a spike in deaths related to h3n2 and b/phuket in europe and the us during the northern winter as the vaccine did not cover the strains
world health authorities realised that and modified the vaccine to be used in australia this winter .
` our vaccine now should be a really good match for the strains that are circulating globally and we certainly hope we can prevent more deaths per capita than they did , ' dr hampson told aap .
` in fact the vaccine that will be used in the next northern winter will be exactly the same as the one we 'll be using over the next few weeks . '
dr hampson said people should be booking their flu shots now , given the delay in stocks arriving .
` even if people are not in one of the high-risk groups , they are probably coming into contact with people in their own families who are , ' he said .
` those high-risk groups are harder to protect so it 's great if we can also protect the people around them . ' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the vaccine is being modified to include protection against two new strains, H3N2 and B/Phuket, but the article does not mention anything about new strains. Instead, it talks about the vaccine being modified to provide better protection against the existing strains that are circulating globally.
2. The summary states that the vaccine is being modified because of a spike in flu-related deaths in the northern hemisphere, but the article does not mention anything about deaths. Instead, it talks about the vaccine being modified to provide better protection against the existing strains.
3. The summary states that the modified vaccine will be available in Australia this winter, but the article does not mention anything about the vaccine being available in Australia. Instead, it talks about the vaccine being modified to provide better protection against the existing strains globally.
4. The summary states that Dr. Hampson said everyone should be getting the vaccine, but the article does not mention anything about Dr. Hampson saying this. Instead, it quotes Dr. Hampson as saying that the modified vaccine is worth waiting for and that high-risk groups should be able to access free, government-funded flu shots from April 20.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and it omits information that is present in the article.
