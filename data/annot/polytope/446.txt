Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the couple was not alerted of the photos until many months after the celebration, while the article states that the bride's sister told the family about the racist incident at the photo booth after the wedding.
2. The summary does not mention that the couple rented the photo booth for the party, while the article states that the couple rented the photo booth for the party.
3. The summary does not mention that the groom claims Evans did not even apologize, while the article states that Evans allegedly told the couple to " Sue me."
4. The summary does not mention that Evans denied all allegations and claimed that at a party of 103 people, there is no evidence linking the company to the offensive caption, while the article states that Evans made these claims.
5. The summary does not mention that the couple wants an apology at the very least, while the article states that the couple's lawyer said that the couple wants an apology from James Evans of Premiere Photos.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the article's content. It omits several important details and includes some inaccuracies, such as the timing of when the couple was alerted of the photos and Evans' alleged response to the couple.
