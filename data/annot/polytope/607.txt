     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the university decided to proceed with the screening of "American Sniper," while the article states that the university initially decided to cancel the screening due to objections from some students.
2. The summary does not mention any objections from students or any controversy surrounding the film, while the article highlights the backlash to the decision to cancel the movie and the counter-petition that was signed by some students.
3. The summary does not mention the specific reason for the university's initial decision to cancel the screening (i.e., the film's depiction of the Iraq war and its potential impact on the Middle East and Arab-American community), while the article highlights this reason as the basis for the objections from some students.
4. The summary mentions that the university will screen the family-friendly "Paddington" as an alternative, while the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it omits key details and presents a different narrative.
