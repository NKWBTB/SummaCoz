    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "three-quarters of women never wash their own car." However, the article does not support this statement. According to the article, 31% of men have never washed their own car, and there is no mention of women's car washing habits.
2. The summary also states that "drivers are more likely to take it to a car wash on a local forecourt." This is not entirely accurate, as the article states that three-quarters of drivers never wash their own car, but it does not specify where they take their cars to be washed.
3. The summary mentions that only 5% of those surveyed said they had ever asked their children to wash the car as a way for them to earn extra pocket money. However, the article does not mention this statistic.
4. The summary does not mention the factor of the rise of hand car washes, which is mentioned in the article as one of the reasons for the decline of drivers washing their own cars.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. It appears to be a summary of a different article or a misinterpretation of the information provided in the article.
