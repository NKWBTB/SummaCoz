Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Inconsistent information: The summary states that Floyd Mayweather has been dating UNK Medina since last year, but the article does not mention anything about Mayweather's personal life or dating history.
2. Lack of achievements: The summary only mentions Mayweather's upcoming fight against Pacquiao, but the article provides a detailed list of Mayweather's achievements in and out of the ring, including his impressive boxing record, business ventures, and endorsement deals.
3. No mention of Pacquiao: The summary only focuses on Mayweather, while the article provides information about both fighters, including Pacquiao's achievements, personal life, and political ambitions.
4. Incorrect grammar and punctuation: The summary contains grammatical errors and incorrect punctuation, such as the repetition of "dating UNK Medina" and the lack of a period at the end of the first sentence.
