only a week ago , sterling held nothing back with his stunning interview after rejecting a new £ 100,000-a-week deal at liverpool .
he also sensationally revealed that he was flattered to be linked with arsenal to cast a huge question mark over his future .
but liverpool are adamant that the 20-year-old , who has two years left to run on his contract , will not be quitting this summer and are putting their shirt on him to stay .
one fan shouted ` make sure we see you in that next season ' at sterling , and the heckle was greeted with applause .
sterling told an expectant audience : ` the fans are great .
it 's a massive boost when you come out of the changing room and hear them sing that song .
you ca n't get better than that .
while players also turned their attention to the fa cup semi-final against aston villa at wembley next weekend .
` it 's special to play at wembley , especially because it 's my home town , ' sterling said .
and sturridge added : ` winning the fa cup would be huge for everyone - players , fans and staff .
we all want to have some success and we hope it 's this season .
winning the cup could be a platform for more success in the future .
` it 's great to play in front of these fans .
it 's an unbelievable feeling .
it 's a cliche but it 's true , they are our 12th man .

they mean a lot to us . '

although departing captain steven gerrard wo n't be around to model liverpool 's new kit next season , his dream of bowing out in the fa cup final on his birthday , may 31 , remains alive .

3. The summary also mentions that the new kit design is the first offering from New Balance, who struck a record-breaking £300million four-year kit deal to replace sister company Warrior as Liverpool's suppliers.
4. However, the article does not mention any such deal or any information about New Balance replacing Warrior as Liverpool's suppliers.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions expectations from Liverpool supporters and a record-breaking kit deal with New Balance, neither of which is mentioned in the article.
