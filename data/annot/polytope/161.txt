    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Todd Phillips was injured when he was struck by the car of Francesco Dracone during the inaugural IndyCar Grand Prix of Louisiana on Sunday.

2. However, the article does not mention that Todd Phillips was struck by the car of Francesco Dracone. Instead, it states that Phillips was hit by the car driven by Dracone while he was exiting his pit box.

3. The summary also states that Dracone had come in on lap 25 for tires and fuel, but the article does not mention this detail.

4. The article states that Dracone spun out while exiting his pit box, clipping Phillips' leg, but the summary does not mention this detail.

5. The summary states that Phillips was taken to the infield care center for treatment and received stitches for a cut on his leg, but the article does not mention this detail.

6. The article states that many cars struggled with traction during the race after rain had fallen for hours leading up to the green flag, but the summary does not mention this detail.

7. The summary states that Dracone did not finish the race and wound up 23rd, but the article does not mention this detail.

8. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
