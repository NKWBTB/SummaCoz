Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Todd Phillips was injured when he was struck by the car of Francesco Dracone.
2. However, the article states that Dracone spun while exiting his pit box, clipping Phillips' leg.
3. The summary does not mention that Dracone spun out or clipped Phillips' leg, only that he struck Phillips' leg.
4. The article also mentions that many cars struggled with traction during the race due to rain, but the summary does not include this information.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the events leading to Phillips' injury and omits important information about the race conditions.
