    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that a third of men have never picked up a bucket or UNK leather to clean their own motor, which is inconsistent with the article's statement that a third of men have never washed their own car.

Step 2: The article states that 31% of men have never washed their own car, while the summary states that a third of men have never picked up a bucket or UNK leather. This discrepancy indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Step 3: The article explains that the decline of drivers washing their own cars is due to various factors such as the rise of hand car washes, the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean, and the fact that people no longer have as much time. The summary does not mention any of these factors.

Step 4: The article mentions that Brits are more likely to wash their own cars during holidays, but the summary does not mention this.

Step 5: The article provides specific information about the cities where cars are most likely to be washed by their owners and the types of cars that are most likely to be washed. The summary does not provide this information.

Conclusion: The given summary is not consistent with the article because it misstates the information and fails to provide the same level of detail as the article.
