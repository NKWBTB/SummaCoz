Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the father (UNK) filmed his son chasing the family feline around the garden, which is not consistent with the article. The article states that the father, Lionel Hutz, filmed his young son chasing the family feline.
2. The summary incorrectly states that the cat immediately gets up and UNK over to another spot. The article states that the cat licks its fur before the boy comes along and plonks himself on top, and then the cat scurries away.
3. The summary repeats the mistake from step 2, stating that the cat immediately gets up and UNK over to another spot again. This is not supported by the article.
4. The summary does not mention the boy's attempt to follow the cat to its new location, which is a significant detail in the article.
5. The summary does not mention the later video showing the duo swiftly made up, and the boy gently feeding the cat handfuls of treats, which is also a significant detail in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains several errors.
