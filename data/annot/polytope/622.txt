    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the boy chased the family feline around the garden to get some rest, but the article does not mention anything about the boy chasing the cat. Instead, the article states that the boy used the cat as a pillow.
2. The summary mentions that the cat immediately gets up and scurries over to another spot after being sat on, but the article states that the cat sat licking its fur before the boy plonked himself on top.
3. The summary does not mention the cat's reaction to being used as a pillow, but the article states that the cat seemed not amused and scurried away.
4. The summary mentions the boy repeating the same move and rolling to the ground, but the article does not mention this.
5. The article shows the duo making up later and the boy gently feeding the cat handfuls of treats, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the events described in the article and leaves out important details.
