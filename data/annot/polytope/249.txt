    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistency
The inconsistency is in the second sentence of the summary, which states that Amir Khan enjoyed a family trip to a safari park in northern California, but the article does not mention a safari park or a family trip.

Step 2: Analyze the article
Let's analyze the article to find out if there is any information that could support the inconsistency.

The article mentions that Amir Khan visited Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, an adventure park in California, where he posed with a giraffe, fed a rare white tiger, and also enjoyed time with his wife and daughter.

Step 3: Analyze the summary
Now, let's analyze the summary again, but this time, we'll look for any information that could support the inconsistency.

The summary mentions that Amir Khan spent his Friday alongside some fellow natural-born fighters, but it does not mention anything about a safari park or a family trip.

Step 4: Identify the reason for the inconsistency
Based on our analysis, we can identify the reason for the inconsistency. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a safari park, which is not present in the article.

Step 5: Provide an explanation
Therefore, we can explain that the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a safari park, which is not present in the article. The article only mentions Amir Khan's visit to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, an adventure park in California, where he posed with animals and enjoyed time with his family.
