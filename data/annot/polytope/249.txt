Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The first sentence of the summary is "bolton-born boxer Amir Khan spent his Friday alongside some fellow natural-born fighters as he enjoyed a family trip to a safari park in northern California."
2. This sentence is not present in the article. The article only mentions a family trip to a safari park, but it does not mention any other fighters being present.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces the idea of other fighters being present, which is not supported by the article.
4. The second sentence of the summary is "bolton-born boxer Amir Khan enjoyed a day at the safari park with his family in northern California."
5. This sentence is partially consistent with the article, as the article does mention Khan and his family enjoying a day at the safari park.
6. However, the summary adds the detail that it was a "day at the safari park," which is not present in the article. The article only mentions a "family trip" to the safari park.
7. Therefore, the second sentence of the summary is partially consistent with the article, but it also introduces new information that is not present in the article.
8. The third sentence of the summary is "Khan (left) has announced his next fight will be against Chris Algieri at welterweight on May 30."
9. This sentence is consistent with the article, as the article does mention Khan's next fight being against Chris Algieri at welterweight on May 30.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces new information that is not present in the article, such as the idea of other fighters being present at the safari park. Additionally, the summary adds details that are not present in the article, such as the phrase "day at the safari park." Only the third sentence of the summary is consistent with the article.
