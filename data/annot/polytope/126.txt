` it was just a blur , ' he said .

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the 18-year-old jockey, Lee Lewis Ferguson, was "flung from his horse" at Wincanton, but the article does not mention anything about being flung from the horse. Instead, the article states that Ferguson had a "spectacular double somersault fall" from the horse.
2. The summary states that Ferguson has just a cut on his nose to show for the fall, but the article states that he has "just a cut on the nose" and that he was "lucky" to escape with only that.
3. The summary states that Ferguson is undeterred from getting back in the saddle, but the article does not mention anything about him being undeterred. Instead, it states that he was back riding out as usual.
4. The summary states that Ferguson's fall has made him an internet sensation, but the article does not mention anything about this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the extent of Ferguson's injuries, misstates the nature of his fall, and adds information that is not present in the article (such as his supposed undeterrence and internet sensation status).
