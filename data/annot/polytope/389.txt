Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary states that "12 per cent of people questioned thought that the child should be named after William's mother - Diana the Princess of Wales." However, the article states that "a new poll has revealed that Diana is the favourite option for baby if it is a girl." The wording of the summary is incorrect as it implies that only 12% of people think the child should be named after Diana, while the article states that Diana is the favourite option for baby, not just a preferred name.
2. The summary mentions "brits are hoping for a baby princess this time and favour the name Diana." However, the article does not mention anything about "brits" or the public's preferences for a baby princess. The article only discusses the results of the YouGov survey and the possible names for the royal baby.
3. The summary states that "Alice and Charlotte were next in terms of preference, getting nine per cent of the vote each." However, the article does not mention anything about Alice or Charlotte being preferred names for the royal baby.
4. The summary mentions "if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James." However, the article does not mention anything about James being a preferred name for a boy.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. It is important to ensure that summaries accurately reflect the content of the original article to avoid confusion and misinformation.
