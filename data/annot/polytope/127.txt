    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti to join him at Boca Juniors.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Pirlo or Totti joining Boca Juniors. Instead, it mentions that Osvaldo believes they would be a good fit for the team and that the fans would love to have them play at the La Bombonera pitch.
3. The article does not provide any information about Pirlo or Totti moving to Boca Juniors or expressing any interest in joining the team.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Pirlo and Totti are joining Boca Juniors, which is not supported by the information in the article.
