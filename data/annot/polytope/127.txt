</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti to join him at Boca Juniors.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Pablo Osvaldo urging Pirlo and Totti to join him at Boca Juniors. Instead, the article states that Osvaldo believes that Pirlo and Totti would be a good fit for Boca and that the fans would love to have them line up on the La Bombonera pitch.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Osvaldo has directly urged Pirlo and Totti to join him at Boca Juniors, which is not stated in the article.
4. The article only mentions that Osvaldo believes that Pirlo and Totti would be a good fit for Boca and that the fans would love to have them play for the team.
5. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article, such as: "Pablo Osvaldo believes that Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti would be a good fit for Boca Juniors and that the fans would love to have them line up on the La Bombonera pitch."
