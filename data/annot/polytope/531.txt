    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the two men allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka on Rottnest Island.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about an aerosol spray or a lighter. Instead, it states that the two men allegedly ignited a flame with a lighter, which made contact with a quokka.
3. This discrepancy indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not provide any information about an aerosol spray, and the phrase "a large flame to make contact with a quokka" is not present in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not accurately represent the information provided in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and it omits other important details that are present in the article.
