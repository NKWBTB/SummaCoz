Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the two men allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka on Rottnest Island.
2. However, the article states that the quokka was the innocent victim of a cruel act by two French tourists who tried to set the Australian animal alight, which is not the same as igniting an aerosol spray.
3. The article also states that the quokka was singed by the flame, but the summary does not mention this detail.
4. Furthermore, the article states that the two men were evicted from the island and charged with animal cruelty, but the summary only mentions that they were evicted from the island.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey all of the information provided in the article, specifically the details about the men's actions and the quokka's injuries.
