</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that tom o'carroll attended a hacked off rally to lobby for state involvement in media regulation.
2. The article states that o'carroll joined the supporters of hacked off, a media pressure group.
3. The article also states that o'carroll was a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which campaigned to legalize child sex in the 1970s and 80s.
4. The article mentions that PIE formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) to campaign for the legalization of sex with children.
5. The article states that o'carroll was on the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee.
6. The article also mentions that o'carroll was jailed in 1981 for "corrupting public morals."

Based on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention o'carroll's involvement with PIE or his criminal history. The summary only states that o'carroll attended a hacked off rally to lobby for state involvement in media regulation, which is not the full context of his involvement with the group. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article.
