    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Based on the provided text, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally to lobby for state involvement in media regulation, but the article states that he attended the rally as a supporter of Hacked Off, not as a lobbyist.
2. The summary mentions that O'Carroll is a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), but the article does not mention this. Instead, it refers to him as a "former open university information officer and formerly a key activist for PIE".
3. The summary states that PIE campaigned for sex with children to be legalized, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the organization formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) to campaign for the age of sexual consent to be lowered to ten, and for incest to be legalized.
4. The summary does not mention O'Carroll's conviction for "corrupting public morals" in 1981, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Misrepresents O'Carroll's role in Hacked Off (he attended as a supporter, not as a lobbyist)
* Omits mention of O'Carroll's conviction for "corrupting public morals"
* Incorrectly states that PIE campaigned for sex with children to be legalized (the article states that the organization formed an alliance with NCCL to campaign for a lower age of consent, but does not mention legalization of sex with children)
* Includes information about PIE's campaigns that are not mentioned in the article (such as incest)
