    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki 7-6, 1-6, 6-3, but the article states that Williams beat Lisicki 7-6, 1-6, 6-3. The difference is in the second set, where the summary has Williams losing 1-6, but the article has her winning 7-5.
2. The summary mentions that Williams will face Simona Halep in the semi-finals, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Williams will face either Sloane Stephens or Simona Halep in the semi-finals.
3. The summary states that Williams' hopes of meeting her sister Venus were dashed by Venus' defeat to Carla Suarez Navarro, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the given summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions.
