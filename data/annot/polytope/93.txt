Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 on Wednesday. However, the article states that Williams beat Lisicki 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 on Wednesday.

Inconsistency found! The summary does not accurately reflect the article's information.

2. The summary states that Williams will face Simona Halep in the semi-finals of the Miami Open. However, the article states that Williams will face Halep for a place in the final, not in the semi-finals.

Inconsistency found! The summary does not accurately reflect the article's information.

3. The summary states that Halep beat Sloane Stephens 6-1, 7-5 to reach the semi-finals. However, the article states that Halep beat Stephens 6-1, 7-5 to reach the final, not the semi-finals.

Inconsistency found! The summary does not accurately reflect the article's information.

Therefore, based on the three inconsistencies I found, the provided summary is not consistent with the article.
