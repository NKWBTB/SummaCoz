    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the robber was masked, but the article states that he was not wearing a mask.

2. The summary mentions that the robber waved an axe, but the article does not mention an axe. Instead, it states that the robber used a baseball bat to hit the shopkeeper.

3. The summary states that the shopkeeper was hit by the robber with a baseball bat, but the article states that the shopkeeper's wife hit the robber with a baseball bat.

4. The summary does not mention the shopkeeper's wife helping to disarm the robber or hitting him with a baseball bat.

5. The summary states that the robber was arrested by the police, but the article does not mention the police arriving at the scene. Instead, it states that the shopkeeper and his wife helped to disarm the robber and held him down until he was arrested.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed information about the incident, including the actions of the shopkeeper and his wife, the weapons used, and the aftermath of the attempted robbery.
