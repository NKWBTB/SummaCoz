Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help you identify the inconsistencies in the summary. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The first inconsistency I noticed is that the summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is 22 years old, while the article states that she is 25 years old. This is a significant difference and could lead to incorrect information being conveyed.
2. The next inconsistency I noticed is that the summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown remains unresponsive, while the article states that she has "global and irreversible brain damage" and does not respond to visitors or familiar voices. The summary does not accurately convey the severity of her condition.
3. The summary also states that Bobbi Kristina Brown has a tracheostomy in her throat, which is not mentioned in the article. This is an inaccuracy in the summary.
4. The final inconsistency I noticed is that the summary states that an attorney for the Brown family said that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved, but the article states that her condition remains the same. This is a misrepresentation of the information in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains several inaccuracies. It is important to carefully review and fact-check summaries to ensure that they accurately convey the information in the original source.
