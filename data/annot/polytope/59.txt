     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved, but the article states that she remains in a state of global and irreversible brain damage.
2. The summary states that she is no longer in a medically induced coma, but the article states that she remains unresponsive and has a tracheostomy in her throat.
3. The summary states that doctors have indicated that she will have a long life, but the article states that the quality of her life will not be known for years to come.
4. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is embarking on a rehabilitation process, but the article states that she does not respond to visitors or familiar voices, and her eyes do not follow a person around the room.

Based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article paints a much more dire picture of Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition than the summary does.
