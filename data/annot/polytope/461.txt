</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti to move to Boca Juniors.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Pablo Osvaldo urging Pirlo and Totti to move to Boca Juniors. Instead, the article states that Osvaldo believes that the duo would be a good fit for Boca Juniors.
3. The summary omits the fact that Osvaldo is currently on a loan deal from Southampton and has become an instant hit, scoring three goals in six games.
4. The summary also omits the fact that Osvaldo believes that many of his former teammates are his friends, and he does not want to do injustice to anyone, but if he had to pick two, it would be Pirlo and Totti.
5. The summary only mentions that Pirlo has established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football and is hugely popular, but it does not mention that Totti is a Roma legend.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits several key points and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
