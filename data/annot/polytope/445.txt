pablo mandado and ilze zebolde have no plans , no agenda , no cause to fight for and they are certainly in no hurry -- the couple simply has a dream to ` discover different parts of this planet a pedal at a time . '
and , after quitting their restaurant jobs in manchester , the intrepid cyclists are doing it as cheaply as they possibly can .
spanish pablo , 27 , and latvian ilze , 31 , who met in riga in 2011 , are off to a flying start as they approach their first year of their open-ended odyssey on the road .
in 356 days so far they 've covered almost 7,000 miles ( 11,131.92 km by their measurements ) and been through 16 countries .

ilze points at the winding road that she and pablo had climb in spain 's sierra nevada with their 130 kg of gear ( including bicycles )
with no plans or agenda , ilze and pablo are happy to stop and take in stunning views , such as this from a roadside in the french alps
in that time they have been astonishingly living on less than three euros each a day , or by their meticulous calculations 10 euro cents per kilometre .
they keep costs down by relying on free accommodation , along with not needing a budget for transport -- their legs have that covered .
usually they pitch a tent under the stars and camp ( 161 nights of the 256 ) but also use hosting websites such as couchsurfing ( 66 nights ) and warmshowers ( 44 nights ) .
sometimes , they get a good night 's sleep courtesy of the kindness of strangers .
showers are ` sometimes daily , sometimes weekly , ' admits pablo .
this leaves food as their only major expense , and that takes up just 2.74 euros each per day of their 2.99 total outlay .
ilze often stars in their images with pablo the designated photographer , but she does n't seem to mind after another hill climb

when asked on their blog , thecrazytravel , how they can possibly live like this , pablo answered simply .
` pasta , bread , rice , eggs , milk , seasonal fruits and vegetables .
often we get invited for a meal , or for some free veggies or fruits , ' he said .
` we pick up wild fruits occasionally as well , and dumpster diving was an option in western countries where half of the food production end up in the bin . '
pablo and ilze started in london before heading south-east and working their way through france , first down the west coast and then the south after a loop through spain and portugal .
pedal power then took them through the north of italy , slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece and into turkey .

finally going further away and into the unknown . '
they traversed the entire northern coast of turkey , before riding through georgia and their latest destination , armenia , and they plan to ` continue into asia , across the pacific with the idea to cycle all the length of the american continent . '
` we are going to be on the road for the following years , ' they say .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pablo and Ilze have covered almost 7,000 miles and been through 16 countries, but the article states that they have covered 11,131.92 km and been through 16 countries.
2. The summary does not mention the fact that the couple is living on a tight budget and relies on free accommodation and cheap food to survive.
3. The summary does not mention the couple's dream to cycle all the length of the American continent and their plan to continue their journey for several years.
4. The summary does not mention the couple's reliance on hosting websites such as Couchsurfing and Warmshowers for accommodation.
5. The summary does not mention the couple's use of dumpster diving to obtain food.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include important details about the couple's journey, such as their budget, their long-term plans, and their unconventional living arrangements.
