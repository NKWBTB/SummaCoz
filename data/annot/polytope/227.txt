it comes after the home secretary implemented a rule allowing pccs to commission services for victims of crime .
last month ms baird boasted of the securing of funds for the charity in an article on its website .
` from april 1 , i become responsible for some victims ' services after funding was devolved by the ministry of justice to pccs , ' she wrote .
a northumbria police spokesman said the funds would be allocated ` in the same manner that victim support were directly funded by the moj ' .
but critics have described her selection of charity as ` inappropriate ' and a conflict of interest .
keith vaz , the labour chairman of the home affairs committee , said : ` northumbria police appears to have developed its own soap opera .
` it is totally inappropriate for a pcc to set up any organisation in which they have an interest of whatever kind using public money . '
in an article on the charity 's website , ms baird boasted of securing the funds from the public purse last month
mrs sim shot to prominence within the force over her handling of the hunt for raoul moat in 2010 .

adding the fact that chief constable sue sim was ` wrong ' , mr vaz said commissioners should never have been given the ability to allocate public funds to charity .
` the home secretary should never have given these powers . '
ms baird stood by her decision today , telling mailonline : ` all ministry of justice procedures and protocols were adhered to .
keith vaz accused the force of creating its own ` soap opera '
` i am confident the team of coordinators will show that the decisions taken to create victims first northumbria were the right ones . '
mrs sim has already announced that she will be retiring from the force in june .
she was previously accused of bullying staff and faced an investigation that was spearheaded by ms baird , her co-director at victims first northumbria .
a ministry of justice spokesman confirmed it would investigate the circumstances to conclude whether any conflict of interest rules had been broken .
` the moj requires pccs not to be subject to conflicts of interest when providing victims services and has the power to investigate any possible conflict of interest and to cease funding if such a conflict is established . '
victims first northumbria was established after the number of people contacting its predecessor , victim support , plummeted .
but sources say many may be reluctant to confide in a service that is partly run by mrs sim who faced misconduct proceedings over alleged workplace bullying before announcing her retirement last week .
the police chief who shot to prominence after her handling of the raoul moat manhunt in 2010 , said she was stepping down to spend more time with her family .
ms baird praised her ` passion and enthusiasm ' , adding : ` sue and i have worked well together over the two-and-a-half years since i became police and crime commissioner . '

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Vera Baird donated £500,000 to Victims First Northumbria, a charity she is a director of.
2. The article states that Vera Baird, as the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, allocated more than £500,000 of public money to the charity.
3. The article also states that Sue Sim, the Chief Constable of Northumbria Police, is a co-director of the charity with Vera Baird.
4. The article mentions that the pair are facing a Ministry of Justice probe over the allocation of public funds to the charity, with critics accusing them of concocting "a soap opera" within the force.
5. The summary does not mention the investigation or the conflict of interest concerns, only stating that Vera Baird donated £500,000 to the charity.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the important details about the investigation and conflict of interest concerns. The summary only provides a limited view of the situation and does not accurately represent the full scope of the article's content.
