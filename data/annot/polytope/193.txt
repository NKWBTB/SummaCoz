    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, which is one of the highest prices in the Premier League. However, the article states that the cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, which is not one of the highest prices in the Premier League.
2. The summary mentions that the protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. However, the article does not mention anything about empty seats or raising awareness.
3. The summary mentions that fans are protesting against the rising costs of modern football, but the article does not mention anything about the cost of modern football. Instead, it focuses on the specific issue of ticket prices.
4. The summary mentions that the protesters want tangible reductions in line with what working-class people earn, but the article does not mention anything about tangible reductions or working-class people.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article and omits other important details that are present in the article.
