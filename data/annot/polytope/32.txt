    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the provided summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps to explain my reasoning:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistent information
The inconsistent information is the statement that Michael Adebowale, one of the men convicted of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby, studied Arabic at the former European Institute of Human Sciences at Highmead, near Llanybydder. This information is not present in the article.

Step 2: Check the article for any mention of the European Institute of Human Sciences
There is no mention of the European Institute of Human Sciences in the article. The article only mentions the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit, the rural areas of West Wales, and the training locations in Ceredigion, Powys, and Pembrokeshire.

Step 3: Check the summary for any other inconsistencies
The summary also mentions that the center where Adebowale studied Arabic was set up by Iraqi clerics. However, there is no mention of Iraqi clerics setting up such a center in the article.

Step 4: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies
The inconsistencies in the summary are likely due to a lack of information or a misunderstanding of the article. The article does not mention the European Institute of Human Sciences or Iraqi clerics setting up such a center. The article only mentions the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit and the training locations in West Wales.

In conclusion, the provided summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as Michael Adebowale studying Arabic at the European Institute of Human Sciences. The inconsistencies are likely due to a lack of information or a misunderstanding of the article.
