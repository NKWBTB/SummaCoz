    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Bob Barker hosted the TV game show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007. However, the article states that he hosted the show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007.

2. The summary states that Bob Barker looked spry at 91 and handled the first price-guessing game before turning hosting duties over to Drew Carey. However, the article states that Drew Carey hosted the show and Bob Barker only appeared for a brief moment to handle the first price-guessing game before turning hosting duties over to Carey.

3. The summary states that Bob Barker did not seem to miss a beat despite being away from the show for most of the past eight years. However, the article states that Bob Barker returned to the show after being away for eight years.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that Bob Barker hosted the entire show and did not mention his brief appearance. Additionally, the summary states that Bob Barker has not been away from the show for eight years, which is not accurate according to the article.
