Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak. However, the article states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical, and that the blast occurred at the plant's oil storage facility, but it does not mention anything about an oil leak.
2. The summary mentions that five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. The article does not mention anything about injuries or casualties.
3. The summary states that more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and that the fire is now under control. The article mentions that more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze, but it does not mention anything about the fire being under control.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the plant being located in Zhangzhou city, the fact that the plant produces PX, or the protests and violent clashes that have occurred in the past due to the construction of PX plants.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article. The summary also fails to provide context and details about the plant and the incident, which are present in the article.
