     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the explosion occurred at an oil storage facility, but the article does not mention anything about an oil storage facility. Instead, the article states that the explosion occurred at a controversial chemical plant.
2. The summary mentions that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), but the article does not mention PX specifically. The article only states that the plant produces a "reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics."
3. The summary states that the explosion was caused by an oil leak, but the article does not mention any oil leak. Instead, the article states that the explosion was caused by a "leak" without specifying what type of leak it was.
4. The summary states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, but the article does not mention anything about broken glass or injuries.
5. The summary states that more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze, but the article only mentions that "more than 600 firefighters" were sent to battle the blaze without specifying the exact number.
6. The summary states that the fire is now under control, but the article does not mention anything about the fire being under control. Instead, the article states that the fire is "now under control" without specifying when or how it was brought under control.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. For example, it does not mention the controversial nature of the plant, the type of chemical produced, or the cause of the explosion. Additionally, it contains details that are not present in the article, such as broken glass and injuries.
