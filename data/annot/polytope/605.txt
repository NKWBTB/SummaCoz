Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Alice Barker was a dancer in New York nightspots such as the Cotton Club and the Cafe Zanzibar in the 1930s and 1940s.
2. The article also states that Alice Barker had never seen any of her own motion pictures or memorabilia, and had never seen herself actually dancing, until a video of "soundies" (early music videos) was shown to her at her nursing home.
3. However, the summary states that Alice Barker was a dancer in such New York UNKs as the Cotton Club, which is not accurate. There is no mention of UNKs in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes a made-up word ("UNK") and incorrect information about Alice Barker's background.
