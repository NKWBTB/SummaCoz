    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Lee Lewis Ferguson had a spectacular double somersault fall from his horse at Wincanton, which has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. However, the article does not mention anything about a spectacular fall or online views.
2. The summary states that Ferguson was flung from his horse in spectacular fashion at Wincanton, but the article does not use the word "flung" or "spectacular." Instead, it says that Ferguson had a fall and was back riding out the next day.
3. The summary states that Ferguson has a cut on his nose to show for his ordeal, but the article only mentions a cut on his nose without specifying that it was caused by the fall.
4. The summary states that Ferguson was an internet sensation and had gained hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers, but the article does not mention anything about internet fame or Twitter followers.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the severity of Ferguson's fall and adds details that are not present in the article.
