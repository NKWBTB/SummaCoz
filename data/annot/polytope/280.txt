    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Muto is considering a move to Chelsea because he wants to join a club where he will "play and develop." However, the article states that Muto is considering a move to Chelsea because he wants to join a club where he will "play regularly and realize his potential." The wording is slightly different, indicating that the summary may not accurately reflect the content of the article.
2. The summary mentions that Chelsea would loan Muto to partner club Vitesse Arnhem next season, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Chelsea would consider loaning Muto to another club if they sign him.
3. The summary quotes Muto as saying "where can I go to develop?" and "a team that suits me, where I can play and develop." However, these quotes are not found in the article. The article only quotes Muto as saying "I want to think about it carefully" and "I'm thinking about that, and for now I just want to take my time and think it through."
4. The summary mentions that Real Zaragoza boss Ranko Popovic gave Muto his debut for FC Tokyo in July 2013, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Muto was given his debut by FC Tokyo manager Naoki Ogane.
5. The summary quotes Popovic as saying that Muto has "amazing potential" and is "a different guy" who is "not such a usual player." However, these quotes are not found in the article. The article only quotes Popovic as saying that Muto is a "smart" and "intelligent" player who has "something different" to other players.

Overall, the summary appears to have taken some creative liberties with the content of the article, resulting in inconsistencies and inaccuracies.
