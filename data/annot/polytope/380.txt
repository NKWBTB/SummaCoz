    Article: 
    ( cnn ) with help from some filmmakers , 102-year-old alice barker went back in time .
barker was a dancer in such new york nightspots as the cotton club and the cafe zanzibar in the 1930s and 1940s , part of chorus lines that entertained alongside notables including bill " bojangles " robinson and frank sinatra .
there were motion pictures made of barker , but she had never seen any of them .
moreover , her photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years .
so she had never seen herself actually dancing -- until now .
mark cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of " soundies " -- early music videos -- and showed them to barker at the nursing home where she lives .
the ageless dancer was delighted .
" it 's just fabulous , " she said . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alice Barker went back in time with the help of some filmmakers, but the article does not mention anything about her going back in time. Instead, it talks about how she saw videos of herself dancing for the first time.
2. The summary mentions that Alice Barker was a dancer in the 1930s and 1940s, but the article does not provide any information about her dancing career.
3. The summary states that Alice Barker had lost all of her photographs and memorabilia over the years, but the article mentions that Mark Cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of "soundies" (early music videos) and showed them to her at her nursing home.
4. The summary quotes Alice Barker as saying "it's just fabulous," but the article does not include this quote.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention Alice Barker going back in time, and it focuses on how she saw videos of herself dancing for the first time, rather than her dancing career or her lost photographs and memorabilia.
