Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step explanation of why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets on Wednesday to progress to the semi-finals of the Miami Open. However, the article states that Williams beat Lisicki in three sets on Wednesday to progress to the semi-finals, but only after Lisicki had defeated Venus Williams in the previous round.
2. The summary does not mention the fact that Venus Williams was defeated by Lisicki before Serena Williams played her quarter-final match. The article mentions this fact, but the summary does not.
3. The summary states that Serena Williams will face either Sloane Stephens or Simona Halep in the semi-finals, but the article states that Williams will face Halep for a place in the final after Halep beat Stephens in the other semi-final match.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that Andy Murray also received a celebratory cake after his 500th win, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article. It omits important details, such as Venus Williams' defeat and Andy Murray's celebration, and includes inaccurate information, such as the incorrect statement that Serena Williams beat Lisicki in three sets without any prior defeats.
