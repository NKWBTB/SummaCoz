    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets to progress to the semi-finals of the Miami Open.
2. However, the article states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets, but the third set was a tight one, with Serena Williams eventually winning 7-6, 1-6, 6-3.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the third set being a tight one or Serena Williams struggling to win it. Instead, it simply states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the match. Specifically, it does not mention the tight third set and Serena Williams' struggle to win it.
5. Additionally, the summary mentions that Serena Williams will face either Sloane Stephens or Simona Halep in the semi-finals, but the article states that Simona Halep beat Sloane Stephens in straight sets, so it is not accurate to say that Serena Williams will face either of them in the semi-finals.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the match and makes assumptions about the next round that are not supported by the article.
