    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Release date: The summary states that the movie was released this week, but the article states that the movie was released on Tuesday evening.
2. Image posting: The summary states that James Haskell posted the image on Thursday, but the article states that he posted the image on Tuesday evening.
3. Message: The summary states that the message in the Instagram post was "avengers movie is out so thought i would release the inner iron man", but the article states that the message was " ` avengers movie is out so thought i would release the inner iron man. @underarmouruk #transformyourself #iwill #avengersageofultron. "
4. Return to the club: The summary states that James Haskell returned to the club where he started his career for the 2012 season, but the article states that he returned to Wasps for the 2012 season after spells with Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams, and Highlanders in New Zealand.
5. Appearances: The summary states that Haskell has surpassed the 100 appearances mark for the club since returning to England, but the article states that he has made only 12 appearances since returning to England.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed information about James Haskell's career and the release of the Avengers: Age of Ultron movie.
