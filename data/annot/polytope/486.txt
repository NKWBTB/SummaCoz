     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the Liverpool players were led to believe that Bas van Velzen was a competition winner who had won the opportunity to meet the Anfield stars and receive a dead-ball masterclass. However, the article does not mention anything about a competition or the players being led to believe that Van Velzen was a winner.
2. The summary mentions that Van Velzen showcased his skills in front of goal, but the article does not mention any specific skills or actions taken by Van Velzen. Instead, the article focuses on his dead-ball skills and how he wowed the Liverpool quartet with his free-kick abilities.
3. The summary states that Balotelli and his team-mates were not dealing with a regular fan, implying that they were surprised by Van Velzen's skills. However, the article does not mention any surprise or unexpectedness from the players. Instead, it highlights how Van Velzen impressed the players with his dead-ball skills.
4. The summary mentions that Van Velzen became a YouTube sensation by uploading videos of his free-kick exploits, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that Balotelli and Lambert watched as Van Velzen showcased his dead-ball skills, but the article does not mention any specific actions taken by Balotelli or Lambert. Instead, it focuses on how Van Velzen impressed the Liverpool quartet with his free-kick abilities.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not mentioned in the article, such as a competition and Van Velzen's skills in front of goal, and omits other important details, such as Van Velzen's YouTube fame and the players' reactions to his dead-ball skills.
