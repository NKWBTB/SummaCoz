Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Liverpool players, Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini, Rickie Lambert, and Lazar Markovic, met Bas van Velzen, a YouTube star.
2. However, the article states that the players were led to believe that van Velzen was a competition winner who had won the opportunity to meet the Anfield stars and receive a dead-ball masterclass.
3. The summary does not mention anything about a competition or the players being led to believe that van Velzen was a regular fan.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the circumstances under which the players met van Velzen.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the competition or the players' belief that van Velzen was a regular fan. The summary only states that the players met van Velzen and watched him showcase his dead-ball skills, which is not the full context of the situation as described in the article.
