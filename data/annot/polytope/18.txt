     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the couple was struck by an Amtrak train "shortly before 10 am on Easter Sunday," while the article states that the accident occurred "on Easter morning."
2. The summary mentions that the train was heading north, while the article states that the train was heading from Charlotte to New York City.
3. The summary does not mention the name of the train, while the article refers to it as "Train No. 80, the Carolinian."
4. The summary states that the train continued on its route after a delay of about two hours and 45 minutes, while the article states that the train was delayed for almost three hours before continuing on its way.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that a man who fell ill during the delay received treatment, while the article does.
6. The summary does not mention the location of the accident, while the article states that it occurred in Durham, North Carolina.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
