Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Timeline: The summary states that Gerrard is aiming to end his Liverpool career by making the FA Cup final and beating Arsenal, but the article states that Gerrard will sign off his Anfield career in the final which takes place on his birthday of May 30, before moving to LA Galaxy.
2. Replacement: The summary suggests that Skrtel believes Liverpool have the players to fill Gerrard's void, but the article states that Skrtel admits Liverpool will be a different side without Gerrard among their ranks.
3. Return to the line-up: The summary mentions that both Gerrard and Skrtel could return to the Liverpool line-up for the match against Villa, but the article states that both players served three-match bans for violent conduct in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United in March.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistencies can be explained as follows:

1. The summary does not accurately reflect Gerrard's timeline for leaving Liverpool, as it states that he is aiming to end his career by beating Arsenal in the FA Cup final, while the article states that he will sign off his Anfield career on his birthday before moving to LA Galaxy.
2. The summary suggests that Liverpool have players to fill Gerrard's void, but the article states that Skrtel admits that Liverpool will be a different side without Gerrard.
3. The summary mentions the possibility of Gerrard and Skrtel returning to the line-up for the match against Villa, but the article states that both players served three-match bans for violent conduct.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistencies can be explained by the differences in the timeline, replacement, and return to the line-up.
