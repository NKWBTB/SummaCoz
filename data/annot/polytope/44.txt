1. The summary states that Steven Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, but the article does not mention this. While the article does quote Martin Skrtel as saying that Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, the article does not provide any information to support this claim.
2. The summary states that Gerrard is aiming to end his Liverpool career by making the FA Cup final and beating Arsenal, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that Gerrard is set to feature in the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa and that he will sign off his Anfield career in the final should Liverpool emerge victorious.
3. The summary states that Skrtel believes Liverpool will be a different side without Gerrard, but the article does not mention this. While the article does quote Skrtel as saying that Liverpool will miss Gerrard, the article does not provide any information to suggest that Skrtel believes the club will be a different side without him.
4. The summary states that Skrtel has praised the impact and example Gerrard has set during his time at Liverpool, but the article does not mention this. While the article does quote Skrtel as saying that Gerrard has been a help to him and that he has set an example, the article does not provide any information to suggest that Skrtel has praised Gerrard's impact and example.
