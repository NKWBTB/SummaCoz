it wants mps to set up a statutory body to regulate the press , as recommended by the leveson inquiry .
the news that o'carroll is a backer of hacked off will be an embarrassment to the group .
pie was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the national council for civil liberties ( nccl ) .
the nccl lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child ` understood the nature of the act ' and apparently consented .
the group also wanted incest to be legalised .
o'carroll was on the nccl 's gay rights sub-committee .
the 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ` corrupting public morals ' .
he wrote a blog after the february meeting , chaired by comedian john cleese , confirming his attendance .

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll, a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off. However, the article states that O'Carroll is a former member of PIE, not a leading member.
2. The summary does not mention that PIE campaigned to legalize child sex in the 1970s and 80s, while the article reveals this information.
3. The summary does not mention that O'Carroll was jailed in 1981 for "corrupting public morals," which is mentioned in the article.
4. The summary states that Hacked Off is campaigning against the "biased and unfair" Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), but the article does not mention IPSO.
5. The summary mentions that O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament, but the article states that the rally was chaired by comedian John Cleese.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide an accurate representation of the information provided in the article. The summary omits important details about O'Carroll's background and the goals of PIE, and it misrepresents the focus of Hacked Off's campaign.
