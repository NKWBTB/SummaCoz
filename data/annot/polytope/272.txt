Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Emotionlessness: The summary states that Lacey Spears appeared emotionless as the verdict was read, but the article states that she showed no emotion when she was sentenced. This is a significant difference, as the summary implies that she was emotionless throughout the trial, while the article suggests that she showed no emotion only during the sentencing.
2. Father's emotions: The summary states that the boy's father, Chris Hill, was not emotionless and wrote on Facebook that he hoped his wife would die in prison. However, the article states that he expressed his hope that she would die in prison, but also noted that he was tired of crying over the loss of his boy. This difference in wording implies that the father was more emotional than the summary suggests.
3. Sentence: The summary states that Lacey Spears received 20 years to life in prison, while the article states that she was spared the maximum 25 years to life and instead received 20 years. This difference in wording implies that the summary is more severe in its punishment of Lacey Spears.
4. Appeal: The summary does not mention anything about the defense's plans to appeal the sentence, while the article states that the defense plans to appeal.
5. Prosecutors' blame: The summary states that prosecutors blamed Lacey Spears for her son's short and tormented life, while the article states that prosecutors blamed her for her son's tortured death. This difference in wording implies that the summary is more sympathetic towards the prosecution's argument.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or distorts several key details, including Lacey Spears' emotions, the father's emotions, the sentence, the appeal, and the prosecutors' blame. These differences suggest that the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
