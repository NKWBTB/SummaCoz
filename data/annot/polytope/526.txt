    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Gary Locke has lost just once in seven games since taking over at Rugby Park.
2. The article states that Locke has lost just once in seven games since taking over as interim manager at Rugby Park.
3. However, the article also states that Locke has been given the job on a permanent basis, which means that he has not lost any games as the permanent manager.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Locke has lost once in seven games, while the article states that he has not lost any games as the permanent manager.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the summary is based on Locke's performance as the interim manager, while the article is about his permanent appointment.
