    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that a third of men have never picked up a bucket or chamois leather to clean their own car, while the article states that 31% of men have never washed their own car. This is a difference of 2%.
2. The summary states that only 12% of men who do wash their own car do it regularly, while the article states that only 5% of those surveyed said they had ever asked their children to wash the car as a way for them to earn extra pocket money. This implies that more men are washing their own cars regularly than the summary suggests.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the rise of hand car washes and the size of 4x4 and off-road vehicles are given as reasons for not washing cars, which are mentioned in the article.
4. The summary states that Brits are more likely to wash their own cars during holidays, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary mentions that cars are most likely to be washed by their owners every week in Birmingham, Chelmsford, and Sheffield, and least likely in Oxford, Bath, and Edinburgh, but the article does not provide this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the information provided in the article, particularly with regards to the percentage of men who have never washed their own car, the frequency of washing, and the reasons for not washing.
