    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott has spent much of the season on the bench, which is true.
2. However, the summary also states that Walcott will be hoping to make his first Arsenal start since the side's 3-0 win over West Ham on March 14, which is not consistent with the article. According to the article, Walcott has been named on the substitutes' bench for 17 of Arsenal's 33 Premier League games, indicating that he has already made several starts for the team this season.
3. Furthermore, the article states that Walcott and his teammates posed for a photoshoot with Lanvin, a Parisian fashion house, which is not mentioned in the summary.
4. Lastly, the summary mentions that Arsenal will face Hull at the KC Stadium on Monday, which is not accurate as the team is scheduled to face Hull at the Emirates Stadium on May 30, according to the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains inaccuracies and omissions.
