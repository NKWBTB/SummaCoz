1. The article states that Alice Barker was a dancer in New York nightspots such as the Cotton Club and the Cafe Zanzibar in the 1930s and 1940s.
2. The article also states that she had never seen any motion pictures of herself dancing before, and that her photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years.
3. The summary states that Alice Barker was in a video of her music videos. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of her being in any music videos.
4. The summary also states that she said she didn't know what she had dancing. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that she was delighted to see the video of her dancing.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and it also misrepresents some of the information that is present in the article.
