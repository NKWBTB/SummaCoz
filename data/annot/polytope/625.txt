    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "New Zealand" but the article does not mention New Zealand at all. The article is about a fashion show held at Bondi's Icebergs Club in Australia.
2. The summary states that the pool was drained for the fashion folk, but the article does not mention anything about the pool being drained. Instead, the article states that the pool was used as a catwalk setting for the fashion show.
3. The summary mentions a collection of ten pieces of clothing, but the article does not mention the specific number of pieces in the collection. The article only mentions that the collection was presented in a capsule form.
4. The summary states that the collection was designed to be worn by both sexes, but the article does not mention this detail.
5. The summary mentions a presentation taking place on a warm and sunny day, but the article does not mention the weather conditions during the fashion show.
6. The summary mentions passers-by stopping to watch the show from the road above the pool, but the article does not mention this detail.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important details that are mentioned in the article.
