    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the provided summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary states that Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia beat Germany's Sabine Lisicki for a 2-0 lead in their Fed Cup tie, while the article states that Russia is on the brink of making the Fed Cup final with a 2-0 lead after Pavlyuchenkova saved a match point to beat Lisicki.

Step 2: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies

The reason for the inconsistency is that the summary does not accurately convey the content of the article. Specifically:

* The summary states that Pavlyuchenkova beat Lisicki 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3, while the article states that Pavlyuchenkova saved a match point in the second set before going on to beat Lisicki 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3.
* The summary does not mention that Pavlyuchenkova saved a match point in the second set, which is a significant detail that is included in the article.
* The summary also does not accurately convey Lisicki's comments about her power causing problems for Pavlyuchenkova, which are included in the article.

Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the inconsistencies

The inconsistencies in the summary have a significant impact on the reader's understanding of the article, as they do not accurately convey the content of the article. Specifically, the summary does not convey the full detail of Pavlyuchenkova's win, and does not accurately represent Lisicki's comments about her power.

Step 4: Provide recommendations for improvement

To improve the consistency of the summary, the following changes could be made:

* Include all relevant details from the article, such as Pavlyuchenkova saving a match point in the second set and Lisicki's comments about her power.
* Use more accurate language to convey the content of the article, such as using "match point" instead of "close" to describe the second set.
* Avoid using language that is not supported by the article, such as "boom-boom" to describe Lisicki's power.
