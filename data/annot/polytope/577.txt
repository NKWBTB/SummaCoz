Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Inconsistent information: The summary states that Serena Williams beat "UNK UNK" in the Miami Open, but the article clearly states that she played against Sabine Lisicki and won in three sets (7-6, 1-6, 6-3).
2. Incorrect score: The summary mentions a 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 score, but the article states that Williams won 7-6, 1-6, 6-3.
3. Missing information: The summary does not mention Andy Murray, who was also featured in the article as he celebrated his 500th win with a cake presentation.
4. Incorrect opponent: The summary mentions "Romania's Simona Halep" as Williams' opponent in the semi-finals, but the article states that Halep beat Sloane Stephens to reach the semi-finals, not Williams.

Overall, the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content, and it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
