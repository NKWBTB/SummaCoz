</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman was arrested after apparently dumping her newborn baby in a rubbish bin in a fast-food restaurant.
2. However, the article states that the baby was found in the ladies' toilet, not in a rubbish bin.
3. The summary also states that the baby was wrapped in a shirt but was still attached to the umbilical cord and placenta, which is not mentioned in the article.
4. The article states that the woman, Yuan Yen, was found to have blood on her when she was approached, but the summary does not mention this detail.
5. The summary states that the woman refused to look at her baby or talk to police, but the article states that she was in a trance and did not speak.
6. The summary also states that the woman faces charges of neglect, but the article does not mention this.
7. Finally, the summary does not mention that the baby was declared healthy after being checked over by doctors, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
