Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The first inconsistency I notice is in the summary, where it says "anastasia UNK saved the match point in the second set to beat germany's andrea UNK in straight sets." However, in the article, it is clear that the player's name is Sabine Lisicki, not Andrea UNK.
2. The next inconsistency is that the summary states that Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Julia UNK in straight sets, but in the article, it is clear that the player's name is Julia Goerges.
3. Additionally, the summary states that Russia needs one win from Sunday's three matches to reach the final, but the article does not mention anything about needing one win.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains several errors, including incorrect names and incorrect information about the match results.
