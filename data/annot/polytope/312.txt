</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Dani Alves will leave Barcelona this summer due to being unable to agree a new deal with the club.
2. The article states that Alves has rejected a three-year contract extension offer from Barcelona, and his agent (and ex-wife) Dinorah Santana confirmed that the negotiations are over.
3. The summary does not mention the reason for Alves' departure, while the article reveals that it is due to the failed contract negotiations.
4. The summary mentions that Alves has been linked with Manchester United and Manchester City, but the article does not mention any specific clubs that have made offers for Alves' signature.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and accuracy as the article. The summary only mentions the fact that Alves will leave Barcelona, but does not provide the reason for his departure or the clubs he has been linked with.
