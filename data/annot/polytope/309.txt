</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that James Haskell showed off his "inner iron man" in a serious-looking Instagram post. However, the article does not mention anything about James Haskell dressing up as Iron Man or showing off an inner Iron Man.
2. The article does mention that James Haskell posted an image on Instagram, but the image was not of him dressed as Iron Man. Instead, the image was of him dressed in a London Wasps jersey, with the caption "back to where it all started #wasps #londonwasps #englandrugby".
3. The summary also states that the highly-anticipated movie premiered at Westfield London shopping centre on Tuesday evening, but the article does not mention anything about a movie premiere.
4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, such as James Haskell dressing up as Iron Man, and omits information that is present in the article, such as the fact that the image he posted was of him in a London Wasps jersey.
