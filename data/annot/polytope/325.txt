Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the given article and summary, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary only mentions the draining of the pool for a catwalk, while the article provides more details about the event, such as the reason for the draining (for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia), the use of the empty pool as a catwalk, and the show's unique location.
2. The summary does not mention the name of the label, "Ten Pieces," which is prominently featured in the article.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the collection was presented in an unusual location, which was a catwalk set up in the empty pool, and instead only states that the location was "show-stopping."
4. The summary does not mention the androgynous nature of the collection, which was a key aspect of the article.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that the collection was designed to be worn in 20 different ways, which was also a key aspect of the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the article's content, and is therefore not consistent with the article.
