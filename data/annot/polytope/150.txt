     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Lu Xincai takes his mother with him to work on the back of his motorbike every day, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Lu Xincai takes his mother to work with him on the back of his motorbike every day, which is a different phrase and implies a more frequent or regular occurrence.
2. The summary mentions that Lu Xincai's mother suffers from Alzheimer's and used to get lost when she was left alone, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Lu Xincai's mother has been given a degenerative disease, which is a more general term that does not specifically mention Alzheimer's.
3. The summary states that Lu Xincai ties a sash around both of their waists to ensure that his mother does not fall off, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Lu Xincai ties a sash around both of their waists to make sure she does not fall off, which is a different phrase and implies a more practical purpose.
4. The summary mentions that Lu Xincai's mother would often go up to the mountains to collect firewood, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Lu Xincai's mother used to go to the fields and collect firewood when she was young, which is a different context and does not imply that she still does this.
5. The summary states that Lu Xincai's father passed away earlier this year, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Lu Xincai's father died several years ago, which is a different timeframe and does not match the information in the summary.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies compared to the article.
