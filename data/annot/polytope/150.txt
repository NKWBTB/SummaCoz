</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Lu Xincai takes his 84-year-old mother to work with him on the back of his motorbike every day.
2. The article does not mention that Lu Xincai takes his mother to work every day. Instead, it states that he takes her with him to work on the back of his motorbike every single day, suggesting that he takes her to work occasionally or on certain days, rather than every day.
3. The summary also states that Lu Xincai's mother suffers from Alzheimer's and used to get lost when she was left alone.
4. The article does not mention that Lu Xincai's mother used to get lost when she was left alone. Instead, it states that she would often go up to the mountains to collect firewood and there were a few occasions when she got lost after dark.
5. The summary does not provide any information about Lu Xincai's father passing away, which is mentioned in the article.
6. The summary states that Lu Xincai ties a sash around both of their waists to ensure that his mother does not fall off.
7. The article does mention that Lu Xincai ties a sash around both of their waists, but it does not specify that this is to prevent his mother from falling off. Instead, it suggests that the sash is a precautionary measure to ensure that his mother does not get lost.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the frequency of Lu Xincai taking his mother to work, misrepresents his mother's condition, and omits important information about his father's passing and the reason for taking his mother to work.
