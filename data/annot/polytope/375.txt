    Article: 
    every woman surveyed in paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city 's public transport .

the poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains .
the survey found that " every female user of mass transit has been a victim " of " gender harassment or sexual assault " -- even though some are " unaware " of this because they have been conditioned to accept low-level abuse .
every woman surveyed in paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city 's public transport
the poll of 600 women from the area around paris found that half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18 .
harassment can range from " insults to other intimidating behaviour ( insistent flirting , whistling , comments on appearance ) , to sex attacks or rape , " it said .
the problem meant that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men .
often " invisible " because unreported , these physical and verbal attacks limit " the freedom of women , because they are often obligated to alter their daily lives : changing their routes , modes of transportation , schedules , attitudes and clothing in order to avoid confrontation , " the report handed to the french women 's rights ministry this week , claimed .
the result was to " exclude women from the public arena " , it said .
pascale boisard , president of the high council for gender equality , which compiled the report , told le parisien she had not realised that " the problem was quite this widespread " .
the poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains .

" women must be able to move about and occupy the public space without being placed in danger or threatened .
it 's a fundamental freedom , " she said .
ernestine ronai , also on the council , said : " attackers are the impression they can act with total impunity , notably by making use of a crowd to hide and flee .
" women do n't necessarily know how to put words on what they go through in public transport .
it should be reiterated that putting your hand on someone 's backside is sexual assault punishable by a five-year prison term and a â‚¬ 75,000 fine . "
she said women needed to be better " educated that what they 're going through is not normal " , and that the message must reach " aggressors and witnesses " . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "half of them were assaulted before they were 18 years old," which is not supported by the article. The article states that "every woman surveyed in Paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city's public transport," but it does not specify the age of the women who were assaulted.
2. The summary also states that "the poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behavior on buses and trains," but the article does not mention any calls for a campaign. Instead, it states that the poll found that "every female user of mass transit has been a victim" of "gender harassment or sexual assault," and that the problem is so widespread that six out of ten women are afraid of being attacked on public transport.
3. The summary does not mention the finding that "women must be able to move about and occupy the public space without being placed in danger or threatened" (quoted in the article), which is a key point made in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
