</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "a third of men have never picked up a bucket and a chamois leather to wash their own car." This statement is not consistent with the article, as the article states that 31% of men have never washed their own car, but does not mention using a bucket and chamois leather.
2. The summary also states that the rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars. This is not supported by the article, which does not mention hand car washes as a factor in the decline of self-car washing.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the reasons for the decline of self-car washing, while the article provides several reasons, such as the rise of automated car washes, the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean, and the fact that people have less time.
4. The summary does not mention the survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm OSV, which is a key finding of the article.

Overall, the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content and leaves out important information.
