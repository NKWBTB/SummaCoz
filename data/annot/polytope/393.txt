Medical condition: The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown has "global and irreversible brain damage," while the article states that she remains in a neurological state that she has been in for nearly three months and does not respond to visitors or familiar voices, and her eyes do not follow a person around the room. The article does not mention "global and irreversible brain damage."
3. Tracheostomy: The summary mentions that Bobbi Kristina Brown has a tracheostomy in her throat, but the article does not mention this.
4. Improvement in condition: The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved, but the article states that her condition remains the same and she is still unresponsive.
5. Rehabilitation: The summary mentions that Bobbi Kristina Brown is embarking on a rehabilitation process, but the article does not mention this.
