Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Andy Murray received a huge cake after his 500th win, but the article does not mention any cake for Murray.
2. The summary mentions that Serena Williams progressed to the semi-finals with a 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 progression over Sabine Lisicki, but the article states that Williams beat Lisicki in three sets, not 7-6, 1-6, 6-3.
3. The summary states that Simona Halep beat Sloane Stephens 6-1, 7-5 to reach the semi-finals, but the article states that Halep beat Stephens 6-1, 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals, not the semi-finals.

Therefore, the summary contains several inaccuracies and is not consistent with the article.
