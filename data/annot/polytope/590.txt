Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Chelsea have been in the top flight for a season since joining Lille. This is incorrect, as Chelsea have never joined Lille.
2. The article states that Mouscron had a partnership with Lille, but that partnership is now set to end. The summary does not mention this, implying that Mouscron is still in partnership with Lille.
3. The article states that Mouscron are currently 13th in the Belgian Pro League, two points above the relegation places. The summary does not mention the team's current position in the league.
4. The article mentions that Chelsea are in early discussions over a possible partnership with Mouscron, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about Chelsea and Mouscron, and it omits important details about the teams' current situations.
