    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Chelsea have been in the top flight for a season since joining Lille, but the article does not mention anything about Chelsea joining Lille.
2. The summary also states that the Belgian club has been in the top flight for a season since last summer, but the article does not mention when the Belgian club was promoted or when their partnership with Lille ended.
3. The summary mentions nothing about Chelsea being in early discussions over a possible partnership with Belgian club Royal Mouscron-Peruwelz, which is the main focus of the article.
4. The article states that Mouscron are currently 13th in Belgium's Pro League, but the summary does not mention their current league position.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that Chelsea already have an agreement with Vitesse Arnhem in Holland, or that they have been looking at other link-ups across Europe to help develop their squad.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the main points or details of the article.
