     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Age: The summary states that the child is five years old, but the article states that he is four years old.
2. Name: The summary uses the name "Mai Zizhuo," but the article uses the name "Mai Zizhou."
3. Basketball skills: The summary highlights the child's ability to dribble two basketballs at once and score hoops, but the article does not mention these specific skills. Instead, it focuses on the child's overall basketball skills and how they have won him legions of fans.
4. Yao Ming: The summary mentions that the child is being compared to Yao Ming, but the article does not mention Yao Ming.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the child's age, name, and basketball skills, and adds details that are not present in the article.
