Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Inconsistent information: The summary states that the five-year-old child, Mai Zizhuo, has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention the child's age or when he started playing basketball.
2. Incorrect information: The summary states that Mai Zizhuo is Shanghai-born Yao Ming, who played for the NBA's Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011. This is incorrect, as Yao Ming is a professional basketball player, not a five-year-old child.
3. Missing information: The summary does not include any information about the viral video that is mentioned in the article, which shows Mai Zizhuo displaying his basketball skills.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains incorrect and missing information.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming , who played for nba 's houston rockets from 2002 to 2011. But in the article it mentions mai zizhuo and yao ming are not the same person. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
