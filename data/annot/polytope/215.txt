     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Chelsea are in early discussions over a possible partnership with Belgian club Royal Mouscron-Peruwelz, but the article does not mention any such discussions.
2. The summary mentions that Mouscron had a partnership with Lille, but the article states that Mouscron had a partnership with Vitesse Arnhem, not Lille.
3. The summary states that Mouscron are currently 13th in the table, two points above the relegation places, but the article does not mention the club's current league position.
4. The summary mentions that Chelsea have an agreement with Vitesse Arnhem, but the article does not mention any such agreement.
5. The summary states that Bertrand Traore is one of three players currently on loan at Vitesse Arnhem from Chelsea this season, but the article does not mention Traore or any other Chelsea players on loan at Vitesse.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and omissions compared to the article. It is not a consistent summary of the article's content.
