     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Stephen Curry broke his own NBA three-point record, but the article states that he eclipsed his own record for most 3-pointers in a season.

2. The summary mentions that Curry hit eight three-pointers to eclipse his previous record, but the article states that he hit six before halftime and eight overall.

3. The summary does not mention the name of the team that Curry played against, while the article states that the Golden State Warriors beat the Portland Trail Blazers.

4. The summary mentions that the Warriors avoided their first three-game losing streak this season, but this information is not present in the article.

5. The summary mentions that Pau Gasol had 16 points and 15 rebounds for the Chicago Bulls, but this information is not present in the article.

6. The summary mentions that the Bulls easily wiped out a 19-point halftime deficit, but the article states that they went on a staggering 39-8 run to open the second half.

7. The summary mentions that the Heat missed their first 12 shots after halftime, but the article states that they were outscored 57-27 after halftime.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. It should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
