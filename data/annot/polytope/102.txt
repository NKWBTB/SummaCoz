    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Carwyn fell to his death while skiing in Flaine, France, while the article states that he fell over a 164ft drop in woodland while skiing with his family.
2. The summary mentions that Carwyn's mother, Ceri, and siblings were also on the skiing trip, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that Carwyn was a "very competent skier and snowboarder" who had started skiing at the age of three, but the article does not mention his skiing abilities or experience.
4. The summary mentions that Carwyn's family described him as "adorable, caring, and full of laughter," but the article does not include these quotes.
5. The summary states that the family had spent "the most happy ski holiday together" in Flaine before the tragedy struck, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains details that are not mentioned in the article, such as the location of the fall and Carwyn's skiing abilities, and omits other important details, such as the fact that his family was with him when he fell.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states "his mother , ceri , nine , and brother gerwyn , 19 , also died in woodland", while the articles states that "fell to his death while on holiday with his mother ceri , nine-year-old sister antonia and brother gerwyn , 19". The article only stated that Carwyn fell to his death, and did not state that his mother and sibling also fell to their death.
