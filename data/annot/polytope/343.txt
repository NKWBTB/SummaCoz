    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the protest was against ticket prices, but the article does not mention ticket prices as the specific issue that the protest was about. Instead, the article focuses on the rising costs of following football clubs in general.
2. The summary mentions that the cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions that tickets at the sold-out Emirates Stadium started from £64 for the 12.45 pm kick-off.
3. The summary states that fans are "disgusted" at the continuing rise of ticket prices, but the article does not use that specific wording. Instead, the article quotes fans as saying they are "extorted" and that the rising costs of following football clubs are a struggle.
4. The summary mentions that the protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs, but the article does not mention anything about empty seats or the image of empty seats being used to raise awareness.
5. The summary mentions that fans from all clubs are coming together to protest, but the article only mentions Arsenal and Liverpool fans protesting.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it highlights specific issues and details that are not present in the article.
