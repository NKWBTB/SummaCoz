Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the given article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the issues:

1. Inconsistent language: The summary uses the hashtag symbol (#) to indicate the cost of tickets, which is not consistent with the language used in the article. The article uses the word "pound" (£) to indicate the cost of tickets, which should be followed consistently throughout the summary.
2. Incorrect cost: The summary states that tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from £64, which is incorrect. The article states that the cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, but the highest prices in the Premier League.
3. Omitted information: The summary does not mention the protesters' demands for tangible reductions in ticket prices, which is a key point in the article. Additionally, the summary does not mention the banners held up inside and outside the ground, which is a significant aspect of the protest.
4. Incorrect time frame: The summary states that the protest took place for the first 10 minutes of the lunchtime kick-off, which is incorrect. The article states that the protest took place for the first 10 minutes of the game.
5. Incorrect phrase: The summary uses the phrase "a section of arsenal and liverpool fans" which is not consistent with the article, which uses the phrase "supporters from both clubs".

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because of the inconsistent language, incorrect cost, omitted information, incorrect time frame, and incorrect phrase. To make the summary consistent with the article, the language should be consistent, the cost should be correct, the omitted information should be included, the time frame should be correct, and the phrase should be consistent with the article.
