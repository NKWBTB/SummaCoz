    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Alice Barker went back in time with the help of some filmmakers, but the article does not mention anything about time travel.
2. The summary mentions that Alice Barker had never seen any of her motion pictures or memorabilia, but the article states that there were motion pictures made of her and that she had seen them.
3. The summary states that Mark Cantor and some volunteers showed Alice Barker a video of "soundies" (early music videos), but the article does not mention anything about "soundies" or videos. Instead, it states that they showed her motion pictures of herself dancing.
4. The summary quotes Alice Barker as saying "it's just fabulous," but the article does not include this quote.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains elements that are not present in the article, such as time travel and "soundies." Additionally, the summary leaves out elements that are present in the article, such as the fact that Alice Barker had seen her motion pictures before and that she was shown motion pictures of herself dancing, not "soundies."
