Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Alice Barker was a dancer in the 1930s and 1940s, but the summary does not mention her dancing career.
2. The article mentions that Alice Barker had never seen any of her motion pictures or photographs, but the summary does not include this detail.
3. The article states that Mark Cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of "soundies" and showed them to Alice Barker at her nursing home, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include important details about Alice Barker's dancing career and her reaction to the video of "soundies" that was shown to her.
