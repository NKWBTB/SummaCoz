</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Dani Alves has rejected Barcelona's final contract offer, and will leave the club this summer.
2. However, the article states that Alves' agent, Dinorah Santana, confirmed that her client had rejected a three-year contract extension, but did not mention anything about a final contract offer.
3. The article also mentions that Alves has been unable to agree a new deal with the club, but does not specify whether he has rejected a specific offer.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Alves has rejected a final contract offer, which is not explicitly stated in the article.
5. The article only mentions that Alves' agent confirmed that he had rejected a three-year contract extension, but does not provide any information about a final contract offer.
6. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article, and remove any information that is not supported by the article.
