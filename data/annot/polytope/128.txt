    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Dani Alves rejected Barcelona's final contract offer, but the article states that the negotiations are over and Alves has not yet been approached by big-spending PSG.
2. The summary mentions that Alves will leave Barcelona this summer, but the article does not confirm this. In fact, it states that the negotiations are over, but does not mention anything about Alves leaving the club.
3. The summary states that Alves has been unable to agree a new deal with Barcelona, but the article states that the negotiations are over and Alves has not yet been approached by big-spending PSG.
4. The summary mentions that Alves has been linked with Manchester United and Manchester City, but the article does not mention these clubs.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the summary states that Alves rejected Barcelona's final contract offer, will leave the club this summer, and has been linked with specific clubs (Manchester United and Manchester City) that are not mentioned in the article.
