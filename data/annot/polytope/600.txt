every woman surveyed in paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city 's public transport
the poll of 600 women from the area around paris found that half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18 .
harassment can range from " insults to other intimidating behaviour ( insistent flirting , whistling , comments on appearance ) , to sex attacks or rape , " it said .
the problem meant that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men .
often " invisible " because unreported , these physical and verbal attacks limit " the freedom of women , because they are often obligated to alter their daily lives : changing their routes , modes of transportation , schedules , attitudes and clothing in order to avoid confrontation , " the report handed to the french women 's rights ministry this week , claimed .
the result was to " exclude women from the public arena " , it said .
pascale boisard , president of the high council for gender equality , which compiled the report , told le parisien she had not realised that " the problem was quite this widespread " .
the poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains .

" women must be able to move about and occupy the public space without being placed in danger or threatened .
it 's a fundamental freedom , " she said .
ernestine ronai , also on the council , said : " attackers are the impression they can act with total impunity , notably by making use of a crowd to hide and flee .
" women do n't necessarily know how to put words on what they go through in public transport .
it should be reiterated that putting your hand on someone 's backside is sexual assault punishable by a five-year prison term and a â‚¬ 75,000 fine . "
she said women needed to be better " educated that what they 're going through is not normal " , and that the message must reach " aggressors and witnesses " . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that. Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18." However, the article does not mention anything about the age of the women who were interviewed. The article only states that "every woman surveyed in Paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city's public transport."
2. The summary mentions that "harassment can range from 'insults to other intimidating behaviour (insistent flirting, whistling, comments on appearance),' to sex attacks or rape." However, the article does not mention "insistent flirting" or "whistling" as forms of harassment. The article only mentions "sex attacks or rape" as forms of harassment.
3. The summary states that "the problem meant that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men." However, the article does not mention the number of men who were afraid of being attacked on public transport.
4. The summary mentions that "often 'invisible' because unreported, these physical and verbal attacks limit 'the freedom of women, because they are often obligated to alter their daily lives.'" However, the article does not mention anything about the attacks being "invisible" or limiting the freedom of women.
5. The summary states that "women must be able to move about and occupy the public space without being placed in danger or threatened." However, the article does not mention anything about women needing to "occupy the public space."

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
