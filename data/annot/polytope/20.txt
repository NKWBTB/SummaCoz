     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that ICANN sent a letter to the FTC and Canada's office of consumer affairs to see if Vox Populi's actions were illegal. However, the article states that ICANN sent the letter to the FTC and Canada's office of consumer affairs to see if Vox Populi's actions were illegal, but only after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon, and eBay complained last month.
2. The summary mentions that ICANN initially approved of the ".sucks" top-level domain name, but is now backtracking. However, the article states that ICANN initially approved of the ".sucks" top-level domain name and is now seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company.
3. The summary states that Vox Populi began accepting registrations using ".sucks" on March 30, but the article states that Vox Populi began accepting registrations using ".sucks" on March 30 for trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants.
4. The summary mentions that Taylor Swift has had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from ".porn" and ".adult" domains, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. However, the article states that ICANN said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or misstates several key details, including the fact that ICANN only took action after an advisory panel complained, that Vox Populi began accepting registrations on March 30 for trademark holders and celebrities, and that ICANN is seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company.
