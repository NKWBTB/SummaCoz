Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary mentions that ICANN sent a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to determine if Vox Populi's actions are illegal. However, the article does not mention anything about ICANN sending a letter. Instead, the article states that ICANN is backtracking on its decision to approve the ".sucks" domain name after an advisory panel complained.
2. The summary states that ICANN could declare Vox Populi in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior if Canadian or U.S. regulators find its actions are illegal. However, the article does not mention anything about ICANN having the power to declare Vox Populi in breach of its contract or seeking to change the registry's behavior. Instead, the article states that ICANN is seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company.
3. The summary mentions that Vox Populi's actions are illegal, but the article does not explicitly state that. Instead, the article states that the advisory body representing major companies and industry groups called the ".sucks" domain name a "shakedown scheme" and "predatory."
4. The summary states that the threat of opening a ".sucks" site to the average consumer later is an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme. However, the article does not mention anything about the average consumer being threatened with a ".sucks" site. Instead, the article focuses on the fact that celebrities and companies are paying to have their names removed from the domain.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article does not mention ICANN sending a letter, Vox Populi's actions being illegal, or the average consumer being threatened with a ".sucks" site. Instead, the article focuses on the fact that celebrities and companies are paying to have their names removed from the domain, and the advisory body representing major companies and industry groups called the ".sucks" domain name a "shakedown scheme" and "predatory."
