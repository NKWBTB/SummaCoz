    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman was arrested after receiving medical attention, but the article states that she was arrested before receiving medical attention. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.

2. The summary states that the woman was found in a toilet, but the article states that the baby was found in a rubbish bin inside the ladies' toilet. This is a discrepancy in the location where the woman and the baby were found.

3. The summary does not mention that the woman had blood on her, but the article states that she was found with blood on her shirt. This is another inconsistency between the summary and the article.

4. The summary states that the woman was arrested and faces charges of neglect, but the article does not mention any charges being filed against her. This indicates that the summary is not accurate in regards to the legal consequences of the woman's actions.

5. The summary states that the baby was declared healthy after being checked over by doctors, but the article does not mention the baby's health status. This is another inconsistency between the summary and the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article in several key details, indicating that it is not an accurate representation of the events described in the article.
