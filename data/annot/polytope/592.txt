premier league rivals tottenham were keen on signing depay last summer but saw their Â£ 15million offer rebuffed by psv .
and now it appears united are in pole position to land the signature of the dutch giants ' no 7 - despite competition from some of europe 's biggest club 's including paris-saint germain .
` that was last summer .
now depay is worth more than that , ' psv technical director marcel brands said of tottenham 's bid nearly 12 months ago .
` it 's true there has been contact with manchester united and paris saint-germain and a third , big european club .
` but this time we are talking about bigger amounts of money . '
depay is enjoying a prolific season at the philips stadion where he has scored an emphatic 20 goals in 26 league games so far this season .

born in 1994 , depay started out at hometown club vv moordrecht - a dutch amateur side in south holland - at the age of six before joining sparta rotterdam three years later .
the son of a ghanaian father and dutch mother , depay moved to psv at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in september 2011 having impressed during a trial .
depay signed his first professional contract in june 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the dutch giants .
pacy , with neat close control , depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign .
adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot .
often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents .
however , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .
talent to one day match arjen robben ... and already better than a young cristiano ronaldo ?
while depay has been tipped to become as good as dutch star arjen robben by psv manager phillip cocu , one man believes the holland youngster could one day rival cristiano ronaldo .
ed van steijn , the man who scouted ronaldo for manchester united , believes depay is better than the real madrid star was at the same age .
speaking to dutch daily newspaper algemeen dagblad , van steijn said : ` if i compare him to a young cristiano ronaldo at the time , then depay has more strings to his bow .
` ronaldo did the same things wrong at manchester united as he did when he was 17 . '
meanwhile , former holland midfielder cocu said of depay : ` whether he can be as good as arjen robben ?
` they are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot .
and both always have the urge to learn .
` but memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . '
depay 's psv team-mate stijn schaars is also a fan and told helden online : ` he 's doing everything to reach the top .
` he has a body of a true athlete , power and flair .
i 'm not afraid of him losing his head .
i like him a lot . '
international star and world cup goalscorer
depay was handed his first oranje call-up by louis van gaal in 2013 and was selected for holland 's world cup squad a year later .
the energetic frontman scored the winning goal in holland 's 3-2 victory over australia , before coming off the bench to net against chile and help van gaal 's men seal top spot in group b.
having impressed in brazil , depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` best young player ' award but lost out to france midfielder paul pogba .

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

The given summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The summary mentions "Manchester United have made an official approach for William Carvalho," but the article does not mention anything about Carvalho.
2. The summary mentions "the 21-year-old" and "the Dutch giants" multiple times, but the article only mentions Memphis Depay, a 21-year-old Dutch player who plays for PSV Eindhoven.
3. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, which is primarily about Memphis Depay and his potential transfer to Manchester United.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The first line of the summary mentions "Manchester United have made an official approach for William Carvalho," but the article does not mention Carvalho at all. This is a clear indication that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The second line of the summary mentions "the 21-year-old," but the article only mentions Memphis Depay, who is also 21 years old. This is a minor inconsistency, but it suggests that the summary is not accurately reflecting the content of the article.
3. The third line of the summary mentions "the Dutch giants," but the article only mentions PSV Eindhoven, which is a Dutch club. This is another minor inconsistency that suggests the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The final line of the summary mentions "the 21-year-old," again, but this time in conjunction with "the Dutch giants." This is a repetition of the previous inconsistency and further suggests that the summary is not accurately reflecting the content of the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions William Carvalho, who is not mentioned in the article, and it uses phrases that are not accurately reflective of the content of the article.
