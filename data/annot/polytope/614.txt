     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the favorite name for a girl is Diana, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Alice and Charlotte are the second and third favorite names for a girl, respectively.
2. The summary states that the poll revealed that Diana is the favorite name for a girl, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the poll revealed that 12% of people think the child should be named after William's mother, Diana, but it does not specify that Diana is the favorite name.
3. The summary states that the public is hoping for a baby princess, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the public is divided on whether they want a boy or a girl.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the importance of Diana as a potential name for the royal baby and misrepresents the public's preferences for the baby's gender.
