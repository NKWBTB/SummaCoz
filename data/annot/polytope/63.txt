Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. "Sleepy head" is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about the boy being sleepy or trying to get rest. Instead, it describes the boy chasing the cat around the garden.
2. "Perfect pillow" is inconsistent with the article because the cat is not used as a pillow in the article. The article states that the cat scurries away after being plonked on top by the boy.
3. "Not amused" is inconsistent with the article because the cat does not seem to be amused or upset by the boy's actions. In fact, the article states that the cat immediately gets up and scurries away after being plonked on top.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events described in the article. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article.
