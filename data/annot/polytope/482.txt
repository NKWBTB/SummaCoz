    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary states that the woman, Yuan Yen, was found to have blood on her when she was approached, but the article does not mention this. Additionally, the summary states that Yuan Yen was in a trance, but the article does not mention this either.

Step 2: Analyze the article

The article states that staff at the restaurant heard the baby girl crying in the ladies' toilet and found her wrapped in a shirt and still attached to the umbilical cord and placenta. The workers called the police and ambulance, and the woman who had been seen visiting the toilet was established to be the mother and was arrested. The article does not mention anything about Yuan Yen having blood on her or being in a trance.

Step 3: Identify the reasons for the inconsistencies

The inconsistencies in the summary are likely due to the fact that the article does not provide information about Yuan Yen's physical state or her behavior after she was found. The article focuses primarily on the discovery of the baby and the arrest of the mother, without providing details about Yuan Yen's personal condition.

Step 4: Conclude

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not supported by the text. Specifically, the statements about Yuan Yen having blood on her and being in a trance are not present in the article.
