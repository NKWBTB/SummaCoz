</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the woman, Yuan Yen, was found to have blood on her when she was approached. However, the article states that she had blood on her shirt, not on her person.
2. The summary states that the woman was found in the ladies' toilet, but the article states that she was found in the bin inside the toilet.
3. The summary does not mention that the woman was arrested, nor does it mention that she was taken to the hospital for medical attention.
4. The summary states that the woman was found to have blood on her, but the article does not mention any injuries or blood on her person.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important details, such as the woman's arrest and medical attention, and includes inaccurate information, such as the location of the woman's discovery and the presence of blood on her person.
