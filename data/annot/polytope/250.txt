    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps to explain why:

1. The summary states that the empty pool was used as a catwalk setting for the ten pieces presentation, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the pool was drained, and the catwalk was set up along the break wall.
2. The summary mentions that the collection is designed to be worn in 20 ways, but the article only mentions that the collection is suitable for day to night wear and does not provide a specific number of ways to wear the clothes.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the show was held during an unseasonably warm day with beautiful blue sky and sunshine, as mentioned in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the brand's name, Mono, or the fact that the collection is a capsule collection of ten pieces, as mentioned in the article.
5. The summary does not mention the location of the show, Bondi's Icebergs Club, or the fact that the show was part of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, as mentioned in the article.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
