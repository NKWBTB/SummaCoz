</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the empty pool was used as the catwalk setting for the ten pieces presentation, implying that the pool was empty throughout the show. However, the article states that the pool was filled with water for the show, and that models paraded through the empty pool and along the break wall.
2. The summary does not mention the unique location of the show, which was the iconic Icebergs Club pool at Bondi Beach. The article highlights the location as one of the key aspects of the show.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the collection was designed to be worn in 20 different ways, and that the pieces were unisex. These details are prominent in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the minimalist and androgynous designs of the collection, which were a key feature of the show.
5. The summary does not mention the nibbles and drinks served at the show, which were provided by Icebergs and Santa Vittoria.
6. The summary does not mention the beautiful blue sky and sunshine that accompanied the show, which was an unseasonably warm 28 degrees Celsius day.

Overall, the summary does not provide an accurate representation of the article. It omits several key details and does not convey the unique and interesting aspects of the show.
