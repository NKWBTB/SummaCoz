Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

The given summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The summary mentions only denim wide-leg trousers, while the article discusses various fabrics and styles, including printed, cropped, and high-waisted trousers.
2. The summary states that the trend made an appearance on several catwalks, but the article does not mention any specific catwalks or designers.
3. The summary mentions only three brands - Gucci, Topshop, and Celine - while the article mentions several other brands and designers.

To fix the summary, it should be rewritten to include the variety of fabrics and styles discussed in the article, and to remove the mention of specific catwalks and brands. Here's a revised summary:

The wide-leg trouser is a key spring trend this season, with a variety of styles and fabrics available. From denim to printed and cropped, there's a wide-leg trouser to suit every style. The trend has been seen on the runways of top designers, and is being embraced by fashion influencers and bloggers.
