    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the couple was not alerted of the photos until many months after the celebration, but the article states that the bride's sister told the family about the racist incident at the photo booth after the wedding.

2. The summary states that James Evans allegedly did not apologize for the racial slur and told the couple to " sue him," but the article states that Evans denied all allegations and claimed that there is no evidence linking the company to the offensive caption.

3. The summary states that the couple hired attorney Cathy Hale to sue James Evans and Premiere Photos, but the article states that Hale said her clients did not want to file a lawsuit but finally decided to press charges after Evans did nothing about the racist comments.

4. The summary states that the couple wants an apology at the very least, but the article states that Evans denied all allegations and Hale disagrees with Evans' claims.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides more detailed and accurate information about the incident and the parties involved.
