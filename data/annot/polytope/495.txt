this is the moment an aeroplane touched down on a runway without deploying its landing gear and skidded along the runway on its belly . captured in fort pierce , florida , the shocking footage shows the light general aviation aircraft approaching the aero acres residential airpark . despite the fact the aerostar plane travels at speed , its descent towards the landing strip appears normal until the video maker makes a startling observation . the light general aviation aircraft approaches the aero acres residential airpark and touches down without its landing gear deployed . he states that the landing gear has not been deployed and at that very moment the plane touches down with a bump and scratches along the tarmac . its propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact . suddenly the pilot re-engages the engines and rather unceremoniously takes off back into the air . the plane 's propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact . the video maker can be heard saying that the plane’s propellers have been damaged in the collision with the runway and that more than likely , the pilot will crash . he later said : ‘ i was walking down the flight line of aircraft that flew in for the day , which is close to the main runway and noticed this light twin aircraft coming in low . ‘ i noticed he did not have his landing gear down and thought he was going to do a fly-by , but then noticed the power was pulled back with the aircraft approaching for a landing with no landing gear . the plane scratches along the runway and the video maker describes the sound as ' one you will not forget ' . ‘ the belly and tips of the propellers impacted the runway ( the sound of the propellers hitting the surface was one sound you will not forget ) . ‘ once the pilot realized his mistake , he gave what appeared to be full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down with the propellers making a second impact with the runway . ‘ somehow the engines stayed on and running and the pilot was able to regain control while leaving the airport . the video maker noted that once the pilot realized his mistake he began re-engaging the engine . he added : ‘it’s amazing the aeroplane engines did not get destroyed during the propellers impact and the pilot did not stall during the forced take-off with the high angle of attack and damaged propellers . ’ according to wpbf 25 news , the plane’s pilot , chris georgaklis , 85 , managed to fly 100 miles to fort lauderdale after the incident and landed safely . mr georgaklis is said to have flown for almost 50 years and was accompanied on the trip by his dog , buddy . people look on as the damaged aircraft takes off from the runway and flies 100 miles to fort lauderdale , where it landed safely . the most common cause of a gear-up landing , also known as a belly landing or pancake landing , is human error – when the pilot simply forgets to deploy the landing gear before touchdown . another cause is mechanical fault , when an electric motor or a hydraulic actuator fails . the faa is said to be investigating the incident .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Descent appears normal: The summary states that the plane's descent appears normal, but the article states that the pilot failed to deploy the landing gear before touchdown.
2. Plane touches down with a bump and scratches: The summary mentions that the plane touches down with a bump and scratches, but the article does not mention any damage to the plane's underside.
3. Pilot re-engages the engines: The summary does not mention the pilot re-engaging the engines, but the article states that the pilot gave full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down.
4. Plane takes off from the runway: The summary does not mention the plane taking off from the runway, but the article states that the plane managed to take off from the runway and fly 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary appears to be a brief summary of the article, but it does not accurately capture the events described in the article. The article provides more detailed information about the incident, including the pilot's failure to deploy the landing gear, the plane's damaged propellers, and the pilot's ability to regain control and safely land the plane in Fort Lauderdale.
