However, the article states that the piglet was born with all four legs, but the back legs were missing.

2. The summary states that the piglet has mastered the art of balancing on its front trotters.

The article states that the piglet has to use extraordinary balance to stand on its front trotters.

3. The summary does not mention that the piglet has to use extraordinary balance to stand on its front trotters.

4. The summary states that the piglet takes unsteady steps and wobbles about with its snout to the ground in the hunt for food.

The article states that the piglet happily mixes with the rest of the litter, which have all been born with a full complement of legs, and looks for food by keeping its snout to the ground.

5. The summary does not mention that the piglet has siblings who have all been born with a full complement of legs.

The article states that the piglet has become an internet sensation because of a cute video showing it learning to walk.

7. The summary does not mention that the piglet has been named "super pig."
