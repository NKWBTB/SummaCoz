    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify the inconsistencies in the summary. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The summary states that the piglet was born with its back legs missing, but the article does not mention anything about the piglet being born without back legs. Instead, the article states that the piglet was born with its back legs missing, but it does not specify how the piglet was born.
2. The summary states that the piglet has mastered the art of balancing on its front trotters, but the article does not mention anything about the piglet being able to balance on its front trotters. Instead, the article states that the piglet is learning to walk on its front legs.
3. The summary states that the piglet takes unsteady steps and wobbles about with its snout to the ground in the hunt for food, but the article does not mention anything about the piglet taking unsteady steps or wobbling about. Instead, the article states that the piglet is learning to walk on its front legs and is using its snout to search for food.
4. The summary states that the piglet has become an internet sensation because of a cute video showing it learning to walk, but the article does not mention anything about a video showing the piglet learning to walk. Instead, the article states that the piglet has become an internet sensation because of its unique ability to walk on its front legs.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary exaggerates the piglet's abilities and includes information that is not present in the article.
