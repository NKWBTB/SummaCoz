    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the teacher wanted the boy to "slowly bleed to death" before she "finished him," but the article does not mention anything about the teacher wanting the boy to bleed to death. Instead, the article states that the teacher wanted the boy to be tortured and killed.
2. The summary mentions that the teacher asked the hitman to break the boy's arms and legs, but the article does not mention anything about the teacher asking the hitman to break the boy's arms and legs. Instead, the article states that the teacher wanted the boy to be tortured and killed.
3. The summary states that the teacher wanted the boy to suffer unbearable pain, but the article does not mention anything about the teacher wanting the boy to suffer unbearable pain. Instead, the article states that the teacher wanted the boy to be tortured and killed.
4. The summary mentions that the teacher was arrested after handing over expense money, but the article does not mention anything about the teacher being arrested after handing over expense money. Instead, the article states that the teacher was arrested after she had handed over some expenses money to the "killer."

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the teacher's desire for the boy to suffer and emphasizes the idea of slow bleeding, which is not present in the article. Additionally, the summary mentions the teacher being arrested after handing over expense money, which is not mentioned in the article.
