    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott posed for a Lanvin photoshoot alongside his Arsenal teammates, while the article only mentions a photoshoot with Walcott and his teammates, without mentioning Lanvin.
2. The summary mentions Olga Sherer, a runway model, as being in the photoshoot, while the article does not mention her.
3. The summary states that the photoshoot was for Lanvin, but the article only mentions that the team will be dressed in similar attire for the FA Cup final, without mentioning Lanvin.
4. The summary states that Walcott has spent much of the season on the bench, which is supported by the article, but the article also mentions that he came on for the last six minutes of the game against Chelsea.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article (Olga Sherer and Lanvin) and omits other details that are present in the article (Walcott coming on for the last six minutes of the game against Chelsea).
