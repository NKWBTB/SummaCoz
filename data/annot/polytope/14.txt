Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott has spent much of the season on the bench, which is true. However, the article provides more information about Walcott's season, including the fact that he has been named on the substitutes' bench for 17 of Arsenal's 33 Premier League games. This additional information is not included in the summary.
2. The summary mentions that Walcott came on for the last six minutes of Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea on Sunday, which is accurate. However, the article provides more context about this, stating that Walcott came on for the last six minutes of the game after being named on the bench. The summary does not include this context.
3. The summary states that Walcott will be hoping to make his first Arsenal start since the side's 3-0 win over West Ham on March 14, which is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Walcott has not started many games for Arsenal this season, the article does not mention any specific game or start date.

Therefore, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article because it does not include all of the information provided in the article and omits some context.
