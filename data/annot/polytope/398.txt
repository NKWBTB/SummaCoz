    Article: 
    jerusalem ( cnn ) a palestinian teenager 's name will be removed from an israeli memorial commemorating fallen soldiers and the victims of terrorism after his family and others complained .
mohammed abu khdeir 's name appeared this week on the wall at jerusalem 's mount herzl , the site of the national cemetery , as the nation prepared to mark its memorial day on wednesday .
abu khdeir , 16 , was beaten and burned alive by three israelis in july , according to prosecutors .
a picture on the memorial website for abu khdeir shows an israeli flag with two flowers called " blood of the maccabees " in israel , a symbol often used on memorial day , when the country honors its soldiers killed in the line of duty and victims of terrorism .
but abu khdeir 's family objected to his inclusion on the memorial wall .
his father , hussein abu khdeir , said no one asked for his permission to put his son 's name on the wall .
" i refuse that my son 's name will be listed between soldiers of the occupation , " he said .
almagor , an organization that works on behalf of victims of terror in israel , also opposes abu khdeir 's inclusion on the memorial .
almagor described the teen 's death as a rogue attack and said he 's not a terror victim .
" somebody did here a trick , and we are going to fight to correct it , " said almagor ceo meir indor .
" we will not recognize someone who was murdered in a brutal way in an individual action . "
indor 's organization wrote a letter to the national insurance institute of israel -- the country 's social security administration , which maintains the memorial site -- demanding that abu khdeir 's name be removed from the memorial wall .
indor said if the teenager 's name is not taken off , members of almagor want their own family members ' names removed .
on wednesday , israel radio reported that the national insurance institute of israel will remove abu khdeir 's name from the memorial following his father 's complaints .
the teen 's name has already been removed from the organization 's website , which lists the names on the memorial wall .
a panel of judges began hearing evidence in january against the three suspects in abu khdeir 's killing . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Mohammed Abu Khdeir's name was included on the memorial wall at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl, along with the names of fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism.
2. However, the article also states that Abu Khdeir's family and others have complained about his inclusion on the memorial wall, and that his name will be removed following his father's complaints.
3. The article notes that Abu Khdeir was beaten and burned alive by three Israelis in July, according to prosecutors.
4. The summary states that Abu Khdeir's name will be removed from the memorial wall, but the article does not mention any reason for the removal.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information as the article. The summary states that Abu Khdeir's name will be removed, but the article does not provide a reason for the removal.
6. The article provides a reason for the removal of Abu Khdeir's name, which is that his family and others have complained about his inclusion on the memorial wall. This reason is not mentioned in the summary.
7. Therefore, the summary is not a accurate representation of the information provided in the article. It does not provide all the information in the article and does not accurately represent the reason for the removal of Abu Khdeir's name from the memorial wall.
