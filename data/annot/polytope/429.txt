as healer mangu ram rests with a threadbare blanket over his creaking knees , the 82-year-old looks to the future .
it is almost 70 years since he fled the violence that followed the partition of india , and he is still regarded as a second class citizen in indian kashmir -- unable to own property or vote in state elections .
but now ram and thousands like him are daring to hope they will finally be able to shed the refugee status that has plagued them for decades , after prime minister narendra modi 's hindu nationalist party won a share of power in india 's only muslim-majority state .
mangu ram was 14 when he fled to kashmir as a refugee - now an old man , for the past 70 years he has been denied citizenship rights
a hindu , traditional healer ram lives a slum house within india 's only muslim-majority state .
its rulers have refused to give the west pakistan refugees ( wprs ) the right to own property or vote in state elections - meaning three generations are caught in abject poverty
` if something can be done , then maybe i will finally have some enjoyment in this life , ' the traditional healer said from his slum home on the outskirts of jammu , kashmir 's winter capital .
` if only the gods could show us some mercy . '
ram , a hindu , was born in an area of punjab province , part of modern-day pakistan but within india 's boundaries before the country became independent in 1947 .
hundreds of thousands of families fled across both sides of the border during the conflict which led to the partition of the sub-continent .
around one million people were killed in the bloody war between the two countries
ram , aged 82 , with the success of prime minister narendra modi 's hindu nationalist party at a recent state vote , he says he is hopeful change will come for the west pakistan refugees : ` if something can be done , then maybe i will finally have some enjoyment in this life '
around 100,000 people are classified as refugees - despite most of them never visiting pakistan , and living in the jammu region of india
most of those refugees were quickly absorbed in towns and cities of the newly-independent nations .
however the fate of the west pakistan refugees ( wprs ) like ram who decamped to jammu and kashmir state became mired in the dispute with pakistan over the territory .
because of this , its rulers held off granting the refugees residential rights , including the right to buy land , vote in state polls or work in the state government .
observers say the reluctance of successive state governments to grant full rights to the overwhelmingly hindu wprs stems from fears of upsetting the demographic balance in india 's only muslim-majority state , which has special autonomy enshrined in the constitution .

the area has evolved into one of the many slum settlements in hind-dominated areas of the city region of jammu , within india 's only muslim-majority state
generations of families have become stuck in poverty because of their continuing refugee status .
successive governments have failed to act to due , say commentators , to a fear of upsetting the demographic balance of the state between the muslim and hindu populations
the wprs , whose families mainly originate from punjab , have fallen foul of a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to people born - or descendants of those born - in the old undivided kingdom of kashmir .
the same legislation has allowed around 35,000 hindus who have fled pakistan-controlled kashmir since partition to be granted citizenship .
there are around 100,000 people classified as wprs , most living in the jammu region .
hardly any of them have ever set foot in pakistan .

with a hindu nationalist party winning a share of power in kashmir , there is hope .
bharatiya janata party are expected to champion the refugees ' cause .
but a veteran activist labha ram ghandi warned the community is not afraid to take matters into their own hands
suspected rebels shot dead three unarmed policemen monday in the disputed himalayan region of kashmir .
the three policemen were investigating a dispute between neighbours when they were fired on by at least three militants wearing army uniforms , officials said .
in a separate attack , another officer was critically wounded after suspected militants shot at him inside a bus near northern pattan town , police said .
no rebel group immediately claimed responsibility for either attack .
kashmir has been in conflict for decades , with rebels fighting either for independence or a merger with neighboring pakistan , which also claims the territory in its entirety while administering part of it .
and despite prevailing unrest from different factions , who either fight for independence or to merge once again with pakistan , kashmir is one of india 's more prosperous states .
yet the estimated 18,000 wpr families however live in abject poverty , mostly marrying among themselves because of their low economic status .
` i spend whatever money i earn to send my children to school , " said ramesh kumar , a part-time driver who lives with his wife , two children and mother in a two-room hovel .
he says he thinks the law is ` ridiculous ' , adding : ` i was born here ( in india ) .
what else do i and my children need to be citizens of this place ? '
as things stand , kumar 's children can not be admitted to state-run training colleges or be employed in the state government , although they can work for the federal one .
but the tide may soon turn on the rights given to refugees , after a pledge by the newly-elected bharatiya janata party to normalise the wprs ' status .
although the bjp came second in the december hustings , they have joined a kashmir governing coalition for the first time and are expected to champion the wprs ' cause .
` we have been living here like this for three generations now , ' said veteran activist labha ram gandhi .
` granting us state-subject rights is the only way to improve our condition . '
but he warned the community is ready to take matters into their own hands if their hopes are dashed again .
` we will spill our blood on the streets for our rights , ' he says .
the daughter of a hindu refugee studies in her slum home in surej chak .
under the current laws she is not allowed to enrolled at a state-run training college or be employed by the state government .
such laws , argue opponents , make these families ` second class citizens '

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Mangu Ram was a refugee when he fled to Kashmir as a 14-year-old, and now, as an old man, he is hoping for change after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party won a share of power in India's state elections.
2. However, the article states that Mangu Ram is not a refugee, but a traditional healer who lives in a slum in Jammu, Kashmir. He has been denied citizenship rights for 70 years and is considered a second-class citizen.
3. The summary does not mention that Mangu Ram is a Hindu, while the article highlights that he is a Hindu and that the West Pakistan refugees, like him, have been denied citizenship rights.
4. The summary does not mention the conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, which is a significant aspect of the article.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that the West Pakistan refugees have been denied residential rights, including the right to buy land, vote in state polls, or work in the state government.
6. The summary does not mention the activist Labha Ram Gandhi, who is quoted in the article as saying that granting the refugees state-subject rights is the only way to improve their condition.
7. The summary does not mention the fact that the article is discussing the plight of around 100,000 West Pakistan refugees who have been living in poverty for decades.

In conclusion, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It does not provide a clear picture of the issues faced by the West Pakistan refugees, such as their denied citizenship rights, poverty, and lack of access to education and government jobs. Additionally, the summary does not mention the conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, which is a significant aspect of the article.
