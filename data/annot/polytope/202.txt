    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets to progress to the semi-finals, while the article states that Williams beat Lisicki in a tight match that went to three sets.
2. The summary incorrectly states that Williams will face Simona Halep for a place in the final, while the article states that Halep beat Sloane Stephens to reach the semi-finals.
3. The summary mentions Andy Murray and his 500th win, but there is no mention of this in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions.
