    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the explosion occurred at an oil storage facility, but the article states that the explosion occurred at a controversial chemical plant that produces paraxylene (PX). The two are not the same.

2. The summary does not mention that the plant produces a reportedly carcinogenic chemical, which is a significant detail that is included in the article.

3. The summary states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, but the article does not mention any injuries or casualties.

4. The summary mentions that the fire is now under control, but the article does not mention any fire.

5. The summary mentions that the plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, but the article does not mention any previous explosions.

6. The summary does not mention any protests or controversy surrounding the plant's construction, which is a significant detail that is included in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits several key details and includes some inaccuracies.
