Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the explosion occurred at an oil storage facility, but the article does not mention anything about an oil storage facility. Instead, the article states that the explosion occurred at a chemical plant that produces paraxylene (PX).
2. The summary claims that six people were injured, but the article only mentions five people being injured.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the cause of the explosion, while the article states that the explosion was caused by an oil leak.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the plant being located in Zhangzhou city, while the article provides this information.
5. The summary does not mention anything about the plant producing PX, while the article states that the plant produces this chemical.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
