    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Steven Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article focuses on Gerrard's impact on Martin Skrtel and Liverpool's potential to replace him.
2. The summary mentions that Liverpool can overcome the difficult challenge of replacing Gerrard, but the article does not address this point directly. Instead, the article focuses on Skrtel's praise for Gerrard and the potential for other players to fill his void.
3. The summary states that Skrtel believes Liverpool will be a different side without Gerrard, but the article does not quote Skrtel as saying this. Instead, the article quotes Skrtel as saying that Liverpool have the players to fill Gerrard's void, provided they are given the right help.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it emphasizes different points and takes a more positive tone on Liverpool's ability to replace Gerrard. The article, on the other hand, focuses on Skrtel's praise for Gerrard and the potential challenges facing Liverpool in replacing such an iconic player.
