Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article states that Gerrard is set to feature in the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa, but it does not make any claims about his current abilities or ranking among the best players in the world.
2. The summary suggests that Liverpool can fill Gerrard's void, but the article does not provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, the article quotes Martin Skrtel as saying that Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world and that Liverpool will be a different side without him, which implies that the team will miss his presence.
3. The summary mentions Skrtel's praise for Gerrard, but the article does not provide any quotes from Skrtel about Gerrard being one of the best players in the world. In fact, the article only quotes Skrtel as saying that Gerrard helped him settle at the club and that he is still one of the best players in the world, but this is not the same as saying that Liverpool can fill his void.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes claims that are not supported by the text. Specifically, the summary states that Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, which is not mentioned in the article, and it suggests that Liverpool can fill his void, which is not supported by the article's quotes from Skrtel.
