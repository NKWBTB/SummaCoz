     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Steven Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, but the article does not support this claim. While the article mentions that Gerrard is still a top player, it also notes that he is 34 years old and will be leaving Liverpool after this season.
2. The summary states that Liverpool can fill Gerrard's void, but the article suggests that the club will be different without him. The article quotes Martin Skrtel as saying that Gerrard is synonymous with Liverpool and that the club will never be the same without him.
3. The summary states that Skrtel believes Liverpool can overcome the difficult challenge of replacing Gerrard, but the article quotes Skrtel as saying that the club has potential replacements for Gerrard, but they will need the right help.

Overall, the summary presents a more positive and confident view of Liverpool's ability to replace Gerrard than the article does. The article emphasizes the difficulty of replacing such an iconic player and notes that the club will be different without him.
