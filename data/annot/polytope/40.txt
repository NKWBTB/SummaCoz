    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that West Ham are discussing a deal for Deshane Beckford after he impressed on trial, but the summary claims that West Ham are closing in on his signature. This is inconsistent as the article does not mention any agreement or closing in on a deal.
2. The summary states that season tickets at the Olympic Stadium will cost as little as £289, but the article does not mention anything about season tickets or prices.
3. The summary mentions that Deshane Beckford is a Jamaican starlet, but the article does not provide any information about his nationality.
4. The summary states that Beckford has impressed coaches after spending two weeks with the club, but the article only mentions that he impressed coaches during his trial period.
5. The summary mentions that Beckford has offers from clubs in Belgium, but the article does not mention anything about other clubs interested in signing him.
6. The summary states that West Ham will have the cheapest pricing strategy in the Barclays Premier League, but the article does not mention anything about pricing strategies or the cost of season tickets.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
