Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the sailboat was falsely flying an American flag in the Caribbean.

2. The summary does not mention this detail.

3. The article states that the French customs officers seized more than 2 tons of cocaine, with an estimated value of over $105 million.

4. The summary only mentions "more than 2 tons" of cocaine, without specifying the exact amount or the estimated value.

5. The article states that three individuals, one Venezuelan and two Spanish citizens, were arrested.

6. The summary only mentions "one venezuelan" being arrested.

7. The article provides additional information about the seizure, including the location (off the coast of Martinique) and the fact that it is the biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities.

8. The summary does not include this additional information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits several key details, including the fact that the sailboat was flying a false flag, the exact amount and estimated value of the cocaine, and the fact that three individuals were arrested.
