</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott has been pictured on a different kind of bench with his teammates for a photoshoot with Lanvin, the club's official tailor since 2013.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a photoshoot or a bench. Instead, it talks about Walcott sitting on the bench during Arsenal's matches and being overlooked for the majority of the season.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a photoshoot and a bench, which are not present in the article.
4. The article only mentions Walcott sitting on the bench and being overlooked for the majority of the season, but the summary adds additional information that is not supported by the article.
5. The inconsistency is likely due to the fact that the summary is trying to highlight Walcott's appearance in the photoshoot, but the article does not provide any information about that.
