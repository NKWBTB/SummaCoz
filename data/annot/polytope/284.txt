    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that. Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that Theo Walcott was pictured for a photoshoot with his teammates, but the article does not mention any photoshoot.
2. The summary states that Walcott has been overlooked for the majority of the season, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that Walcott has been named on the substitutes' bench for 17 of Arsenal's 33 Premier League games, but it does not suggest that he has been overlooked.
3. The summary mentions that Walcott came on for the last six minutes of Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that Walcott will be hoping to make his first Arsenal start since their 3-0 win over West Ham on March 14, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article, such as the photoshoot and Walcott's supposed overlooked status. The article focuses on Walcott's limited playing time and his recent appearance on the bench for Arsenal's match against Chelsea.
