Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott is the club's official tailor since 2013. This is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of Walcott being the club's tailor.
2. The summary states that Arsenal's first team stars will be dressed in similar outfits. This is not entirely accurate, as the article only mentions that the players will be dressed in similar attire for the FA Cup final.
3. The summary states that Walcott has been overlooked for the majority of the season. This is supported by the article, which states that Walcott has been named on the substitutes' bench for 17 of Arsenal's 33 Premier League games.

Overall, the summary contains some inaccuracies and exaggerations. Specifically, it falsely states that Walcott is the club's official tailor and that the first team stars will be dressed in similar outfits for all games, rather than just the FA Cup final.
