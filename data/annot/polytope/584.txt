    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott is Arsenal's official tailor since 2013, but the article does not mention anything about Walcott being a tailor or having any involvement in fashion.
2. The summary mentions that Arsenal's first team stars will be dressed in similar attire, but the article does not mention anything about the team wearing similar attire. In fact, the article mentions that Walcott and his teammates posed for a photoshoot with the fashion house Lanvin, which suggests that they may be wearing different outfits.
3. The summary states that Walcott has been overlooked for the majority of the season, but the article actually states that he has been named on the substitutes' bench for 17 of Arsenal's 33 Premier League games, which suggests that he has been involved in the team but not as a starter.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, Walcott is not the official tailor of Arsenal, and the team is not wearing similar attire. Additionally, the summary overstates Walcott's lack of involvement in the team by suggesting that he has been overlooked for the majority of the season, when in fact he has been involved in the team as a substitute.
