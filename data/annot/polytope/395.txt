    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics, but the article does not mention PX. Instead, the article states that the plant produces "a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics." This discrepancy suggests that the summary may not accurately represent the content of the article.
2. The summary states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass and were sent to the hospital for treatment, but the article does not mention any injuries or casualties. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not accurately represent the content of the article.
3. The summary states that the plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, but the article does not mention any previous explosions. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not accurately represent the content of the article.
4. The summary states that the plant was slated for Xiamen, a densely populated city in the southeast of the country, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the plant is located in Zhangzhou City. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not accurately represent the content of the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, suggesting that it may not accurately represent the content of the article.
