Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the plant produces paraxylene (px), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical, but the article does not mention anything about the plant producing px. The article only mentions that the plant produces oil.
2. The summary states that the blast occurred at an oil storage facility, but the article does not mention anything about an oil storage facility. The article only mentions that the blast occurred at the plant.
3. The summary states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, but the article does not mention anything about injuries or broken glass.
4. The summary states that more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze, but the article does not mention anything about the number of firefighters sent to fight the fire.
5. The summary states that the plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, but the article does not mention anything about previous explosions.
6. The summary does not mention anything about the plant being located in a densely populated area or about the local government relocating the factory to a more remote location, which are both mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. It contains several inaccuracies and omissions, and it does not provide a accurate summary of the article's content.
