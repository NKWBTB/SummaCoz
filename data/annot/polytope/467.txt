Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Russia beat Lisicki 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-3.
2. The article states that Pavlyuchenkova beat Lisicki 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-3.
3. The summary does not mention Svetlana Kuznetsova's victory in the opening rubber, while the article does.
4. The summary states that Russia are on the Fed Cup final with a 2-0 lead after Svetlana Lisicki, which is incorrect as the correct name is Svetlana Kuznetsova, not Lisicki.
5. The summary does not mention the double faults and unforced errors committed by both players, which are mentioned in the article.
6. The summary does not accurately reflect the match point saved by Pavlyuchenkova, as the article states that she saved a match point in the second set before going on to beat Lisicki.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the errors can be explained as follows:

* The summary does not accurately reflect the scores of the matches.
* The summary does not mention all the information in the article, such as Kuznetsova's victory and the double faults and unforced errors committed by both players.
* The summary contains incorrect information, such as the name of the player who won the opening rubber (it should be Kuznetsova, not Lisicki).
