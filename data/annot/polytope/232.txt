     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the university decided to proceed with the screening despite objections from some students, but the article states that the university initially canceled the screening due to objections from some students.
2. The summary mentions that some students believed the movie's depiction of the Iraq war reflected negatively on the Middle East and people from that region, but the article does not mention this as a reason for the cancellation.
3. The summary states that a counter-petition asked school officials to reconsider the decision to cancel the movie, but the article does not mention a counter-petition.
4. The summary mentions that the university's vice president for student life said that it was a mistake to cancel the movie and that the show will go on, but the article does not include this quote.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details and includes inaccurate information.
