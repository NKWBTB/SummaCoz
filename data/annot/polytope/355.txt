</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

The provided summary is not consistent with the article because it leaves out several important details and misrepresents some of the information in the article. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the issues:

1. The summary states that "chelsea have made an offer for muto according to fc tokyo president naoki ogane." However, the article does not mention any offer from Chelsea. Instead, it reports that Ogane claimed that Chelsea have made an offer, but the article does not confirm whether this offer actually exists.
2. The summary states that Chelsea would loan Muto to partner club Vitesse Arnhem next season. However, the article does not mention anything about a loan. Instead, it reports that Muto is considering a move to Chelsea, but it does not specify whether he would be loaned out or signed permanently.
3. The summary states that Muto is keen to join a club where he will play regularly and realize his potential. However, the article does not mention anything about Muto's desire to play regularly. Instead, it reports that Muto is considering a move to Chelsea because he wants to "think about it carefully" and "take his time."
4. The summary misrepresents the quote from FC Tokyo boss Ranko Popovic. The article quotes Popovic as saying that Muto is "something like a noble" and has "something different to all other players." However, the summary simplifies this quote to "Popovic said Muto is a 'different guy'."
5. The summary leaves out several important details from the article, such as Chelsea's £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama Rubber, and Jose Mourinho's comments about Muto.

Overall, the summary is not a faithful representation of the article and leaves out several important details. It also misrepresents some of the information in the article and oversimplifies other parts.
