    Article: 
    congratulations to australia for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas .
it leaves england looking old-fashioned and they need to react .
stuart lancaster must be free to pick his best players , no matter where in the world they ply their trade .
if roy hodgson 's star names moved to bayern munich or barcelona , would the fa tell him not to pick them ?
the same needs to apply to rugby .
matt giteau 's stellar displays for toulon have put him back on the wallabies radar ahead of the world cup
the game is changing and australia have realised that .
matt giteau and drew mitchell , for example , are top-class performers for toulon and if england lose to australia with those two playing out of their skins , you know exactly what the headlines will be .
the world cup is simply about the world 's best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it .
toulon 's steffon armitage came off the bench against leinster on sunday and turned the game on its head .
his turnover work and ball-carrying are second to none and since he upped sticks to france his game has constantly improved .
toulon 's steffon armitage takes on the leinster defence during the champions cup semi-final in marseille
i do n't think armitage would be playing this well if he was still at london irish .
he took a big risk and it paid off , he should n't be penalised for it .
if one or two england back-rowers would n't want to see armitage in the squad , then that confirms he should be !
nick abendanon has also become better since he crossed the channel .
it 's simply wrong to say england are best served by players at english clubs .
if someone is going to be happier , healthier and a better player overseas , he should be supported .
jonny wilkinson moved to france and became even better than when he played for england , so that completes the argument for me .
would i have picked jonny if he was playing in france ?
nick abendanon 's game has drastically improved since the former bath full back made the move to france
as england coach you will be judged on your world cup performance , even more so as the home team .
that 's where you have to deliver the results and selecting your best starting xv is the first thing you have to get right , without exception .
when it comes to the big games , the other england players will want to have the best possible squad available .
every player , fan and englishman wants england to win the world cup and it starts with picking your best team .
when it comes to a home world cup , you do n't want to be left talking about ` what ifs ' .
england head coach stuart lancaster has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players
england players deserve to go on to the field knowing they have been given the best chance of winning .
do the squad truly believe this when such talented players are not considered ?
they should n't be left to doubt they are playing only because of their home address .
this is n't about being disloyal to the clubs .
they benefit from a winning england team , especially in a world cup year .
you simply ca n't let the rfu or premier rugby tie your hands behind your back and dictate who you can or ca n't pick .
at toulon , they 've got bryan habana playing for south africa and leigh halfpenny playing for wales .
they 're among the best players in the world .
it 's just crazy and misguided not to make any englishman available for selection .
bryan habana plays for toulon but the springboks have continued to select the winger for test matches

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that England head coach Stuart Lancaster has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players, while the article argues that Australia has dropped its ridiculous policy of not selecting its best players if they are playing overseas. This implies that the summary is not consistent with the article's stance on the issue.
2. The summary mentions that Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell are top-class performers for Toulon, but the article does not mention anything about these players being overseas-based. This suggests that the summary is not accurately representing the content of the article.
3. The summary states that Steffon Armitage has improved since moving to Toulon, and that he should be in the England squad. However, the article does not mention Armitage at all. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content.
4. The summary argues that england should select its best players, regardless of where they play, while the article argues that Australia has realized that and has dropped its policy of not selecting overseas players. This implies that the summary is not consistent with the article's stance on the issue.
5. The summary mentions that Jonny Wilkinson moved to France and became even better, which is not mentioned in the article. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content.

Overall, the given summary is not consistent with the article's content, as it misrepresents the article's stance on selecting overseas players, mentions players who are not mentioned in the article, and includes inconsistencies in the argument.
