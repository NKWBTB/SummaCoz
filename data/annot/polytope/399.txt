Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Amir Khan posed alongside and fed a rare white tiger.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Khan feeding a white tiger. It only mentions that he posed with a giraffe and sea lions.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary about Khan feeding a white tiger is not supported by the article.
4. Additionally, the summary states that Khan enjoyed a day at a safari park with his family in northern California, but the article does not mention anything about a safari park or a trip to California.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains inaccuracies.
