Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Chelsea are in early discussions over a possible partnership with Belgian club Royal Mouscron-Peruwelz.
2. The summary repeats this information, but omits the fact that Mouscron had a previous partnership with Lille, which is mentioned in the article.
3. The article also mentions that Mouscron are currently 21st in Belgium's Pro League, while the summary does not include this information.
4. The article states that Chelsea already have an agreement with Vitesse Arnhem in Holland, and are looking at other link-ups across Europe to help develop their squad.
5. The summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important information and does not provide a complete picture of the situation. The summary should include all the information mentioned in the article, including the fact that Mouscron had a previous partnership with Lille and their current position in the league table.
