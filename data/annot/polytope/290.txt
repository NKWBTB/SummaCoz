    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Mouscron had a partnership with Lille, but that partnership is now set to end. The summary does not mention this.

2. The article mentions that Mouscron are currently 21st in the Belgian Pro League, but the summary does not include this information.

3. The article states that Chelsea already have an agreement with Vitesse Arnhem in Holland, but the summary does not mention this.

4. The article mentions that midfielder Nemanja Matic is the only current regular first-team player in Jose Mourinho's squad to have spent time on loan with Vitesse, but the summary does not include this information.

5. The article states that Bertrand Traore is one of three players currently on loan at Vitesse Arnhem from Chelsea this season, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include important details such as Mouscron's current position in the league, the ending of their partnership with Lille, and Chelsea's existing agreement with Vitesse Arnhem. Additionally, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article by leaving out important information about the players.
