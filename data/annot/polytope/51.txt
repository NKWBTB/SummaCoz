</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Lee Lewis Ferguson has just a cut on his nose to show for his ordeal.
2. The article states that Ferguson was flung from his horse in spectacular fashion at Wincanton, but there is no mention of a cut on his nose.
3. The summary implies that Ferguson's fall was a simple one, using the phrase "just a cut on his nose" to describe the aftermath.
4. The article, however, describes the fall as a "spectacular double somersault" and notes that Ferguson was "flung from his horse in spectacular fashion."
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it downplays the severity of Ferguson's fall and does not accurately reflect the details of the incident.
