` it was just a blur , ' he said .
` i could n't work out what had happened until i got back to the weighing room and watched the replay .
all the other jockeys asked me if i was all right and stuff , they all watched with me and looked away in horror .
it 's about the most impressive fall i 've seen .
` there was nothing i could do to avoid it , you just have to let it take its course and hope it 's not a bad one .
i 've been very lucky .
i got a bit of abuse from the lads and picked up a few hundred twitter followers but it 's all good banter .
` given the somersaults , maybe i 'll look at having a gymnastics career after finishing racing . ' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the teenager jockey, Lee Lewis Ferguson, was flung from his horse in a spectacular fashion at Wincanton, but the article does not mention anything about a spectacular fall.
2. The summary states that Ferguson was flung from his horse in a double somersault, but the article does not mention anything about a double somersault.
3. The summary states that Ferguson was back riding out and undeterred from getting back in the saddle, but the article does not mention anything about him returning to riding.
4. The summary states that Ferguson was an internet sensation and gained hundreds of thousands of views online, but the article does not mention anything about his fall being an internet sensation.
5. The summary states that Ferguson said "it was just a blur", but the article does not quote him saying that.
6. The summary states that other jockeys asked Ferguson if he was all right and watched the fall with him, but the article does not mention anything about other jockeys being present.
7. The summary states that Ferguson might look into having a gymnastics career after finishing racing, but the article does not mention anything about his future career plans.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it includes details that are not present in the article and omits other important details that are present in the article.
