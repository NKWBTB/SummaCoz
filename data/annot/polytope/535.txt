</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Lee Lewis Ferguson was flung from his horse in spectacular fashion at Wincanton, and that he has just a cut on his nose to show for the fall.
2. The summary states that the 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall.
3. The article does not mention anything about Ferguson mucking out the stables.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Ferguson was performing his usual stable duties after the fall, while the article states that he was flung from his horse and only suffered a cut on his nose.

Reasoning:

1. The article provides specific information about Ferguson's fall and its aftermath, including the fact that he was flung from his horse and only suffered a cut on his nose.
2. The summary omits this information and instead implies that Ferguson was performing his usual stable duties after the fall.
3. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
