</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the boy chases the family feline around the garden to get some rest, but the article states that the boy is trying to use the cat as a pillow.
2. The summary does not mention the cat's reaction to being used as a pillow, while the article states that the cat gets up and scurries away after being sat on.
3. The summary only mentions the boy following the cat to a new location, but the article shows that the cat moves multiple times and the boy follows each time.
4. The summary does not mention the cat's final decision to wander off indoors, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately portray the events described in the article. The article shows that the boy is trying to use the cat as a pillow, but the cat is not interested and moves away multiple times, while the summary only mentions the boy following the cat to a new location.
