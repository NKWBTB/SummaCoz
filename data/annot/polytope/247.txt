    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the boy used the cat as a pillow, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the boy chased the cat around the garden and the cat allowed the boy to sit on top of him.
2. The summary mentions that the cat immediately gets up and scurries over to another spot after being sat on, but the article does not mention this. The article states that the cat sat still for a brief moment before getting up and wandering off.
3. The summary states that the boy repeats the same move and rolls to the ground, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary mentions that the cat decides he's had enough of being used as a pillow and wanders off indoors, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the cat swiftly made up with the boy and the boy was seen gently feeding the cat handfuls of treats.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates and misinterprets some of the events described in the article.
