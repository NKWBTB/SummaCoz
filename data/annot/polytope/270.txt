Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Chelsea stars aim to fire balls into the boot of a car from close range. However, the article does not mention anything about firing balls into the boot of a car. Instead, the article describes the players taking part in a football challenge with Audi, where they had to sink balls into the convertible Audi's from long range.
2. The summary mentions that Eden Hazard and Nathan Ake paired up to take on Loic Remy and Willian in a head-to-head challenge for the car manufacturers. However, the article does not mention any head-to-head challenge between the players. Instead, the article describes the players taking part in various challenges, such as sinking balls into the convertible Audi's and playing football over a makeshift tennis court.
3. The summary states that the pair were involved in the biggest misfortune of the day on their way to victory. However, the article does not mention any misfortune or victory for the players. Instead, the article focuses on the football challenge and the players' performances.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article.
