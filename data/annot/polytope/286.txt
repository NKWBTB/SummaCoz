    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Carwyn Scott-Howell fell over a 164ft drop while skiing, but the article does not mention any mention of a fall or drop. Instead, it states that he became separated from his mother and was found dead in the woods.
2. The summary states that his mother, Cari, desperately tried to find her missing son, but the article does not mention any information about Cari's actions.
3. The summary states that footprints in the snow led police to Carwyn's body, but the article does not mention anything about footprints. Instead, it states that police found his body in the woods after following a trail of broken branches and sliding marks.
4. The summary states that Carwyn was a "daring, outgoing and determined" youngster, but the article does not include any information about his personality.
5. The summary states that the family is "devastated" by Carwyn's death, but the article does not include any direct quotes from the family. Instead, it includes quotes from the police and a local official.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important information that is included in the article.
