    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Chelsea players were set the challenge of sinking balls into convertible Audis from long range. However, the article does not mention anything about long-range shots or convertible Audis.
2. The summary mentions that Hazard and Ake won the first two rounds, but the article only mentions one round of challenges.
3. The summary states that the final challenge involved shooting at cars from long range, but the article only mentions shooting at the cars from close range.
4. The summary mentions that Willian and Remy redeemed themselves with a shock win, but the article does not mention any such win.
5. The summary mentions that Willian smashed the wing mirror of one of the Audis with a long-range effort, but the article does not mention any damage to the cars.

Therefore, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations that are not supported by the information in the article.
