    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the explosion occurred at a "controversial chemical plant" in China's southeastern Fujian province, while the article states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics.

2. The summary states that the explosion sparked a huge fire, while the article states that the blast occurred at an oil storage facility and that there was no toxic chemical spill.

3. The summary states that six people were injured by broken glass, while the article states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass and were sent to the hospital for treatment.

4. The summary states that more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze, while the article states that more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and that the fire is now under control.

5. The summary states that the plant was located in Zhangzhou city, while the article states that the plant was located in Zhangzhou city and that it was slated for Xiamen, a densely populated city in the southeast of the country.

6. The summary states that the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years, while the article does not mention any protests or violent incidents related to the plant.

Therefore, based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains some inaccuracies and exaggerations, such as the location of the plant, the number of injured people, and the cause of the explosion. Additionally, the summary mentions protests and violent incidents that are not present in the article.
