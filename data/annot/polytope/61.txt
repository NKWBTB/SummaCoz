</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the explosion occurred at a "controversial chemical plant" in China's southeastern Fujian province.
2. The article does not mention the word "controversial" to describe the plant. Instead, it states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics.
3. The summary implies that the explosion was the cause of the fire, while the article states that the explosion occurred at an oil storage facility and was likely caused by an oil leak.
4. The summary does not mention the oil leak or the cause of the explosion.
5. The article states that five out of six people injured were hurt by broken glass and were sent to the hospital for treatment, but the summary does not mention the injuries or the number of people affected.
6. The article states that more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and that the fire is now under control, but the summary does not mention the number of firefighters or the current status of the fire.
7. The summary mentions that the plant was slated for Xiamen, a densely populated city in the southeast of the country, but the article does not mention this.
8. The summary mentions that the plant was relocated to its current, more remote location due to pollution concerns, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or misrepresents several key details, including the cause of the explosion, the number of people injured, the current status of the fire, and the plant's location and history.
