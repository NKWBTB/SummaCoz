Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that some students believed the movie's depiction of the Iraq war reflected negatively on the Middle East.
2. The article states that the university decided to proceed with the screening of the film despite objections from some students.
3. The article does not mention any negative depiction of the Middle East in the movie.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the movie has a negative depiction of the Middle East, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that some students objected to the movie being shown, but it does not provide any information about the content of the movie.
