     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Katie Gallegos took Cooper, her Labrador, to a McDonald's drive-thru for an ice cream with his pal Daisy. However, the article does not mention Daisy or any other dog.
2. The summary mentions that Cooper gobbled the ice cream cone in one bite, but the article states that Cooper always eats very quickly.
3. The summary implies that Cooper and Daisy have a penchant for fast food, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary mentions that some viewers have criticized Gallegos for feeding her pups the creamy treat, but the article does not mention any criticism.
5. The summary states that Gallegos always makes sure Daisy gets her fill first before offering the meal, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important information that is included in the article.
