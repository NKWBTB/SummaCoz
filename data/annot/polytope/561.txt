Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Conor McGregor is challenging Jose Aldo on July 11, which is correct. However, the article provides more information about the upcoming fight, such as McGregor's new tattoo and his claims about Aldo's motivation.
2. The summary mentions that McGregor has a picture of a gorilla eating a heart tattoo, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions a tiger tattoo on McGregor's stomach.
3. The summary repeats that McGregor is challenging Aldo for the featherweight title challenge, which is not a accurate representation of the article's content. The article provides more context and details about the fight, such as McGregor's claims about Aldo's motivation and the promotional tour in Dublin.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the article's content. It only mentions a few key points, such as the date of the fight and McGregor's tattoo, but omits other important details and context.
