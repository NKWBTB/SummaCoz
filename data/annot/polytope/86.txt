</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Eden Hazard and Nathan Ake took on Loic Remy and Willian in Audi's football challenge.
2. The article states that the players were set challenges to sink balls into convertible Audis from long range, and the final challenge involved shooting at cars from long range.
3. The summary does not mention any challenges involving long-range shots or cars, only stating that the players aimed to fire balls into the boot of a car from close range.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the key details of the challenges that were part of the Audi football challenge, such as the long-range shots and the use of cars as targets.
5. The summary also does not mention the final challenge, which was the most important part of the event, where the players shot from long range to sink their footballs through the top of a convertible Audi.
6. The article provides more information about the event, such as the players using a £127,000 Audi R8 V10 plus as a makeshift tennis court and the final challenge involving long-range shots, which are not included in the summary.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the key details of the Audi football challenge and focuses only on a limited aspect of the event.
