</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francisco Totti to move continents and join him at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Pablo Osvaldo urging Pirlo and Totti to join him at Boca Juniors. Instead, the article states that Osvaldo believes that Pirlo and Totti would be a good fit for Boca and that the fans would love to have them line up on the La Bombonera pitch.
3. The summary omits the fact that Osvaldo believes that Pirlo and Totti would be a good fit for Boca, and instead presents it as if Osvaldo is directly urging them to join him at the club.
4. The summary also omits the fact that Osvaldo played with many great players over the years and that he does not want to do injustice to anyone by picking only two players.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents Osvaldo's statements and omits important information.
