Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Inconsistent language: The summary uses the term "UNK" (which stands for "unknown") to refer to the animal that was allegedly set on fire, while the article uses the correct term "quokka". This is a clear inconsistency and suggests that the summary was not accurately based on the article.
2. Incorrect location: The summary states that the incident occurred on "UNK island off perth in western australia", while the article correctly states that the incident occurred on "Rottenest Island off Perth in Western Australia".
3. Incorrect date: The summary states that the incident occurred on "April 3", while the article correctly states that the incident occurred on "April 3".
4. Incorrect charge: The summary states that the two men were charged with "trying to make contact with a UNK", while the article correctly states that they were charged with "animal cruelty".

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect language, location, date, and charge. It is clear that the summary was not accurately based on the article and may have been intentionally altered to mislead or confuse readers.
