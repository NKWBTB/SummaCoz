    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the two French tourists tried to make contact with a UNK on UNK island off Perth in Western Australia on April 3. However, the article states that the two French tourists tried to set a quokka alight on Rottnest Island off Perth in Western Australia on April 3.
2. The summary mentions an "aerosol spray" being ignited with a lighter, but the article does not mention any such item. Instead, the article states that the two men allegedly ignited a flame with a lighter, which made contact with the quokka.
3. The summary states that the two men were trying to make contact with a UNK, but the article states that they were trying to set a quokka alight.
4. The summary does not mention any injuries or harm caused to the animal, while the article states that the quokka was singed by the flame.
5. The summary does not mention any charges being brought against the two men, while the article states that they have each been charged with animal cruelty and will appear in court on April 17.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
