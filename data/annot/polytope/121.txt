    Article: 
    ( cnn ) with help from some filmmakers , 102-year-old alice barker went back in time .
barker was a dancer in such new york nightspots as the cotton club and the cafe zanzibar in the 1930s and 1940s , part of chorus lines that entertained alongside notables including bill " bojangles " robinson and frank sinatra .
there were motion pictures made of barker , but she had never seen any of them .

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alice Barker had never seen any of the motion pictures made of her, but the article states that there were motion pictures made of her. This is a contradiction, as the article implies that she had seen the motion pictures, but the summary states that she had not.

2. The summary states that Alice Barker's photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that she had never seen herself dancing until now, but does not mention the loss of her photographs and memorabilia.

3. The summary quotes Alice Barker as saying "it's just fabulous," but the article does not include this quote.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
