    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Amir Khan enjoyed a day at a safari park with his family in Northern California, but the article does not mention anything about a safari park or a family trip.
2. The summary mentions that Khan fed a rare white tiger, but the article does not mention anything about feeding a tiger. Instead, the article states that Khan posed with a giraffe and sea lions.
3. The summary states that Khan's wife and daughter were with him at the safari park, but the article does not mention anything about his family being present.
4. The summary mentions that Khan will fight Chris Algieri on May 30, but the article does not mention anything about this fight or any other upcoming fights.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article. Therefore, it is not a accurate summary of the article.
