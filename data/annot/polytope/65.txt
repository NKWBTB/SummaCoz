Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Location: The article states that Amir Khan visited a safari park in Northern California, while the summary only mentions a "safari park" without specifying the location.
2. Family members: The article mentions that Khan was joined by his wife, Faryal Makhdoom Khan, and their daughter, Lamysa, during the family trip to the safari park. However, the summary only mentions Khan and his wife posing with a giraffe, without any mention of their daughter.
3. Animals: The article mentions that Khan fed a rare white tiger during his visit to the safari park, while the summary only mentions posing with a giraffe.
4. Opponent: The article states that Khan will fight former light-welterweight world champion Chris Algieri on May 30, while the summary does not mention anything about his next opponent.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only includes a few selective details from the article, while omitting other important information. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
