1. The summary states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical. However, the article does not mention anything about PX being carcinogenic.
2. The summary states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, but the article does not mention anything about broken glass or injuries.
3. The summary does not mention the oil leak that caused the explosion, which is mentioned in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the fire being under control, which is mentioned in the article.
5. The summary does not mention the protests and violent turn that the construction of PX plants has sparked in several cities in recent years, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary omits important information, adds incorrect information, and does not accurately represent the content of the article.
