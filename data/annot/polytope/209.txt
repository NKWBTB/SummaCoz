    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott and his teammates were pictured for a photoshoot with Lanvin, the club's official tailor since 2013. However, the article does not mention anything about a photoshoot or Lanvin.
2. The summary mentions that Walcott and his teammates were pictured on a bench, but the article does not mention anything about a bench. Instead, the article shows Walcott sitting on the bench during a game and mentions that he has been overlooked for the majority of the season.
3. The summary states that Walcott and his teammates will be dressed in similar attire for the FA Cup final, but the article does not mention anything about the FA Cup final or the team's attire.
4. The summary mentions that Walcott has been named on the substitutes' bench for 17 of Arsenal's 33 Premier League games, but the article does not mention this fact.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as the photoshoot and Lanvin, and omits other important information, such as Walcott's limited playing time and his status as a substitute.
