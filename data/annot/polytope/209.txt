Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Theo Walcott and his teammates were pictured for a photoshoot with Lanvin, Paris' oldest fashion house, which is the club's official tailor since 2013.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a photoshoot with Lanvin. Instead, it mentions that Walcott and his teammates were pictured on the bench during a match against Chelsea.
3. The summary also states that Arsenal's first team stars will be dressed in similar attire when they make their way to Wembley Stadium for the FA Cup final encounter against Aston Villa on May 30.
4. However, the article does not mention anything about the FA Cup final or Arsenal's attire for the match.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions a photoshoot with Lanvin and Arsenal's attire for the FA Cup final, which are not mentioned in the article.
