fearless atif saeed , 38 , from lahore , pakistan was in the city 's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance .
mr saeed got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames .
atif saeed crept to within 10 feet of the hungry lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground
armed only with a camera , mr saeed , managed to capture a couple of frames before retreating to safety
unfortunately , the clicking sound of the camera 's shutter alerted the lion to mr saeed 's presence , who was forced to retreat quite rapidly from just 10 feet away from the lion .
he said : ` i was sitting in front of him just near my car and the door of my car was open .
i was sat on ground few feet away , so he was treating me like his prey .
` i was thinking - i must show the character and status of lion and this was the only way i could think of to achieve this .
` the story finished in few seconds as the lion aggressively jumped towards me and i just about scrambled into my car .
' was laughing at that time , but now when i think back about the incident i do n't think i would be able to do it again .
it was a pretty close encounter . ' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Atif Saeed crept up to the lion armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames, but the article states that he crept to within 10 feet of the lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground. The summary does not mention this detail.
2. The summary states that the clicking sound of the camera's shutter alerted the lion to Atif Saeed's presence, causing him to retreat rapidly. However, the article states that the lion aggressively jumped towards Atif Saeed, indicating that the clicking sound did not alert the lion to his presence.
3. The summary does not mention Atif Saeed's thoughts on the encounter, but the article includes his quotes about the incident.
4. The summary does not mention the distance between Atif Saeed and the lion, but the article states that he was within 10 feet of the lion.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details and includes inaccurate information.
