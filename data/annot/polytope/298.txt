    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the frequency of sex among Britons has been in decline since the emergence of the internet, but the article does not mention anything about the internet's impact on sexual activity.
2. The summary mentions Professor David Spiegelhalter's book and quotes him as saying that a typical heterosexual couple is now having sex three times a month, but the article does not mention this information.
3. The summary mentions that the frequency of sex has declined since the emergence of the internet, but the article actually suggests that smartphone use may be to blame for the decline in sexual activity.
4. The summary quotes Professor Spiegelhalter as saying that people are checking their emails all the time, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it suggests that the increasing number of competing demands on our time may be responsible for the decline in sexual activity.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article and omits other important information that is present in the article.
