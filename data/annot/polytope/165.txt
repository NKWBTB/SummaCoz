Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Date of death: The article states that the woman was discovered lying unconscious on March 22, while the summary states that she died last month.
2. Location of discovery: The article states that the woman was found in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, while the summary states that she was found in the Brooklyn section.
3. Tattoo description: The article provides a detailed description of the tattoo, including the name "Monique" etched across a tattooed ribbon within a heart topped with a rose. The summary only mentions a heart tattoo with the name "Monique."
4. Cause of death: The article states that the cause of death is still unknown, while the summary implies that the woman died that evening.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Date of death: The summary states that the woman died last month, which is inconsistent with the article's statement that she was discovered on March 22.
2. Location of discovery: The summary states that the woman was found in the Brooklyn section, while the article states that she was found in the Gravesend section.
3. Tattoo description: The summary only mentions a heart tattoo with the name "Monique," while the article provides a more detailed description of the tattoo.
4. Cause of death: The summary implies that the woman died that evening, while the article states that the cause of death is still unknown.
