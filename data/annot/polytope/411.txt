Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Conor McGregor has revealed a tiger's face on his stomach, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions a tiger tattoo on his stomach, but it does not describe the tattoo as a face.
2. The summary states that McGregor has no motivation to win the title in Las Vegas on July 11, but the article does not support this claim. In fact, the article states the opposite, that McGregor has a strong motivation to win the title and has been vocal about his desire to do so.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents McGregor's motivation and adds a detail (the tiger's face) that is not present in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that McGregor has no motivation to win the title in Las Vegas on July 11, but the article does not support this claim. The article mentions  the man he is challenging lacks the same motivation as him which indicates a different person. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
