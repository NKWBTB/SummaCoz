    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Conor McGregor has revealed a tiger's face on his stomach, but the article only mentions a tiger's face tattoo on his stomach.
2. The summary claims that McGregor has no motivation to win the title in Las Vegas on July 11, but the article states that McGregor has greater motivation to win the title than Jose Aldo has to defend it for the eighth time.
3. The summary implies that McGregor is not interested in winning the title, but the article states that McGregor is challenging Aldo for the featherweight champion title and has unveiled a fearsome new tattoo ahead of the encounter.
4. The summary mentions that McGregor wrote "if you see the tiger, it's too late. You're food," but this quote is not present in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and misleading information. The article portrays McGregor as a confident and motivated fighter, while the summary suggests that he lacks motivation and is not interested in winning the title.
