    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "12 per cent of people questioned thought that the child should be named after William's mother - Diana, the Princess of Wales." However, the article does not mention anything about people wanting the child to be named after Diana. Instead, it states that "diana is the favourite name for the second royal baby, named after William's mother - the late Princess of Wales." This implies that people are suggesting the name Diana for the baby, but does not mean that they want the baby to be named after William's mother.
2. The summary also states that "Alice and Charlotte were next in terms of preference, getting nine per cent of the vote each." However, the article does not mention anything about Alice or Charlotte being preferred names for the baby. It only mentions that these names are favoured as nods to William's father, Charles.
3. The summary states that "if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James." However, the article does not mention anything about James being a preferred name for a boy. Instead, it states that "if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called Alexander."
4. Finally, the summary states that "the choices were echoed on social media today, with many Twitter users claiming they would be delighted if Kate and William decided to name the baby after his mother." However, the article does not mention anything about social media reactions or users claiming that they would be delighted if the baby was named after William's mother.

In conclusion, the given summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. It is important to ensure that any summary or summary of an article accurately reflects the information and tone of the original text.
