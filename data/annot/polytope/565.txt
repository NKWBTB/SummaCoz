    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the arrested person is "UNK UNK," but the article clearly states that the arrested person is Mils Muliaina.
2. The summary states that Muliaina was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault in relation to an incident in Cardiff, but the article states that he was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault in relation to an incident in March, which is not specific to Cardiff.
3. The summary states that Muliaina was arrested after his team was defeated in the quarterfinals of the European Challenge Cup, but the article states that he was arrested after his team played against Cardiff Blues on March 6.
4. The summary states that Muliaina was led away by officers at Kingsholm Stadium, but the article states that he was arrested at Kingsholm Stadium and then led to a police van where he was detained.
5. The summary states that Muliaina has not been charged with anything, but the article states that he has been handed over to officers from South Wales Police who are investigating the incident.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions, such as the incorrect name of the arrested person, the incorrect location of the incident, and the lack of information about the allegation.
