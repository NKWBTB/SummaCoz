Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Definition of marriage: The summary states that Marco Rubio believes the "definition of the institution of marriage should be between one man and one woman," but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Rubio believes states should decide the definition of marriage, and that he does not think same-sex marriage should be a constitutional right.
2. Attendance at same-sex weddings: The summary states that Rubio would attend the same-sex wedding of a family member or staffer, even if he did not agree with the decision. However, the article does not mention this statement. Instead, the article states that Rubio said he would attend the gay wedding of someone he "cared" for, but did not specify that it would be a same-sex wedding.
3. Sexual preferences: The summary does not mention Rubio's statement that he believes people are born with a sexual preference. The article does mention this statement, but the summary does not include it.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect Rubio's statements on the definition of marriage, his attendance at same-sex weddings, and his beliefs on sexual preferences.
