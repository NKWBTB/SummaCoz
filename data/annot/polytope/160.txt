    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistent information in the summary.

The summary states that Milton Viera Severiano dragged the limp body of dancer Cicera Alves de Sena into the garden of their apartment and then shot her five times at point-blank range. However, the article states that he dragged her into the garden and then battered her head into the concrete 11 times before shooting her in the face five times.

Step 2: Analyze the reason for the inconsistency.

The inconsistency is likely due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the information in the article. The summary writer may have misread or misinterpreted the information in the article, leading to the inconsistent details.

Step 3: Identify the correct information in the article.

According to the article, Milton Viera Severiano battered his wife Cicera Alves de Sena's head into the concrete 11 times before shooting her in the face five times. The article does not mention anything about dragging her into the garden.

Step 4: Correct the inconsistent information in the summary.

To correct the inconsistency, the summary should be revised to match the correct information in the article. The revised summary should state that Milton Viera Severiano battered his wife Cicera Alves de Sena's head into the concrete 11 times before shooting her in the face five times, without mentioning that he dragged her into the garden.

After revising the summary, it should be reviewed for accuracy to ensure that it correctly reflects the information in the article. This includes checking the details of the crime, the suspect's confession, and any other relevant information.
