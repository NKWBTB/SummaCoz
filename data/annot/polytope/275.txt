Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions JNCO jeans making a comeback, but the article does not mention JNCO jeans. Instead, the article talks about the return of highly impractical jeans with giant leg openings, which could refer to various brands and styles.
2. The summary states that the trends mentioned should be left in the past, but the article does not take a definitive stance on whether these trends should be revived or not. Instead, it presents a roundup of nineties and noughties trends that are currently popular or have been popular in the past.
3. The summary mentions camouflage print, but the article does not include camouflage print as one of the trends mentioned.
4. The summary mentions double denim, but the article only mentions double denim as a trend that young reality star Kylie Jenner is currently sporting. The article does not discuss double denim as a nineties or noughties trend.
5. The summary mentions tiny denim shorts, but the article only mentions Jessica Simpson reintroducing daisy dukes in the film remake of the Dukes of Hazzard in 2005. The article does not discuss tiny denim shorts as a nineties or noughties trend.
6. The summary mentions rainbow lenses, but the article only mentions rainbow lenses as a nineties favorite for boy bands and pop princesses. The article does not discuss rainbow lenses as a current trend.
7. The summary mentions corsets, but the article only mentions corsets as a nineties trend popularized by Victoria Beckham. The article does not discuss corsets as a current trend.
8. The summary mentions harem pants, but the article only mentions harem pants as a nineties trend championed by reality star Kim Kardashian. The article does not discuss harem pants as a current trend.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions specific trends that are not mentioned in the article, and it takes a definitive stance on leaving these trends in the past, which the article does not do.
