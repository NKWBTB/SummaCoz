    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Kevin Spacey paid to have his ".sucks" domain taken down, but the article does not mention this.
2. The summary states that Taylor Swift has had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from ".porn" and ".adult" domains, but the article does not mention this either.
3. The summary suggests that the company Vox Populi is using the ".sucks" domain to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities and companies, but the article states that the company is offering the domain for $10 per year starting in September, which is not exorbitant.
4. The summary implies that Vox Populi is using coercive tactics to force celebrities and companies to purchase the ".sucks" domain, but the article states that the company is offering consumers the right to secure a ".sucks" address for $10 per year and that the advisory body representing major companies and industry groups has called the domain a "shakedown scheme" and "predatory".

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the negative aspects of Vox Populi's business and misrepresents the company's actions.
