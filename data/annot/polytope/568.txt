    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "arsenal and liverpool fans left empty seats empty at the emirates stadium." However, the article states that only a section of fans left their seats empty, not all fans.
2. The summary claims that fans are "disgusted" at the continuing rise of ticket prices, which is supported by the article. However, the summary does not provide any specific details about the protest or the reasons behind it, unlike the article.
3. The article states that the protest was held in response to the Premier League's £5.14 billion TV rights deal and the high ticket prices at the Emirates Stadium. The summary does not mention these details.
4. The article mentions that fans from both clubs gathered outside the stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. The summary does not mention this detail.
5. The article quotes Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement as saying that ticket prices are "extortionate." The summary does not include this quote.
6. The article mentions that fans are uniting against the high ticket prices and that the protest is not just limited to Arsenal and Liverpool fans, but also other fan groups. The summary does not mention this detail.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the article. It omits specific details about the protest, the reasons behind it, and the quotes from fans and fan groups. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
