<Article>
a burlesque performer is attempting to eradicate all negativity surrounding the word ` fat ' -- by embracing it as an honest , body-positive description of her own physique .
during a recent ted talk , lillian bustle , from new jersey , revealed that she also calls herself ` short ' , because she is 5 ' 3 " , and ` wife ' , because she is married , noting that each of these words is just an honest description of what she is .
and ` fat ' is just another self-descriptor for her , who insists that the word does n't have to be used as a synonym for ` ugly ' .
` we as women are programmed to tell each other that we 're not fat , because to many people - both men and women - fat is the worst thing that you can be , ' she said during her talk , which took place earlier this month .
not-so-tiny dancer : burlesque performer lillian bustle explained in her ted talk that ` fat ' is just another word - and using it does n't have to be an insult
beauty comes in bigger packages , too : during her lecture , lillian explained that ` fat ' should n't mean the same thing as ugly
unfortunately , lillian added , her worldview is n't held by everyone , and she pointed to a statistic that shows that size discrimination in the workplace has risen 66 per cent in the past 30 years .
and those negative perceptions of bigger people start young : the top ` magic wish ' for girls 11 to 17 , according to a study , is to be thinner .
lillian explained that , according to other studies , ` the more we 're exposed to body diversity , the more we tolerate , accept , and yes , even prefer , different body types ' .
that promising fact is something that encourages the dancer to perform burlesque , which enables her to expose her audiences to a ` fat ' body in a positive , glamorous way .
changing minds : studies show that the more people are exposed to different body types , the more they like them ; lillian hopes exposing her audience to a fuller figure will change their perceptions
lillian also quoted another performer named beelzebabe , who has spoken out in the past about the fact that the body diversity of burlesque performers ` challenges us to rethink the narrow confines that society has given us for what 's desirable ' .
it certainly challenged lillian , who weighs in at 240 lbs .
she admits she was in awe at the first burlesque show she ever saw , immediately resolving to try it herself .
she began performing in 2012 , and says the experience has been both empowering and incredibly body-positive .
while the first time she performed she was nervous about people seeing her arms jiggle , once she did it , she felt like she could ` walk through fire ' .
now , whenever she 's feeling insecure , she can think back to that first performance ; lillian recommends other people find a similar ` courage reference ' - a moment you felt brave that you can think back to at times when you feel more insecure and afraid .
self-esteem boost : lillian said she was nervous before her first performance because of how her arms looked , but now she feels great about her body
plump crowd-pleaser : while a few people have left nasty comments on the youtube page for her ted talk , lillian said the response has been mostly positive
though lillian gave her ted talk in 2014 , it was only posted on youtube three weeks ago .
since then , the clip has generated nearly 38,000 views - and plenty of positive feedback .
` i 've never been so happy in all my life , ' she wrote for xojane .
` i 've had this stupid grin on my face for a week straight . '
besides a few ` trolls ' posting vicious negative comments , lillian received a slew of positive messages , including letters of thanks , personal stories , and an email from a teenage girl who watched the video with her younger sister and said it made them reevaluate the way they viewed their bodies .
` i really think we - and by " we " i mean nice people and body-positivity - are winning , ' she said .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Lillian Bustle calls herself "short" because she is 5'3", but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that she calls herself "fat" and "wife" as self-descriptors.
2. The summary states that Lillian said "we as women are programmed to tell each other that we're not fat is the worst thing that you can be", but the article does not quote her as saying this exact phrase. The article does quote her as saying that "fat" is just another word and that using it does not have to be an insult.
3. The summary states that the top "magic wish" for girls 11 to 17 is to be thinner, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that studies show that exposure to body diversity can increase tolerance and acceptance of different body types.
4. The summary does not mention Lillian's experience with burlesque or her empowerment through performing, which are key points in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately represent the content of the article. It omits or misrepresents several key points and focuses on different aspects of Lillian's message.
