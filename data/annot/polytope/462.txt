Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Dani Alves has been unable to agree a new deal with the Catalan club, but the article states that his representative has confirmed that he has rejected the club's final contract offer.
2. The summary mentions that Alves will leave the Nou Camp this summer, but the article states that the negotiations are over and Alves has rejected the offer of a three-year contract extension.
3. The summary does not mention the reason for Alves' departure, but the article states that he has rejected the offer of a three-year contract extension due to the fact that it was dependent on him taking part in 60% of matches for the club.
4. The summary mentions that Alves has been linked with Manchester United and Manchester City, but the article states that he has not yet been approached by Paris Saint-Germain, despite having two offers on the table.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. It does not mention the reason for Alves' departure, and it does not accurately state the status of his contract negotiations.
