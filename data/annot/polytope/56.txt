    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Nina Moric collapsed at home due to low blood pressure, but the article states that she was taken to the hospital due to a domestic accident and fell, banging her head, and hurting everywhere.
2. The summary does not mention anything about Italian media claiming that Moric tried to take her own life, while the article mentions that Italian media reported that Moric tried to commit suicide.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Moric's boyfriend, Luigi Mario Favoloso, suggesting that she tried to commit suicide, while the article mentions that he did so.
4. The summary does not mention anything about Moric's previous attempt to commit suicide in 2009, while the article mentions it.
5. The summary does not mention anything about Moric's ex-husband, Fabrizio Corona, being jailed for blackmailing celebrities, while the article mentions it.

Overall, the summary does not provide an accurate representation of the article's content. It leaves out important details and includes information that is not supported by the article.
