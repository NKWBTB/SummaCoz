    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that the sailboat was seized off the coast of Martinique, an overseas department of France.

2. The summary states that French authorities arrested one Venezuelan and two Spanish citizens on board the vessel.

3. However, the article only mentions that French customs officers arrested one Venezuelan and two Spanish citizens, without specifying that they were French authorities.

4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the arrested individuals were French authorities, while the article only mentions that they were customs officers.

5. Additionally, the summary states that the vessel was flying an American flag, but the article does not mention this detail.

6. Overall, the summary contains information that is not supported by the article, specifically the nationality of the arrested individuals and the flag flown by the vessel.
