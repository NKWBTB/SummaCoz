Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "the porn site took over the address after the awards were scrapped in 2011 and the organisers allowed its registration to retire." However, the article states that the porn site took over the address after the awards were scrapped in 2011, but it does not mention anything about the organisers allowing its registration to retire.
2. The summary implies that the porn site took over the address because the organisers allowed it to do so, but the article does not provide any information about the organisers intentionally allowing the porn site to take over the address.
3. The summary states that "hsbc yesterday removed the hyperlink from its main website after realising its embarrassing mistake." However, the article does not mention anything about hsbc removing the hyperlink from its main website. Instead, the article states that hsbc removed the hyperlink from its community projects webpage.
4. The summary does not mention anything about hsbc apologizing for the inconvenience caused, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
