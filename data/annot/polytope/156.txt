    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the link on HSBC's official website directed visitors to a pornographic page.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a link on HSBC's official website directing visitors to a pornographic page. Instead, it states that the link on HSBC's community projects webpage directed visitors to a pornographic page.
3. The summary also states that the porn site took over the address after the awards were scrapped in 2011 and the organisers allowed its registration to retire. However, the article does not mention anything about the awards being scrapped or the organizers allowing the registration to retire.
4. The article does state that HSBC removed the hyperlink from its main website after realizing its embarrassing mistake, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article. Specifically, the summary falsely states that there was a link on HSBC's official website directing visitors to a pornographic page, and it does not mention that HSBC removed the hyperlink from its main website.
