<Article>
an obsessive arsenal fan made his girlfriend sit a test quizzing her about his favourite football club .
marking her answers with red pen , she scored an impressive 43.5 out of 50 , to which he commented , ` well done saskia !
as a result , i will not be dumping you !
( lucky you ) ' .
saskia posted snaps of the test to her twitter account , @saskiaisabxlla , commenting ` boyfriend made me take an @arsenal exam ! '
with emoticons showing she did n't know whether to laugh or cry .
we do n't blame her .
saskia 's football fan boyfriend made her take an arsenal test and did n't dump her thanks to her a grade
the test took the form of a school exam , with multiple choice questions , tables to complete , and ` in your own words ... ' section .
there were even ` helpful ' instructions including ` read every question at least twice ' and ` check your answers if you have time at the end ' .
oh , and ` calculators may be used ' .
saskia scored an impressive 87 per cent , but according to her unnamed boyfriend 's feedback she ` could have performed better on q17 ' , needs to ` learn all player positions ' and should understand that ` tottenham are scum ' .
what does the ` fc ' in arsenal fc stand for ?
what is the nickname for arsenal fans ?

who are our top 2 goalscorers of the season so far ?
what was the scoreline for the 2014 fa cup final vs hull city ?
what player scored the winning goal in the 204 fa cup final ?
why are arsenal the best team to ever grace english football ?
questions put to her in the test included :
` what was the scoreline for the 2014 fa cup final vs hull city ? '
` what player scored the winning goal in the 2014 fa cup final ? '
` name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions . '
she struggled to come up with the 11th player of the starting squad ( koscielny , defence , apparently ) and thought ozil was defence and wellbeck a midfielder , when in fact they are midfield and striker respectively .
she scored some decent points for her more creative answers .
asked to explain why alexis sanchez is better than eden hazard in her own words , she wrote , ` sanchez is buff , scores lots of goals , hazard is a p *** k , sanchez is chilean ' .
she got double marks for the hazard comment , but only got half a point for the last one .
saskia clearly knows how to keep her boyfriend happy , as she humoured his question of ` why are arsenal the best team to ever grace english football ? '
with the answer of ` they 've won many fa cups ' and ` thierry henry is a legend ' .
however , when she got an answer wrong , her examiner wrote the correct answer in capitals and drew an angry face .
this man clearly means business .

he was impressed with the end result , though , grading her an ` a ' and rewarding her by not ending their relationship .
and they say romance is dead .
comments generally hailed the man as a ` legend ' and fellow football fans were impressed with saskia 's knowledge .
some twitter users hailed the unnamed boyfriend who tested saskia on her arsenal knowledge as a legend
scoring 87 % , football fans were impressed with saskia , claiming her as ` proper gf material '
may men felt inspired , with @lewisxweeked warning his girlfriend to ` get revising '
indeed , @gstarrs85 congratulated saskia and stating that she was ` proper gf material ' .
plenty of men felt inspired by the post , with @lewisxweekes telling his girlfriend @laycijade to ` get revising ' and @digsxiii crying ` where can i get this test from ? '
others , though , felt that the boyfriend had taken things a tad too far .
@gunsaured11 stated ` football fans are nuts ' , and @dcslfc commented ` imagine actually broadcasting that your boyfriend is the biggest biff-head ever to the world . '
we reckon it was a bit of fun and he would n't really have dumped her if she 'd failed ... at least we like to think that 's the case .

some thought saskia 's boyfriend took things too far with @dcslfc creatively naming him a ` biff-head '

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Saskia's boyfriend made her take an Arsenal test and she scored an impressive 87%.
2. However, the article states that Saskia struggled to name all 11 players of the starting squad and got confused on the player positions.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that Saskia's boyfriend drew an angry face when she got a question wrong, which is a significant detail in the article.
4. The summary states that Saskia's boyfriend did not dump her thanks to her A grade, but the article states that he was impressed with the end result and graded her an A.
5. The summary does not include any of the creative answers that Saskia gave to her boyfriend's questions, which are mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include many of the details and specific examples that are present in the article. The summary is more general and does not provide the same level of information about Saskia's experience with her Arsenal-loving boyfriend.
