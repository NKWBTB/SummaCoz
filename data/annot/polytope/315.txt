    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

1. Summary: The summary states that Nina Moric tried to take her own life and was found by her mother in her luxury apartment in Milan.
2. Article: The article states that Nina Moric collapsed due to low blood pressure and was treated in hospital, but she did not try to take her own life.
3. Inconsistency: The summary claims that Nina Moric tried to take her own life, while the article states that she did not. This is an inconsistency between the two.
4. Reasoning: The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary is based on Italian media reports that Nina Moric tried to take her own life, but the article quotes Nina Moric directly and she denies these claims. The article provides a different explanation for her injuries, stating that she collapsed due to low blood pressure.
5. Conclusion: Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it relies on Italian media reports that have been denied by Nina Moric herself. The article provides a different explanation for her injuries, and it is supported by Nina Moric's own statements.
