    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Chelsea is in early discussions over a possible partnership with Belgian club Royal Mouscron-Peruwelz. However, the article does not mention any discussions between Chelsea and Mouscron-Peruwelz. Instead, the article states that Mouscron-Peruwelz had a partnership with Lille, which is now set to end, leaving room for a new deal with Chelsea.
2. The summary also states that Mouscron-Peruwelz is currently 13th in the table, two points above the relegation places. However, the article states that Mouscron-Peruwelz is 21st in Belgium's Pro League, which is not consistent with the summary's statement.
3. The summary mentions that Chelsea is looking to develop their squad through link-ups across Europe, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article focuses on the potential partnership between Chelsea and Mouscron-Peruwelz.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. Specifically, the summary:

* Misstates Mouscron-Peruwelz's current league position.
* Fails to mention the existing partnership between Mouscron-Peruwelz and Lille.
* Includes information about Chelsea's broader strategy that is not present in the article.
