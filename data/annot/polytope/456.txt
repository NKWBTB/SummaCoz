    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the two French tourists allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka. However, the article does not mention anything about an aerosol spray. Instead, it states that the tourists allegedly ignited a lighter, which caused a large flame to make contact with the quokka.
2. The summary states that the quokka was set alight, but the article states that the quokka was singed by the flame. This suggests that the quokka was not completely engulfed in flames, as the summary implies.
3. The summary states that the two men were evicted from the island, but the article does not mention anything about them being evicted. Instead, it states that they were charged with animal cruelty and will appear in court.
4. The summary states that the men were aged 18 and 24, but the article does not provide their ages.
5. The summary states that the incident occurred on April 3, but the article does not provide a specific date for the incident.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations compared to the original article.
