Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the two French tourists allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka on Rottnest Island.
2. However, the article states that the two men allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka on Rottnest Island, but the quokka survived the incident and was singed by the flame.
3. The summary does not mention that the quokka survived the incident, only that the men were charged with animal cruelty.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide all the information supported by the article. Specifically, it does not mention the quokka's survival and the fact that the men were charged with animal cruelty.
