</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Amir Khan fed a rare but dangerous white tiger. However, the article does not mention anything about Khan feeding a white tiger.
2. The summary also states that Khan posed with giraffes and sea lions, but the article only mentions that he posed with a giraffe.
3. The summary states that Khan was joined by his wife Faryal Makhdoom Khan and daughter Lamysa, but the article only mentions that he was joined by his wife and daughter.
4. The summary states that Khan will fight Chris Algieri on May 30, but the article does not mention anything about his next fight.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the summary mentions Khan feeding a white tiger, posing with sea lions, and his next fight against Chris Algieri, which are not present in the article.
