    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Dani Alves rejected a three-year contract extension with Barcelona, while the article states that the club made a final offer to Alves, which he rejected.
2. The summary implies that the reason for Alves' rejection of the contract extension is that it was dependent on him taking part in 60% of matches for the club, while the article does not mention this condition.
3. The summary states that Alves will leave Barcelona this summer, while the article does not mention a specific time frame for his departure.
4. The summary mentions that Alves has two offers on the table, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that Alves is sad about leaving Barcelona, while the article does not mention his emotional state.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.
