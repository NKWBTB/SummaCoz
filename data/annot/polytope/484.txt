Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. In the summary, it is stated that Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole in one on the fourth during the par-3 contest. However, the article does not mention anything about Nicklaus making a hole in one on the fourth hole. Instead, the article states that Nicklaus made a hole in one on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National.
2. In the summary, it is mentioned that Nicklaus held up his ball to an adoring crowd as Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw saluted him. However, the article does not mention anything about Nicklaus holding up his ball or being saluted by Player and Crenshaw.
3. In the summary, it is stated that Nicklaus was playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw as the first roar of Masters week filled the skies in a sun-swept Georgia. However, the article does not mention anything about the first roar of Masters week or the location of the event.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies identified above, it can be concluded that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.
