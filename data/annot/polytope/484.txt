    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistency
The inconsistency is that the summary states that Jack Nicklaus made a hole-in-one on the fourth hole during the par-3 contest, but the article states that he made a hole-in-one on the 130-yard hole.

Step 2: Analyze the article
According to the article, Jack Nicklaus made a hole-in-one on the 130-yard hole during the par-3 contest. The article also states that there were five hole-in-ones during the contest, and that Camilo Villegas made an ace on the fourth hole.

Step 3: Analyze the summary
The summary states that Jack Nicklaus made a hole-in-one on the fourth hole during the par-3 contest. However, this is not supported by the article, which states that he made the ace on the 130-yard hole.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistency
The summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that Jack Nicklaus made a hole-in-one on the fourth hole, when in fact he made the ace on the 130-yard hole.

Step 5: Provide evidence from the article
To support the inconsistency, we can point to the following evidence from the article: "Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole in one on the 130-yard hole during the par-3 contest." This contradicts the summary, which states that he made the ace on the fourth hole.
