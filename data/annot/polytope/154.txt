Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the algae glows in the spring and autumn, but the summary only mentions that it glows in the summer.

2. The article explains that the glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, a single-celled phytoplankton, but the summary does not mention this.

3. The article mentions that the glow is a defense mechanism, but the summary does not mention this.

4. The article states that the display was shown in Jervis Bay and Manly Beach, but the summary only mentions Jervis Bay.

5. The article provides more details about the phenomenon, such as the fact that it is caused by millions of plankton omitting light, but the summary does not include these details.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide all the information included in the article, and it does not accurately convey the main points of the article.
