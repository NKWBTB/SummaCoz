    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the images were taken in Jervis Bay, which is on the south coast of New South Wales. However, the article states that the images were taken in Jervis Bay, which is on the south coast of New South Wales.

2. The summary states that the glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, a single-celled phytoplankton. However, the article states that the glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, a single-celled phytoplankton, but also mentions that the algae blossoms in the spring and autumn and in 90% of occasions occurs due to natural causes.

3. The summary does not mention the fact that the glow is a defense mechanism of the algae, as stated in the article.

4. The summary states that a similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent all the information provided in the article. The summary leaves out important details, such as the fact that the glow is a defense mechanism of the algae, and includes information that is not present in the article, such as the display in Manly Beach.
