Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that West Ham are discussing a deal for Deshane Beckford, and that he has impressed coaches during his two-week trial with the club.
2. The summary does not mention any discussion of a deal or the coaches' impressions of Beckford. Instead, it simply states that he was invited to train with West Ham's academy earlier this month.
3. The article mentions that Beckford has been linked with a host of European clubs, but the summary does not include this information.
4. The article also mentions that West Ham are closing in on the signature of Beckford, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include key details about Beckford's trial with West Ham and the club's interest in signing him. Additionally, it omits information about Beckford's links to other European clubs and West Ham's efforts to sign him.
