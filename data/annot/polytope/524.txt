    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that West Ham is inviting Beckford to train with their academy, but the article states that Beckford has been on trial with West Ham and has impressed the coaches. The summary does not mention the trial aspect.
2. The summary mentions that Beckford has been linked with a host of European clubs, but the article only mentions offers from clubs in Belgium.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that West Ham is closing in on signing Beckford, while the article reveals this information.
4. The summary mentions the cost of season tickets at West Ham's new stadium, but this is not relevant to the information about Beckford.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
