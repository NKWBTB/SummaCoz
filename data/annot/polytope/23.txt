1. The summary states that the National Weather Service indicated a tornado may have touched down in Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it claims that a tornado touched down in Potosi, while the article does not support this claim.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The summary makes a specific claim about a tornado in Potosi, Missouri.
2. The article does not support this claim.
