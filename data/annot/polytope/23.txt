    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Location of tornado: The summary states that a tornado touched down in Potosi, Missouri, but the article states that the tornado was reported in Goddard, Kansas, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita.
2. Location of storms: The summary mentions storms in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Tennessee River Valley, and near the Southern Great Lakes, but the article only mentions storms in Kansas and Missouri.
3. Damage: The summary mentions wind damage and flooding in Potosi, but the article only mentions damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water in the town.
4. Instagram pictures: The summary mentions an Instagram picture of unusual dark clouds, but the article does not mention any such picture.
5. Hail: The summary mentions baseball-size hail, but the article only mentions hail in one location, and it does not specify the size.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and it omits information that is present in the article.
