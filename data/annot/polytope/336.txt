    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Conor McGregor has revealed a tiger's face tattooed onto his stomach, but the article does not mention any tiger tattoo.
2. The summary mentions that McGregor has a picture of a gorilla eating a heart inked upon his chest, which is not mentioned in the article.
3. The summary states that McGregor wrote on Instagram that "if you see the tiger, it's too late. You're food," but the article does not mention this quote.
4. The summary mentions that McGregor grabbed Jose Aldo's belt during a promotional tour in Dublin, but the article does not mention this event.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other information that is present in the article.
