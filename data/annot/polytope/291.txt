</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "the two men's achievements, in and out of the ring, ahead of their $300m mega-fight on May 2." However, the article does not mention any achievements of the boxers outside of the ring. The article focuses solely on their achievements in the ring and their preparations for the upcoming fight.
2. The summary states that the fight is for $300m, which is not consistent with the article. The article mentions that the fight is expected to generate $440 million (£295m) for Mayweather and $340 million (£228m) for Pacquiao.
3. The summary does not mention Mayweather's business interests, investments in real estate, or his relationship with Doralie Medina. These details are present in the article.
4. The summary does not mention Pacquiao's political career, ambitions to become the President of the Philippines, or his religious beliefs. These details are present in the article.
5. The summary does not mention Pacquiao's basketball team or his marriage to Jinkeee, or his five children. These details are present in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it only highlights the boxers' achievements in the ring and does not include any information about their personal lives or business ventures, which are significant aspects of the article.
