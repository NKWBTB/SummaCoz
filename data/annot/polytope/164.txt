    Article: 
    a new zealand couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the uk , so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck .
hannah and alex purchased a 1986 hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love .
the result was a solar-powered two-bedroom , wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in nelson , new zealand .
how a truck becomes a home : a new zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck
making do : alex ( left ) and hannah ( right ) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own , but could n't afford to buy a full-sized lot
` we came back to new zealand from the uk in 2009 , ' alex told smoking tire .
` we knew we could n't afford to buy property at that point .
we did n't have money . '
so , the couple started building .
after a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time , the project took shape .
though , to hear hannah tell it , they just slapped up the place in a weekend .
' [ we ] welded a frame , put the wood on and built this house , ' the modest kiwi told smoking tire 's matt farah .
once they finished , the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they 'd purchased in nelson , new zealand .
now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature : aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door .
ingenuity : the couple started with a steel frame and slowly , project by project , built a home in about a year and a half
gorgeous : hannah and alex now have a gorgeous , wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook
details : the couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold , stained glass windows and other creature comforts
they 're nearly self-sufficient , too .
the home is powered mostly by solar panels .
alex said their first power bill was just $ 25 .
the stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring .
` i did n't want to live inside a plastic box , ' alex said .
` not because i 'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be . '
all told , the project cost hannah and alex about $ 25,000 .
and the couple even plans to build another one like one day .
` it 's really , really nice , ' hannah said .
` we love it . '
two bedrooms : the home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps
green : water comes from a nearby spring and most of the electricity comes from solar panels 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the couple built their home on the back of an old flatbed truck, but the article states that they built the home on the bed of a flatbed truck.
2. The summary mentions that the home is solar-powered, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that the couple wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary mentions that the couple started building the home after returning to New Zealand from the UK, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that the home has two bedrooms, but the article only mentions one bedroom for the couple and a loft that doubles as a spare room for the cat.
6. The summary mentions that the home is self-sufficient, but the article only mentions that the home is powered by gas and has a wood-fired stove, but does not mention anything about self-sufficiency.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, omits details that are present in the article, and includes inconsistencies in the language used to describe the home.
