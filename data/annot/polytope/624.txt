    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's the step-by-step explanation of why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that Amir Khan and his wife UNK Khan were pictured in a safari park in Northern California, but the article does not mention anything about a safari park or Northern California.
2. The summary states that Khan was joined by his wife UNK UNK Khan and their daughter UNK, but the article only mentions Khan's wife Faryal Makhdoom Khan and their daughter Lamysa.
3. The summary mentions that Khan fed a rare white tiger, but the article does not mention anything about feeding animals or a white tiger.
4. The summary states that Khan's next fight will be against Chris Algieri at welterweight on May 30, but the article does not mention anything about a fight against Chris Algieri or a specific date for the fight.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations that are not supported by the article.
