Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Amir Khan and his "wife UNK Khan" were pictured in a safari park in northern California. However, the article does not mention UNK Khan as Amir Khan's wife. Instead, the article mentions Faryal Makhdoom Khan as Amir Khan's wife.
2. The summary also states that Amir Khan was joined by his "wife UNK UNK Khan" and their "daughter UNK" on the family trip to the safari park. However, the article does not mention any additional children or wives for Amir Khan.
3. The summary states that Amir Khan has announced his next fight will be against Chris Algieri at welterweight on May 30. This is consistent with the article, which states that Amir Khan will fight Chris Algieri on May 30.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a non-existent wife and daughter for Amir Khan, and also refers to UNK Khan as Amir Khan's wife, which is not correct.
