Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the teachers threatened to remove Logan from class because the oils smelled and were a distraction to youngsters around him. However, the article states that the teachers threatened to remove Logan because the oils smelled and were creating a problem for staff and students.

2. The summary mentions that the family uses Detorra oils with scents such as lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood. However, the article does not mention the specific brand of oils being used.

3. The summary states that Lake County School District told the station they would not suspend Logan, saying it was a health issue. However, the article does not mention anything about Lake County School District or a health issue.

Based on these differences, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary emphasizes the smell of the oils and the distraction they cause, while the article focuses on the school's threat to suspend Logan due to the oils creating a problem for staff and students. Additionally, the summary mentions a specific brand of oils being used, while the article does not provide that detail. Finally, the summary mentions a health issue as the reason for the school's decision, while the article does not mention any such reason.
