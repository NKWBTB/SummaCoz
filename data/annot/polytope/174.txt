    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the teachers threatened to remove Logan from the classroom because the oils smelled and were a distraction to other students. However, the article states that the teachers threatened to remove Logan because the oils smelled and created a "problem" for staff and students.
2. The summary mentions that the family uses Detorra oils, but the article does not mention this specific brand of oils.
3. The summary states that the school district told the station they would not suspend Logan, saying it was a health issue. However, the article does not mention this statement from the school district.

Based on these differences, it appears that the summary is not an accurate representation of the article. The summary emphasizes the issue of the oils smelling and being a distraction, while the article focuses more on the school's reaction to the oils and the potential health benefits for Logan. Additionally, the summary mentions a specific brand of oils that is not mentioned in the article.
