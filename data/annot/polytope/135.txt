Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Jack Grealish wears children's shinpads, while the article states that he wears children's shinpads and keeps his stockings above the roll of his shinpads.
2. The summary does not mention Grealish's superstition about keeping his socks above the roll of his shinpads, while the article highlights this as a reason why he will continue to wear his socks in this way.
3. The summary states that Grealish appears not to wear shinpads on first glance, but the article reveals that he does wear shinpads, just in a children's size.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the information about Grealish's shinpads and socks. The article provides more detail and context about Grealish's unique footwear choices, which the summary does not capture.
