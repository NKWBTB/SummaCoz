</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill." However, the article states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), which is a reportedly carcinogenic chemical. This contradicts the summary's statement that there was no toxic chemical spill.
2. The article states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, but the summary does not mention anything about injuries or casualties. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content.
3. The article mentions that the plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, but the summary does not include this information. This omission suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's content.
4. The article provides details about the plant's location, the number of firefighters sent to battle the blaze, and the fact that the plant was relocated due to pollution concerns. These details are not included in the summary, which suggests that the summary is not a comprehensive summary of the article's content.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details, contradicts the article's content, and is not a complete representation of the article's content.
