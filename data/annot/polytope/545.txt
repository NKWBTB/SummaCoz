    Article: 
    hong kong ( cnn ) six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in china 's southeastern fujian province sparked a huge fire , provincial authorities told state media .
the plant , located in zhangzhou city , produces paraxylene ( px ) , a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics .
the blast occurred at an oil storage facility monday night after an oil leak , though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill .
five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment , xinhua news agency reported .
more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control , the zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account tuesday morning .
residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to weibo to post photos of the fire .
one user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors .
the plant was hit by another explosion in july 2013 , although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time .
though demonstrations are illegal in china , the construction of px plants has sparked protests , which have occasionally turned violent , in several cities in recent years .
the zhangzhou plant was slated for xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country .
however , it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current , more remote location . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the explosion occurred at an oil storage facility, but the article does not mention anything about an oil storage facility. Instead, the article states that the explosion occurred at a controversial chemical plant that produces paraxylene (PX).
2. The summary does not mention that the plant produces PX, which is a reportedly carcinogenic chemical. The article mentions that the plant produces PX, which is a key detail that is missing from the summary.
3. The summary states that local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill, but the article mentions that the plant produces a reportedly carcinogenic chemical. This suggests that there may have been a toxic chemical spill, even if it has not been reported by local media.
4. The summary mentions that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, but the article does not mention any injuries or casualties.
5. The summary mentions that the fire is under control, but the article does not mention the status of the fire.
6. The summary does not mention the protests and controversy surrounding the plant's construction, which is a key detail mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits key details, includes incorrect information, and does not provide a complete picture of the events.
