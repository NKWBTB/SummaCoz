Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Jack Grealish wears children's shinpads, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that he wears low socks.
2. The article also mentions that Grealish has a superstition about wearing his socks above his shinpads, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary does not provide any information about Grealish's reason for wearing low socks or his superstition about it.
4. The article provides more details about Grealish's first Premier League start for Aston Villa, including his happiness about getting the start and his desire to earn more starts before the end of the season.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about Grealish's sock-wearing habits and superstitions, and it does not mention his first Premier League start or his feelings about it.
