</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. In the summary, it is stated that Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole-in-one on the fourth during the par-3 contest. However, in the article, it is mentioned that Nicklaus made a hole-in-one on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National, not on the fourth hole.
2. In the summary, it is written that Nicklaus holds up his ball to an adoring crowd as Gary Player (left) and Ben Crenshaw salute the great. However, in the article, it is stated that Crenshaw and Nicklaus fist-pumped following his ace on the 130-yard hole, but there is no mention of Player.
3. In the summary, it is mentioned that Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket in 1963, but this is not accurate. The article states that Nicklaus collected his sixth green jacket in 1986, not in 1963.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in the following ways:

1. The hole-in-one was made on a different hole than stated in the summary.
2. Gary Player was not present during the hole-in-one, as stated in the summary.
3. The year Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket is incorrect.

These inconsistencies suggest that the summary was not accurately written based on the information provided in the article.
