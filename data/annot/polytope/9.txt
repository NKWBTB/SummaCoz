     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Jack Nicklaus made a hole-in-one on the fourth hole during the par-3 contest, but the article states that he made the ace on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National.
2. The summary mentions that Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw saluted Nicklaus' great shot, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with his hole-in-one, but the article does not mention the crowd's reaction.
4. The summary mentions that Nicklaus was playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that Nicklaus' ace was his first on the hallowed turf of Augusta, but the article states that he has won the tournament six times before.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations that do not match the information in the article.
