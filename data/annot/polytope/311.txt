    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti to move continents and join him at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Pirlo and Totti joining Boca Juniors. Instead, it states that Osvaldo believes they would be a good fit for the club and that the fans would love to have them line up on the La Bombonera pitch.
3. The article quotes Osvaldo as saying that he would like to play with Pirlo and Totti at Boca, but he does not explicitly state that he has urged them to join the club.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Pirlo and Totti are being urged to join Boca, while the article only states that Osvaldo believes they would be a good fit for the club.
5. The article does not provide any information about Pirlo and Totti moving continents or joining Boca Juniors, so the summary is not supported by the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Pirlo and Totti are being urged to join Boca, while the article only states that Osvaldo believes they would be a good fit for the club. The article does not provide any information about their potential moves to Boca Juniors.
