</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francisco Totti to move continents and join him at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors.
2. However, the article states that Osvaldo believes that Pirlo and Totti would be a good fit for Boca, but he does not explicitly urge them to move continents and join him.
3. The summary omits the phrase "who I would like to join me at Boca" which is present in the article.
4. The summary also omits the phrase "i don't want to do injustice to anyone" and "if i had to pick two" which are present in the article.
5. The summary does not accurately convey the tone of the article, as it does not include the quotes from Osvaldo about Pirlo and Totti being perfect for Boca and the Bombonera going absolutely crazy for them.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reasons for this inconsistency are:

* Omitting the phrase "who I would like to join me at Boca"
* Omitting the phrase "i don't want to do injustice to anyone" and "if i had to pick two"
* Not accurately conveying the tone of the article.
