every woman surveyed in paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city 's public transport
the poll of 600 women from the area around paris found that half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18 .
harassment can range from " insults to other intimidating behaviour ( insistent flirting , whistling , comments on appearance ) , to sex attacks or rape , " it said .
the problem meant that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men .
often " invisible " because unreported , these physical and verbal attacks limit " the freedom of women , because they are often obligated to alter their daily lives : changing their routes , modes of transportation , schedules , attitudes and clothing in order to avoid confrontation , " the report handed to the french women 's rights ministry this week , claimed .
the result was to " exclude women from the public arena " , it said .
pascale boisard , president of the high council for gender equality , which compiled the report , told le parisien she had not realised that " the problem was quite this widespread " .

" women must be able to move about and occupy the public space without being placed in danger or threatened .
it 's a fundamental freedom , " she said .
ernestine ronai , also on the council , said : " attackers are the impression they can act with total impunity , notably by making use of a crowd to hide and flee .
" women do n't necessarily know how to put words on what they go through in public transport .
it should be reiterated that putting your hand on someone 's backside is sexual assault punishable by a five-year prison term and a € 75,000 fine . "
she said women needed to be better " educated that what they 're going through is not normal " , and that the message must reach " aggressors and witnesses " . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that every woman surveyed in Paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on public transport, but the article does not say this. Instead, it says that "half of them were assaulted before they were 18 years old."
2. The summary mentions calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behavior on buses and trains, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it focuses on the findings of the survey and the impact of harassment on women's lives.
3. The summary states that "every female user of mass transit has been a victim" of gender harassment or sexual assault, but the article does not say this. Instead, it says that "half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18."
4. The summary mentions "insults to other intimidating behavior" as forms of harassment, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it focuses on physical and verbal attacks, and notes that these can range from "insistent flirting" to "sex attacks or rape."
5. The summary states that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport, compared to three out of ten men, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it notes that women are more likely to be victims of harassment, but does not provide specific statistics.
6. The summary mentions that the problem is "invisible" because unreported, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it notes that the survey found that many women had experienced harassment, but that the true extent of the problem may be underreported.
7. The summary states that the result of the harassment is to "exclude women from the public arena," but the article does not mention this. Instead, it notes that the survey found that harassment limits the freedom of women and can cause them to alter their daily lives.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the extent of the problem, misrepresents the findings of the survey, and includes information that is not supported by the article.
