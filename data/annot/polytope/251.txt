    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll, a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off. However, the article does not mention anything about O'Carroll joining Hacked Off. Instead, it reports that O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation.
2. The summary implies that O'Carroll is a backer of Hacked Off, which would be an embarrassment to the group. However, the article does not mention any embarrassment or controversy surrounding O'Carroll's attendance at the rally. In fact, the article states that the meeting was "open to and free for all members of the public to attend."
3. The summary mentions that PIE campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s, but the article does not provide any information about PIE's campaigns or activities.
4. The summary states that O'Carroll was jailed in 1981 for "corrupting public morals," but the article does not mention any information about O'Carroll's criminal history or conviction.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article. The summary also implies a level of involvement or endorsement by O'Carroll that is not supported by the article.
