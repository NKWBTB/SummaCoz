</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Tom O'Carroll, a former member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off.

2. The summary does not mention that O'Carroll is a former member of PIE, which is a significant detail that is present in the article.

3. The article also mentions that PIE campaigned to legalize child sex in the 1970s and 80s, which is not mentioned in the summary.

4. The summary only mentions that O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation, without mentioning his background or the nature of PIE's campaigns.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail about O'Carroll's background and the nature of PIE's campaigns.

6. The article is likely to be an embarrassment to Hacked Off because O'Carroll's involvement with PIE may be seen as contradictory to the group's goals and values.

7. The article also highlights the potential risks of allowing individuals with controversial backgrounds to participate in media regulation efforts.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits significant details about O'Carroll's background and the nature of PIE's campaigns. The article is likely to be an embarrassment to Hacked Off and highlights the potential risks of allowing individuals with controversial backgrounds to participate in media regulation efforts.
