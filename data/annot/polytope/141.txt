    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the pool was drained to create a unique catwalk for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia, but the article does not mention anything about the pool being drained. Instead, it states that the pool was empty due to the fashion show.
2. The summary mentions that the collection was designed to be worn in 20 different ways, but the article only mentions that the collection consists of ten pieces.
3. The summary states that guests were treated to nibbles by Icebergs and drinks from Santa Vittoria, but the article does not mention anything about nibbles or drinks.
4. The summary mentions a presentation of entirely monochrome creations, but the article only mentions that the collection is unisex and suitable for day to night wear.
5. The summary states that the show took place on an unseasonably warm 28 degrees Celsius day, but the article does not mention the temperature.
6. The summary mentions that beachgoers at Bondi stopped and stared as the catwalk show took place, but the article does not mention anything about beachgoers.
7. The summary states that the collection is designed to be worn by both sexes, but the article only mentions that the collection is unisex.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations compared to the article. It seems to have been written with the intention of creating a more exciting and sensationalized story, rather than providing an accurate summary of the article's content.
