</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the icebergs club pool was drained to create a unique catwalk for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia.
2. The article does not mention anything about the pool being drained. Instead, it states that the pool was empty and used as a catwalk setting.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that the pool was drained, while the article does not support this claim.
4. The article does mention that the pool was empty, but it does not provide any information about it being drained.
5. The summary also mentions that the collection of ten pieces is designed to be worn in 20 different ways, but the article does not provide this information.
6. Finally, the summary mentions that guests were treated to nibbles by Icebergs and drinks from Santa Vittoria, but the article does not mention anything about this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the text, such as the pool being drained, and omits other important details, such as the fact that the collection is designed to be worn in 20 different ways.
