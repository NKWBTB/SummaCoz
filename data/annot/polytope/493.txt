Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "sirens blared Wednesday night in Kansas as several storms brought reports of twisters." This is consistent with the article, which reports that tornado sirens were heard in Kansas due to storms that brought reports of tornadoes.
2. The summary also states that "nighttime tornadoes are the most deadly, are the most dangerous." This is not consistent with the article, which does not make a distinction between daytime and nighttime tornadoes in terms of danger or deadliness. The article simply reports that there were tornadoes in Kansas and Missouri, without mentioning any specific time of day.
3. The summary mentions "other reports of tornadoes came in from southwestern Kansas." This is not consistent with the article, which does not mention any specific location for the tornadoes other than Goddard, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it adds information that is not present in the article and makes a distinction between daytime and nighttime tornadoes, which is not supported by the article.
