    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "nighttime tornadoes are the most deadly and dangerous," but the article does not say this. In fact, the article quotes CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers as saying that "there will be storms... that pop up all night long," without emphasizing the danger of nighttime tornadoes specifically.
2. The summary mentions tornado sightings in southwestern Kansas, but the article does not mention any specific locations of tornado sightings. The article only mentions that tornado sirens blared in Kansas and that spotters reported a tornado near Goddard, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita.
3. The summary mentions three tornado sightings near Aetna, which is 125 miles southwest of Wichita, but the article does not mention any tornado sightings in that location.
4. The summary mentions a tornado touching down in the small town of Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis, but the article does not mention any tornado sightings in Missouri.
5. The summary mentions damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water in Potosi, but the article does not mention any specific damage or flooding in that location.
6. The summary mentions an Instagram user posting a photo of a fallen tree in Potosi, but the article does not mention any specific social media reports of damage.
7. The summary mentions that more storms are expected in the midwest, Mississippi River valley, Tennessee River valley, and near the southern Great Lakes, but the article does not mention any future weather forecast.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes specific details that are not mentioned in the article, such as the location of tornado sightings, the danger of nighttime tornadoes, and specific damage reports. Additionally, the summary mentions future weather forecasts that are not included in the article.
