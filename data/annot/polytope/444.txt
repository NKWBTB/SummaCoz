2. The summary states that Rubio thinks same-sex marriage should not be a constitutional right, but the article does not mention this. Rubio is quoted as saying that he believes states should decide on the definition of marriage, but he does not explicitly state that same-sex marriage should not be a constitutional right.
3. The summary states that Rubio believes people are born with a sexual preference, but the article does not mention this. Rubio is quoted as saying that he believes sexual preference is something that people are born with, but this is not explicitly stated in the article.
4. The summary states that Rubio would attend the gay wedding of a family member or staffer, even if he didn't agree with the decision, but the article does not mention this. Rubio is quoted as saying that he would attend the wedding of someone he cared for, but the article does not specify that this would be a same-sex wedding.
