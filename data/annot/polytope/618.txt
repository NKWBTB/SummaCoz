    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is in a medically induced coma, but the article states that she is no longer in a medically induced coma but remains unresponsive. This is not consistent, as the summary suggests that she is still in a coma, while the article states that she is not.
2. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved, but the article states that she remains unresponsive and has global and irreversible brain damage. This is not consistent, as the summary suggests that her condition has improved, while the article states that her condition is still severe.
3. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is watching her father, Bobby Brown, but the article states that she does not respond to visitors or familiar voices. This is not consistent, as the summary suggests that she is able to watch and respond to her father, while the article states that she is not able to respond to anyone.
4. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved, but the article states that the kind of life she will lead remains to be seen. This is not consistent, as the summary suggests that her condition has improved and she will have a long life, while the article states that her condition is still uncertain.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides a more accurate and detailed picture of Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition, which is not as positive as the summary suggests.
