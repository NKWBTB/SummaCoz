Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is not in a medically induced coma anymore, but she remains unresponsive and has global and irreversible brain damage.

Source: "Bobbi Kristina Brown, the daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, has 'global and irreversible brain damage,' according to her grandmother."

2. The article also states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is undergoing a rehabilitation process, but the quality of her life will not be known for years to come.

Source: "doctors have indicated that she will have a long life, but Bobbi Kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process, and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come."

3. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is in a medically induced coma, which is not consistent with the article.

Source: "bobbi kristina brown is in a medically induced coma, her grandmother says."

4. The summary also states that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved, which is partially consistent with the article, but the article states that her condition is still unresponsive and she has global and irreversible brain damage.

Source: "bobbi kristina brown's condition has improved, but that the kind of life will be seen."

5. The summary does not mention anything about Bobbi Kristina Brown's mother or grandmother visiting her or making statements about her condition, which is not consistent with the article.

Source: "Cissy Houston, Bobbi Kristina Brown's grandmother, made a statement on Monday after visiting her granddaughter, saying that she remains unresponsive and has global and irreversible brain damage."

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it misstates Bobbi Kristina Brown's current medical state and does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
