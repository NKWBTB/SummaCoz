</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the frequency of sex among Britons has been declining since the emergence of the internet.
2. However, the article states that Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, revealed in a new book that a typical heterosexual couple is now having sex three times a month.
3. The article does not mention anything about a decline in the frequency of sex since the emergence of the internet. In fact, it suggests the opposite - that the frequency of sex has remained steady over the past few decades.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it claims that the frequency of sex is declining, while the article states that the frequency is steady.
5. It's possible that the summary was based on outdated information or a different study, but without more context, it's difficult to say for sure.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim about the frequency of sex that is not supported by the information in the article.
