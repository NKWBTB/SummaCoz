     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the mother was arrested after receiving medical attention, but the article states that she was arrested before receiving medical attention.

2. The summary says the mother was charged with neglect, but the article does not mention any charges.

3. The summary states that the mother was found to have blood on her, but the article does not mention any blood.

4. The summary says the mother was in a trance, but the article does not mention this.

5. The summary states that the mother refused to look at her baby or talk to police, but the article states that she was approached by police and her identity was discovered through her purse.

6. The summary says the mother was taken to the same hospital as her daughter, but the article does not mention this.

7. The summary states that the infant was declared healthy after being checked over by doctors, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that the mother was arrested after receiving medical attention, but the article states that she was arrested before receiving any medical attention. Additionally, the summary mentions the mother being in a trance, but the article does not mention this.
