    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the two French tourists allegedly ignited an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with a quokka on Rottnest Island.
2. However, the article states that the two French tourists tried to set the quokka alight, which is a more intentional and malicious act than simply igniting an aerosol spray.
3. The summary does not mention the intentional nature of the act, which is a key aspect of the article's reporting.
4. Additionally, the summary states that the quokka was "singed" by the flame, which suggests that the animal was only superficially burned, whereas the article states that the quokka was the "innocent victim" of a "cruel act" and was "singed" by the flame.
5. Finally, the summary does not mention the charges brought against the two French tourists, which is a significant aspect of the article's reporting.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and that the summary has left out or altered key information from the article.
