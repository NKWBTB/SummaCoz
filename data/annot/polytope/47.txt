</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the quokka was "singed" by the flame, indicating that it was burned.
2. However, the article states that the quokka "survived the reckless incident" and was not burned to death.
3. The summary also states that the quokkas can be found on "some small islands off the west australian coast", while the article specifically mentions Rottnest Island and Bald Island.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the two French tourists were charged with animal cruelty.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Misstates the extent of the quokka's injuries.
* Oversimplifies the location of the quokkas.
* Omits a key detail (the charges against the two tourists).

Overall, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
