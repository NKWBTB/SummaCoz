Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Jack Grealish takes to Aston Villa for his first Premier League start on Tuesday night.
2. However, the article states that Grealish made his first Premier League start for the club in the pulsating 3-3 draw against QPR on Tuesday night.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Grealish's unique sock-wearing style, while the article highlights it as a distinct feature of his playing style.
4. The summary does not mention Grealish's superstition about wearing his socks above his shinpads, which is a significant detail mentioned in the article.
5. The summary does not provide any specific quotes from Grealish, while the article includes several quotes from the player.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about Jack Grealish's first Premier League start for Aston Villa, and it omits important details about his unique sock-wearing style and superstition.
