     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Jack Grealish will "carry on that way" with wearing his socks high, but the article states that he wears children's shinpads and has been told by referees to pull his socks up.
2. The summary does not mention Grealish's superstition about wearing his socks high, which is mentioned in the article.
3. The summary states that Grealish is "renowned for wearing his socks low" when he takes the field, but the article states that he wears children's shinpads, which are not visible when he is on the field.
4. The summary does not mention Grealish's statement about not changing his way of wearing socks, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It does not mention some of the key details mentioned in the article, and it misrepresents other details.
