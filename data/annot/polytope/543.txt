    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is no longer in a medically induced coma, while the article states that she remains in a medically induced coma.
2. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown is unresponsive, while the article states that she has "global and irreversible brain damage" and does not respond to visitors or familiar voices.
3. The summary does not mention the tracheostomy that the article states Bobbi Kristina Brown has.
4. The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved, while the article states that her condition remains the same as it has been for nearly three months.
5. The summary mentions that Bobbi Kristina Brown has started a rehabilitation process, while the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the current state of Bobbi Kristina Brown's health. The article provides more detailed and accurate information about her condition, including the fact that she remains in a medically induced coma and has significant brain damage.
