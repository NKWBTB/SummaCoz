    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that two French tourists allegedly set a quokka on fire using an aerosol spray and a lighter.

2. The summary states that two men allegedly set a quokka on fire using an aerosol spray and a lighter.

3. The article and summary are consistent in their description of the incident and the individuals involved.

4. However, the summary states that the quokka was "singed" by the flame, while the article states that the quokka survived the incident.

5. This discrepancy indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not support the claim that the quokka was singed.

6. Therefore, the summary is not a consistent summary of the article.
