Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Gary Locke has been given the role on a permanent basis after signing a three-year deal.
2. The summary states that Gary Locke has been given the job at Kilmarnock on a permanent basis after a successful interim spell.
3. The article does not mention anything about an interim spell, only that he has been given the role on a permanent basis.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions an interim spell, which is not mentioned in the article.

The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary is based on outdated information, as the article has since been updated to reflect the permanent appointment of Gary Locke. The summary was likely written before the update was made.
