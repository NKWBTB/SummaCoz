    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that an Afghan lawmaker, Humayoon Humayoon, was among the 64 people wounded in the suicide bombing.
2. The summary states that Humayoon Humayoon was on his way to join a larger rally against the provincial governor.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. If Humayoon Humayoon was on his way to join a rally, he would not have been wounded in the suicide bombing, as the rally had not yet taken place.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reason for this inconsistency is that the summary contains incorrect information about Humayoon Humayoon's activities at the time of the suicide bombing.
