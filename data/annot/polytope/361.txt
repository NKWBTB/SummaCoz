    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Carwyn fell to his death while skiing with his family in the Alps, but the article does not mention anything about him skiing with his family. Instead, it states that he became separated from his mother while she was helping his sister, and he headed into dense woodland where he fell over a 164ft drop.
2. The summary mentions that Carwyn was a "daring, outgoing and determined" youngster, but the article does not provide any information about his personality or character.
3. The summary states that Carwyn's family is staying in a hotel close to the slopes where he died, but the article does not mention anything about the family's accommodation.
4. The summary mentions that police found Carwyn's body by following his footprints in the snow, but the article does not mention anything about the police finding his body or the footprints. Instead, it states that the family and search teams were looking for him.
5. The summary states that Carwyn was heading for the resort when he fell, but the article does not mention anything about him heading for the resort. Instead, it states that he became separated from his mother and headed into dense woodland.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.
