    Article: 
    police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place -- despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker .
last night the victim , mike lane , 40 , who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes , condemned the decision by police as ` pathetic ' .
he said : ` they could have made more effort .
i 've been told that unless further evidence comes forward , the attackers are not likely to be found .
we find it pathetic . '
attack : mike lane ,40 , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs
a video of the incident and a dossier of evidence , including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers , was given to wiltshire police after the assault .
the attack at everleigh , near amesbury , took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent , rather than a fox .
during the incident , mr lane , who is joint master of the tedworth hunt , was sent flying to the ground , before being kicked in the head .
he was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen .
since the attack he has suffered memory loss .
the face of the thug who kicked mr lane was captured on video .
following the attack , wiltshire police issued the suspect 's photograph , although he has not been identified .
in an exclusive interview with the mail on sunday , mr lane said : ` i 've been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence .
it 's angered us because we gave them evidence .
i 'm beginning to lose my trust in the police . '
wiltshire police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information , but their failure to identify , charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country .
this is the face of the main suspect
on the day of the attack , january 24 , about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent .
mr lane said : ` i noticed they parked about 250 yards away .
then five came towards us .
they were looking for trouble -- it was a hardcore element we 'd not seen before .
` they were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face .
a scuffle broke out and i slipped and one started kicking me in the head , stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth .
i was knocked out for a few minutes .
then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar . '
mr lane , who has paid Â£ 500 for dental treatment since the attack , added : ` i feel let down and think the police could have done more . '
karen fieldsend , 42 , who made the call to police , is furious that the case has been dropped .
` it 's disgraceful , ' she said .
` if you had people assaulted in a city centre , something would be done , but in the countryside people forget about it . '
james cameron , 61 , vice-chairman of the tedworth hunt , added : ` their decision is disappointing , but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings . '
the countryside alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice .
last night a spokesman for wiltshire police said : ` we have been unable to move the inquiry further forward .
at this stage the case has been recorded as undetected , however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened . '
