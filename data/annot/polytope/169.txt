Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Jose Mourinho talks to God every day, but never about football.
2. However, in the article, Mourinho is quoted as saying that he only prays for things in his personal life, never about football.
3. This implies that Mourinho does not talk to God about football, which contradicts the summary.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Here's the summary again, with the inconsistency highlighted:

<Summary>
chelsea manager jose mourinho has revealed that he talks to god every day, but never about football and never discusses the game with his wife. 
the 52-year-old father-of-two said he only prays for things in his personal life, never about the game.
</Summary>

In the article, Mourinho says he only prays for things in his personal life, but the summary states that he talks to God every day about football. This is the inconsistency.
