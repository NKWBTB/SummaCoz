    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Mourinho only prays for things in his personal life and never about football, but the article states that he prays every day and only goes to church regularly in Portugal. This implies that he does pray about football-related matters.
2. The summary states that Mourinho never discusses football with his wife, but the article states that he and his family have been privileged to have worked with the World Food Programme as an ambassador against hunger. This suggests that he does discuss football with his wife, as they have worked together on charitable initiatives related to the sport.
3. The summary portrays Mourinho as a devoutly religious person who only prays for personal matters, but the article presents him as a more nuanced figure who is deeply religious but also discusses football with his family and has a strong faith in God that influences his professional life.

Overall, the summary oversimplifies and misrepresents Mourinho's comments about his faith and family life, and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
