</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Alves has been unable to agree a new deal with the club and will leave this summer.
2. The article states that Alves has rejected a three-year contract extension, which was dependent on him taking part in 60% of matches for the club.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Alves rejecting a contract extension or the conditions attached to it.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information as the article. Specifically, it does not mention the reason for Alves' departure from Barcelona, which is the rejection of the contract extension.
5. The summary only mentions that Alves has enjoyed successful years at Barcelona and will leave the club this summer, which is not enough information to accurately summarize the article.
6. The inconsistency between the summary and the article is likely due to the fact that the summary does not provide the full information about the circumstances of Alves' departure from Barcelona, which is the main point of the article.
