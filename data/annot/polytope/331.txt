1. The article states that the French customs officers seized more than 2 tons of cocaine, while the summary only mentions "drugs" without specifying the amount. This inconsistency indicates that the summary is not accurate and does not fully support the information in the article.
2. The article provides the estimated value of the seized drugs as more than $105 million, while the summary does not mention this detail. This inconsistency further supports the conclusion that the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. The article mentions that French customs officials arrested one Venezuelan and two Spanish citizens who were on board the vessel, while the summary only mentions "officers arrested one venezuelan and two spanish citizens" without specifying that they were on board the vessel.
