    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the sailboat was flying an American flag, but the summary claims that the drugs were seized by French authorities. This is inconsistent, as the article states that the seizure was carried out by French customs officers, but the summary implies that the drugs were seized by American authorities.

2. The article states that the drugs are worth more than $105 million, but the summary states that the drugs are the "biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities." This is inconsistent, as the article does not claim that this is the biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities.

3. The article states that one Venezuelan and two Spanish citizens were arrested, but the summary only mentions one Venezuelan. This is inconsistent, as the article states that two Spanish citizens were also arrested.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides more accurate information about the seizure of cocaine and the arrests made.
