</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "bondi's icebergs club pool was drained on thursday to create a unique catwalk for mercedes-benz fashion week australia." However, the article does not mention anything about the pool being drained. Instead, it states that the pool was used as a catwalk setting for the fashion show, but does not mention any draining of the pool.
2. The summary also states "catwalk with a view : crowds gathered to take in the show from the balcony of the iconic club." However, the article does not mention a balcony or any specific viewing area for the crowd. Instead, the article states that the crowd gathered to take in the show from the beach and the break wall.
3. The summary states "walk this way : models paraded through the empty pool and along the break wall in front of a beautiful backdrop of the ocean." However, the article does not mention any models parading through the pool or along the break wall. Instead, the article states that the models walked through the empty pool and along the break wall.
4. The summary states "the collection of ten is designed to be worn in 20 different ways, and are suitable for day to night wear." However, the article does not mention the specific number of pieces in the collection (other than mentioning "ten pieces" in the title) or any information about the clothing being suitable for day to night wear.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that the pool was drained, but the article does not mention any draining. The summary also states that there was a balcony with a view, but the article does not mention any specific viewing area. Additionally, the summary states that the models paraded through the pool and along the break wall, but the article only mentions that they walked through the empty pool and along the break wall. Finally, the summary mentions the clothing being suitable for day to night wear, but the article does not mention this detail.
