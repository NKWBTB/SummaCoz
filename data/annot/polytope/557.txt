    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Based on the given articles, the summary provided is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary states that the woman was arrested after dumping her baby in a rubbish bin, while the article states that the baby was found crying in the ladies' toilet, and the woman was established to be the mother based on CCTV footage and her presence in the toilet for a long time.
2. The summary does not mention the fact that the baby was found wrapped in a shirt and still attached to the umbilical cord and placenta, which is a crucial detail in the article.
3. The summary states that the woman was arrested after being found with the baby, while the article states that the woman was found to have blood on her and was in a trance-like state when approached by staff.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the woman refused to look at her baby or talk to police, which is a significant detail in the article.
5. The summary states that the woman faces charges of neglect, while the article states that she was arrested and faces charges of neglect, but also mentions that she was in shock and traumatized.

Therefore, the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content, and it omits several crucial details that are present in the article.
