Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Number of condos affected: The article states that "ninety condos on the beach in Westhampton were obliterated by flames," while the summary states "ninety condos on the beach in Westhampton were obliterated." The discrepancy is that the article specifically mentions that the condos were "on the beach," while the summary does not include this detail.
2. Location of the fire: The article states that "smoke poured toward the ocean and could be seen from three miles away," while the summary does not mention the location of the fire.
3. Cause of the fire: The article states that "it is not known what started the blaze," while the summary states "it is not known what started the blaze which was so intense it melted the paint off nearby buildings." The discrepancy is that the article does not mention the intensity of the fire in relation to the cause.
4. Time of the fire: The article states that the fire occurred on Wednesday afternoon, while the summary does not mention the specific day of the week or time.
5. Use of the complex: The article states that the Sandpiper complex is "used as a holiday home by residents between May and November," while the summary does not mention the specific use of the complex.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article specifically mentions that the condos were "on the beach," which is not included in the summary.
2. The article states that the fire was so intense that it melted the paint off nearby buildings, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The article does not mention the cause of the fire, while the summary states that it is not known what started the blaze.
4. The article states that the fire occurred on Wednesday afternoon, while the summary does not mention the specific day of the week or time.
5. The article mentions that the Sandpiper complex is used as a holiday home by residents between May and November, which is not included in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it omits several key details and includes some inaccuracies.
