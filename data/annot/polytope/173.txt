1. Inconsistency in the number of condos affected: The summary states that "ninety condos on the beach in Westhampton were obliterated by flames," while the article states that "ninety condos on the beach in Westhampton were destroyed by flames."
2. Inconsistency in the time of the fire: The summary states that the fire occurred on Wednesday afternoon, while the article states that the fire occurred at 3 pm on Wednesday.
3. Inconsistency in the intensity of the fire: The summary states that the fire was "so intense it melted the paint off nearby buildings," while the article states that the fire was "so intense it melted the paint off buildings nearby."
4. Inconsistency in the cause of the fire: The summary does not mention the cause of the fire, while the article states that the fire is being investigated and that there are claims it started near a car parked by the complex.
5. Inconsistency in the use of the word "obliterated": The summary uses the word "obliterated" to describe the condos, while the article uses the word "destroyed."
6. Inconsistency in the wording of the quote from Janice Sklarek: The summary quotes Janice Sklarek as saying "we saw the big black smoke coming off the ocean and couldn't get down here fast enough," while the article quotes her as saying "we saw the big black smoke coming off the ocean and could not get down here fast enough."
7. Inconsistency in the wording of the quote from the building manager: The summary quotes the building manager as saying "we lost everything," while the article quotes him as saying "I have lost everything."
