Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that 12% of people polled thought the child should be named after William's mother, Diana. However, the article states that 12% of people polled thought Diana should be the name for the child if it's a girl. This is not consistent with the summary, which implies that the name should be used regardless of the child's gender.
2. The summary also states that Alice and Charlotte were the next most popular names, with 9% of the vote each. However, the article does not mention these names at all. This is not consistent with the summary, which implies that these names were popular options.
3. The summary states that the majority of Brits are backing William's decision to take six weeks of paternity leave from his pilot job. However, the article does not mention this at all. This is not consistent with the summary, which implies that the leave was a popular decision.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
