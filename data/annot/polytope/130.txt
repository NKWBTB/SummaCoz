    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistency

The summary states that 12% of people polled thought the child should be named after William's mother, Diana, while the article states that 13% of people would like the child to be named James if it's a boy. This is the first inconsistency.

Step 2: Analyze the article

The article states that the majority of Brits are backing William's decision to take six weeks of paternity leave from his pilot job. This information is not present in the summary.

Step 3: Analyze the summary

The summary mentions that Alice and Charlotte were next in terms of preference, getting nine per cent of the vote each. However, the article does not mention this information.

Step 4: Identify the reason for the inconsistency

The inconsistency is likely due to the fact that the summary is based on a specific poll, while the article is a broader overview of the situation. The poll may have asked different questions or had a different sample size, which could account for the inconsistencies.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information presented in the article, and it includes some information that is not present in the article. The inconsistencies are likely due to the fact that the summary is based on a specific poll, while the article is a broader overview of the situation.
