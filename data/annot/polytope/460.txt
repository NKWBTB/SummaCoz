</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Ferguson was flung from his horse in the 4.20 pm race on Thursday morning. However, the article states that the fall occurred during the 4.20 pm race at Wincanton, not on Thursday morning.
2. The summary mentions Ferguson's double somersault fall, but the article does not mention this detail. The article only mentions a fall and a cut on Ferguson's nose.
3. The summary states that Ferguson's fall was watched online, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the fall has made Ferguson an internet sensation, but it does not specify that the fall was watched online.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important details that are present in the article.
