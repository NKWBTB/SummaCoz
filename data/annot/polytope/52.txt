Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Pirlo has established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football and is hugely popular. This is consistent with the article, which states that Pirlo is a highly skilled midfielder and is well-known and popular in the football world.
2. The summary also states that Totti is a Roma legend and Osvaldo feels that he would be just as loved if he moved to Argentina. This is consistent with the article, which states that Totti is a legendary player for Roma and that Osvaldo believes he would be a good fit for Boca Juniors.
3. However, the summary does not mention Osvaldo's urging of Pirlo and Totti to move to Boca Juniors, which is a key point in the article. This is inconsistent with the article, as the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the information about Osvaldo urging Pirlo and Totti to move to Boca Juniors.
