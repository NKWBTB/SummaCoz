    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that pirlo has established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football and is hugely popular. However, the article does not mention anything about pirlo's popularity or status as one of the best midfielders in the world.
2. The summary also states that totti (10) is a roma legend, but the article does not mention totti's status as a roma legend.
3. The summary states that osvaldo believes that pirlo and totti would be a good fit for boca, and that the fans would love to have them line up on the la bombonera pitch. However, the article does not mention osvaldo's beliefs about pirlo and totti being a good fit for boca, or the fans' reaction to them joining the team.
4. The summary states that osvaldo thinks that pirlo and totti should move to boca, but the article does not mention osvaldo's thoughts on the matter.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the text. Specifically, the summary mentions pirlo's popularity and totti's status as a roma legend, which are not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary attributes thoughts and beliefs to osvaldo that are not present in the article.
