     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the five-year-old boy, Mai Zizhuo, is a basketball superstar, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that he is a viral video sensation and that his skills have won him legions of fans across China.
2. The summary uses the words "talented," "skilful," and "praised" to describe Mai Zizhuo, but these words are not found in the article. The article uses the word "incredible" to describe his skills, but it does not use the other words.
3. The summary states that Mai Zizhuo has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, but the article does not mention his age when he started playing basketball.
4. The summary mentions that the video of Mai Zizhuo has stunned netizens in China, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the video has gone viral and that many people have left comments on social media.
5. The summary quotes a netizen named "Lakers fan'siu720'" as saying "I can't believe it... it must be special effects!", but this quote is not found in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates Mai Zizhuo's status as a basketball superstar and uses words that are not found in the article. Additionally, it includes a quote that is not found in the article.
