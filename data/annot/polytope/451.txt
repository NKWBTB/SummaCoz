you can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product , funded through a kickstarter campaign .
leeds-based direct line is running a competition called #everydayfix .
they asked groups to design products to deal with common problems .
these include forgetting to lock the door , which one company hopes to solve with their forget me lock prototype , shown
the products were designed as part of the direct line everyday fix design makeathon .
they asked people to pick their top ten ` everyday emergencies ' - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives .
groups from london-based design company makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist .

* how many people thought this was a problem
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called ` snooze ' , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep .
to deal with not remembering if you had locked your door , onn studio created the forget me lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door .
it fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
this means that even when out or about , you can find out if your door is locked or not .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost .
direct line is running a competition on twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about snooze , forget me lock or nipper .
the forget me lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key .
when the key is turned in a lock it swivels green to show the door is open , and red to signify it 's locked .
another group designed nipper - the world 's smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators , impulse .
any household battery can be used as its energy source , with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost
the nipper device ( shown ) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about
in the survey of 2,000 people , the top emergency was not being able to sleep .
so a group called instruments designed a product called snooze , shown , an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night 's sleep
whichever tweet has the most retweets , with the #everydayfix hashtag , by 32 april will go into a kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development .
` we 've seen the great british designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies , ' said paul smyth , co-founder of makerversity .
` through the direct line everyday fix event , we 've been able to extend our role as " fixers " and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation 's everyday emergencies , ' added john shaw , head of r&d and innovation at direct line .
of the products that did n't make the cut , one was a helmet with ` bone conduction headphones ' that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .
another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space , which would then alert you when the space was free , if you could n't find somewhere to park .
and as another solution to your phone running out of battery , one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies .
products that did n't make the final shortlist included the parking pin , shown .
you could leave this in a parking space , and it will alert you when the space is free , so you can park your car

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies between the two. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions a survey of 2,000 people, but the summary does not mention any survey.

Inconsistency: The article provides evidence from a survey, but the summary does not include any such evidence.

2. The article lists the top emergencies as not being able to sleep, losing keys, being stuck in traffic, etc., but the summary only mentions "everyday emergencies" without providing any specific examples.

Inconsistency: The article provides specific examples of common emergencies, while the summary is too general and does not provide any concrete examples.

3. The article describes the products designed by the groups, including the "forget me lock" and "nipper" devices, but the summary does not mention any specific products.

Inconsistency: The article provides detailed information about the products designed to solve common emergencies, while the summary does not mention any such products.

4. The article mentions that the competition is running on Twitter, and people can vote for their favorite product by retweeting tweets about the products, but the summary does not mention any social media component.

Inconsistency: The article provides information about the competition's social media aspect, while the summary does not include any such information.

5. The article provides quotes from the co-founder of makerversity and the head of R&D and innovation at direct line, but the summary does not include any such quotes.

Inconsistency: The article provides additional context and perspectives from the companies involved, while the summary does not include any such information.

Overall, the summary does not provide the same level of detail and specific examples as the article, and it does not accurately convey the information provided in the article.
