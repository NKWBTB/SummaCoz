    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alice Barker had never seen herself dancing before, but the article states that there were motion pictures made of her and that she had memorabilia. This is inconsistent, as the article suggests that she had seen herself dancing before.
2. The summary states that Mark Cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of "soundies" to show to Alice Barker, but the article states that the video was made up of "early music videos" (i.e. "soundies"). This is inconsistent, as the article does not use the term "soundies".
3. The summary states that Alice Barker had never seen herself actually dancing before, but the article states that she had been a dancer in New York nightspots in the 1930s and 1940s. This is inconsistent, as it suggests that she had seen herself dancing before.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and contradictions.
