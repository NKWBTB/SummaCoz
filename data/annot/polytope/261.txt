</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Conor McGregor has unveiled a new tattoo of a tiger's face on his stomach.
2. However, the article does not mention a tiger tattoo. Instead, it mentions a gorilla eating a heart tattoo on McGregor's chest and a tiger's face tattooed onto his stomach.
3. The article states that McGregor has already had the gorilla eating a heart tattoo inked upon his chest, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The summary does not provide any information about the motivation behind McGregor's new tattoo, while the article mentions that McGregor claims he has greater motivation to win the title than Aldo has to defend it.
5. The summary does not mention the promotional tour in Dublin where McGregor grabbed Aldo's belt and raised it in front of 5,000 home supporters, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information mentioned in the article and includes some information that is not present in the article.
