Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Timing of the arrest: The article states that Muliaina was arrested last night after his team was defeated in the quarter finals of the European Challenge Cup, while the summary only mentions the defeat but does not mention the arrest.
2. Location of the arrest: The article states that Muliaina was arrested at Kingsholm Stadium, while the summary does not mention the location of the arrest.
3. Reason for the arrest: The article states that Muliaina was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault, while the summary only mentions that he was arrested but does not provide any information about the reason for the arrest.
4. Denial of allegations: The article quotes Muliaina's solicitor as saying that he totally denies all the allegations, while the summary does not mention Muliaina's denial.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and accuracy as the article. The summary only provides a brief overview of the events, while the article provides more specific information about the timing, location, and reason for Muliaina's arrest, as well as his denial of the allegations.
