     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that the child's name is "Mai Zizhuo," but the article does not mention a name. The article only refers to the child as "a small boy" or "the pint-sized player."
2. The summary states that the child has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, but the article does not provide that information. According to the article, the child's age is not specified.
3. The summary mentions that the child is a new basketball superstar, but the article does not use that language. Instead, the article states that the child's incredible skills have won him legions of fans across China.
4. The summary quotes a Lakers fan named "Siu720" as saying "I can't believe it...it must be special effects!", but the article does not mention any specific quotes from netizens or fans.
5. The summary mentions that the child's father is unknown, but the article does not provide that information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes specific details that are not present in the article, and it quotes specific individuals and includes specific language that is not found in the article.
