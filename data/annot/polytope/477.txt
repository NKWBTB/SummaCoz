Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "chinese parents called mai zizhuo and he has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old," implying that the child's name is Mai Zizhuo and that he has been playing basketball since a very young age. However, the article does not mention the child's name or age, and only refers to "a small boy" or "the pint-sized player."
2. The summary mentions that "now a new basketball star is on the rise in china," which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the child becoming a star or rising to fame.
3. The summary quotes "lakers fan ` siu720 `" as saying "i can't believe it....... it must be special effects!" However, this quote is not found in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the viral video that the article highlights as the source of the child's fame.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other important details that are mentioned in the article.
