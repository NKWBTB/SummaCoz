     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Eugene was awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships, but the article states that the IAAF Council decided to bypass the usual bidding process and awarded the event to Eugene without a bidding process.
2. The summary mentions that Qatar Capital Doha beat Eugene to host the 2019 event, but the article does not mention any bidding process or awarding of the 2019 event to Doha.
3. The summary quotes IAAF President Lamine Diack as saying that the council made a clear choice on a strategic decision that enables them to take advantage of a unique opportunity that may never arise again, but the article does not contain this quote.
4. The summary mentions that the 2007 World Championships held in Osaka, Japan was also awarded without a bidding process, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains information that is not present in the article and omits information that is present in the article.
