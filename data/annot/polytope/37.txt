Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Eugene in the United States has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships.

2. However, the summary states that Qatar capital Doha, home to the Aspire Dome, beat Eugene to host the 2019 event.

3. The article does not mention anything about Doha hosting the 2019 event. Instead, it states that Doha was awarded the 2019 event, but Eugene failed in its bid to host that event.

4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Doha hosting the 2019 event, which is not supported by the article.

5. The article explains that the IAAF Council decided to bypass the usual bidding process for the 2021 championships because of a "unique strategic opportunity" to host the event in the USA for the first time.

6. The summary does not mention this reason for bypassing the bidding process, which is a significant detail that is supported by the article.

7. Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information about the hosting of the 2019 event and does not include a key detail about the reason for bypassing the bidding process.
