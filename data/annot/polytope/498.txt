    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Mr. Mole will be AP McCoy's last ride in a grade one race at Sandown. However, the article states that Mr. Mole will have six rivals in the grade one celebration chase at Sandown, which implies that Mr. McCoy will ride more than one horse in a grade one race at Sandown.
2. The summary also states that Mr. Mole will be AP McCoy's last ride as a professional jockey, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article states that McCoy's book of rides for his final day as a professional jockey will not be finalized until Friday morning, which suggests that Mr. Mole may not be McCoy's last ride after all.
3. The summary mentions that Special Tiara and Sprinter Sacre will also be in the race, but the article does not mention Special Tiara.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed information about the race and the participants, while the summary is limited to a few key points and contains errors.
