Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Mr. Mole will be AP McCoy's last ride in a grade one race.
2. However, the article states that Mr. Mole will have six rivals in the grade one celebration chase at Sandown on Saturday, which implies that he will be riding in more than one grade one race.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Mr. Mole will be McCoy's last ride in a grade one race is not consistent with the information in the article.
