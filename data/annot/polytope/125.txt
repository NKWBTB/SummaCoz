    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that James Haskell posted an Instagram photo dressed as Robert Downey Jr.'s character Iron Man, but the article does not mention anything about Haskell dressing up as Iron Man.
2. The summary mentions that the movie premiered at Westfield London shopping centre, but the article does not mention the location of the premiere.
3. The summary states that Haskell returned to Wasps for the 2012 season, but the article does not mention the specific season that he returned to the club.
4. The summary mentions that Haskell has played for several teams, including Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams, and Highlanders, but the article does not mention these teams.
5. The summary states that Haskell has surpassed the 100 appearances mark for Wasps, but the article does not mention this achievement.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
