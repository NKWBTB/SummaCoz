</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that James Haskell posted an Instagram photo dressed as Robert Downey Jr.'s character Iron Man. However, the article does not mention anything about Haskell posting a photo dressed as Iron Man.
2. The summary also states that the movie premiered at Westfield London shopping centre on Tuesday evening. However, the article does not mention the movie premiering at Westfield London, and instead states that it premiered at a cinema in London.
3. The summary mentions that fans queued up to see the A-list cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson. However, the article does not mention anything about fans queuing up to see the cast.
4. The summary states that Haskell returned to Wasps for the 2012 season after spells with Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams, and Glasgow. However, the article does not mention anything about Haskell returning to Wasps in 2012, and instead states that he returned to the club where he started his career for the 2012 season.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, Haskell did not post a photo dressed as Iron Man, the movie did not premiere at Westfield London, and there is no mention of fans queuing up to see the cast. Additionally, Haskell did not return to Wasps in 2012, but instead returned to the club where he started his career.
