</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the driver sent the video to the bus company along with a complaint. However, the article states that a passenger filmed the driver and sent the video to the company, not the driver himself.
2. The summary mentions that the driver was flicking through pages of the newspaper while the bus is in motion, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that the driver was reading a newspaper while the bus was slowing down at a set of traffic lights.
3. The summary does not mention the driver's actions being slammed by the boss as "complete idiot" and "bloody irresponsible behavior to the first degree" as stated in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the details of the driver's actions and the reaction of the bus company's boss. The summary leaves out important information and includes some inaccuracies, which can be seen by comparing it to the original article.
