    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the driver sent the video to the bus company along with a complaint. However, the article states that a passenger filmed the driver and sent the video to the bus company along with a complaint. The driver did not send the video.
2. The summary states that the driver was caught reading a newspaper while the bus was in motion. However, the article states that the driver was caught reading a newspaper while the bus was slowing down at a set of traffic lights.
3. The summary does not mention the driver holding the newspaper open over the steering wheel, which is mentioned in the article.
4. The summary quotes the bus company's boss as saying that the driver is a "complete idiot" and that the behavior is "bloody irresponsible." However, the article quotes the boss as saying that the driver's actions are "absolutely stupid" and "irresponsible behavior to the first degree."

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The driver did not send the video, the driver was not caught reading the newspaper while the bus was in motion, and the bus company's boss did not use the word "complete idiot" to describe the driver's actions.
