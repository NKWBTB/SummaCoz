  Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

Step 1: Inconsistency in the name of the person in the summary

Step 2: Inconsistency in the cause of the injury

The summary states that Nina was found with heavy bruises, but the article explains that she collapsed due to low blood pressure. This is an inconsistency in the cause of the injury, as the summary implies that Nina was injured due to physical violence, while the article suggests that her injury was due to a medical condition.
