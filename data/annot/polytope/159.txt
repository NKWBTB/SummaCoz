    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Sarah Wilson "opened up about her own personal battle with mental illness," but the article does not mention "mental illness" explicitly. Instead, it talks about her struggle with anxiety and depression.
2. The summary mentions that Sarah Wilson "came close to taking her own life," but this is not mentioned in the article. The article only states that she felt like she could not see the point of continuing and that she was essentially alone.
3. The summary states that Sarah Wilson "revealed she had reached a stage in her life where she could not see the point of continuing," but the article does not mention this exact phrase. Instead, it quotes her as saying "my anxiety brought me to a point where I could not quite see the existential point of continuing."
4. The summary mentions that Sarah Wilson "struggled through her younger years," but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that she has recently "found some peace with it."
5. The summary mentions that Sarah Wilson "thinks we need to acknowledge the link between depression and anxiety to be better equipped to tackle the increasing rate of Australian women who are being negatively affected by stress and anxiety," but this is not explicitly stated in the article.

Overall, the summary takes some creative liberties with the information in the article, which can make it seem inconsistent with the original content.
