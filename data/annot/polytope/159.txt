</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Sarah Wilson, the author of the best-selling book "I Quit Sugar," opened up about her personal battle with mental illness.

However, the article does not mention "I Quit Sugar" or any book by Sarah Wilson. This is inconsistent, as the summary implies that the article is about Sarah Wilson's book, but the article is actually about her personal struggles with mental illness.

2. The summary states that Sarah Wilson explained how anxiety drove her to believe she had reached a stage in her life where she couldn't see the point of continuing.

However, the article does not contain this exact quote from Sarah Wilson. Instead, the article quotes her as saying that her anxiety brought her to a point where she couldn't quite see the existential point of continuing, and that she couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel.

3. The summary states that one in three Australian women will experience anxiety in their lifetime.

While this is true, it is not directly related to the content of the article. The article focuses on Sarah Wilson's personal struggles with anxiety and does not provide any statistics or information about anxiety rates in Australia.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the article is about Sarah Wilson's book and includes specific quotes that are not present in the article, and it also includes information about anxiety rates in Australia that is not directly related to the content of the article.
