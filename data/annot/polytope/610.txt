Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Lewis Ferguson was flung from his horse in a spectacular fall at Wincanton, and that he was back riding out and undeterred from getting back in the saddle.
2. The summary states that Lewis Ferguson has just a cut on his nose to show for his ordeal.
3. The article does not mention anything about Lewis Ferguson having just a cut on his nose. In fact, it states that he was flung from his horse in a spectacular fall and that he could have been seriously injured.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information in the article. The article mentions a spectacular fall and the possibility of serious injury, but the summary only mentions a cut on the nose.
5. The inconsistency is likely due to the fact that the summary is a brief summary of the article and does not include all of the information in the article. The summary only focuses on one aspect of the article (Lewis Ferguson's injury) and does not provide a complete picture of the situation.
