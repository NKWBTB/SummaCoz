Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary states that prosecutors dropped the charge against Elena Curtin because she was "completely justified in her outrage." However, the article states that the charge was dropped because Curtin was "justified in her outrage" due to the ex-girlfriend's behavior, not because of Curtin's actions.
2. The summary does not mention the fact that the ex-girlfriend was shooting heroin in Curtin's bathroom, which is a significant detail that is mentioned in the article.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the ex-girlfriend had a history of harassing and threatening Curtin, which is mentioned in the article as a reason why Curtin's defense attorney argued that Curtin was justified in using physical force against the ex-girlfriend.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the reasons why the charge against Curtin was dropped and it omits significant details about the ex-girlfriend's behavior that were mentioned in the article.
