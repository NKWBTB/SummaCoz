    ( cnn ) with help from some filmmakers , 102-year-old alice barker went back in time .
barker was a dancer in such new york nightspots as the cotton club and the cafe zanzibar in the 1930s and 1940s , part of chorus lines that entertained alongside notables including bill " bojangles " robinson and frank sinatra .
there were motion pictures made of barker , but she had never seen any of them .
moreover , her photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years .
so she had never seen herself actually dancing -- until now .

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alice Barker was a dancer in New York nightspots such as the Cotton Club and the Cafe Zanzibar in the 1930s and 1940s. This is consistent with the article, which states that she was a dancer in those venues.
2. The summary states that Alice Barker had never seen any motion pictures of herself dancing before, and that her photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years. This is consistent with the article, which states that she had never seen any of her old performances on film before.
3. The summary states that Mark Cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of "soundies" (early music videos) and showed them to Alice Barker at the nursing home where she lives. This is not consistent with the article, which does not mention anything about "soundies" or a video being made.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (the "soundies" video).

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
