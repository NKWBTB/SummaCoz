</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Alice Barker was a dancer in the 1930s and 1940s, and that she had never seen any of her old films or photographs.
2. The summary states that Alice Barker went back in time with the help of some filmmakers.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. If Alice Barker had never seen any of her old films or photographs, then she would not have been able to go back in time and see herself dancing.
4. Therefore, the summary statement about Alice Barker going back in time is not supported by the article.
5. The article does mention that Mark Cantor of jazz-on-film.com and some volunteers put together a video of "soundies" (early music videos) and showed them to Alice Barker at her nursing home, but this is not the same as going back in time.
6. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement about Alice Barker going back in time should be removed.
