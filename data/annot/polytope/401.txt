a leading member of the notorious paedophile information exchange , which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s , has joined the supporters of the media pressure group hacked off .

the organisation , set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal , is campaigning against what it sees as the ` biased and unfair ' independent press standards organisation .
it wants mps to set up a statutory body to regulate the press , as recommended by the leveson inquiry .
the news that o'carroll is a backer of hacked off will be an embarrassment to the group .
pie was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the national council for civil liberties ( nccl ) .
the nccl lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child ` understood the nature of the act ' and apparently consented .
the group also wanted incest to be legalised .
o'carroll was on the nccl 's gay rights sub-committee .
the 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ` corrupting public morals ' .
he wrote a blog after the february meeting , chaired by comedian john cleese , confirming his attendance .
a hacked off spokesman said that the meeting was ` open to and free for all members of the public to attend ' .

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll is a former open university information officer, but the article does not mention this.
2. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that Hacked Off is campaigning against the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll is a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that PIE campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s, but the article does not mention this.
6. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll was jailed in 1981 for "corrupting public morals", but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
