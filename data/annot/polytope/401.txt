</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Tom O'Carroll, a former member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off.

2. However, the summary does not mention O'Carroll's affiliation with PIE or his support for legalizing child sex.

3. The article states that PIE campaigned to legalize child sex in the 1970s and 80s, and that O'Carroll was a leading member of the organization.

4. The summary does not mention any of this information, which is inconsistent with the article.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about Tom O'Carroll's affiliation with PIE and his support for legalizing child sex.

6. The article also states that O'Carroll was jailed in 1981 for "corrupting public morals," which is not mentioned in the summary.

7. Overall, the summary is not a faithful representation of the information provided in the article, and it is not consistent with the article's content.
