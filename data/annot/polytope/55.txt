</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "diana is the favourite name for the second royal baby," but the article does not support this claim. The article mentions that Diana is a popular name choice for a potential baby girl, but it does not say that it is the favourite name overall.
2. The summary says that "the choices were echoed on social media today," but the article does not mention social media. The article only mentions a YouGov survey and does not mention any social media responses.
3. The summary states that "many people are hoping for a girl," but the article does not say this explicitly. The article mentions that a quarter of the people polled by YouGov wanted the duke and duchess of cambridge to have a female baby, but it does not say that this is a widespread hope or expectation.
4. The summary mentions that "only three percent hoping for a younger brother for george," but the article does not say this. The article only mentions that three percent of people polled by YouGov thought that the child should be named after William's father, Prince Charles.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the popularity of the name Diana, misrepresents the article's information about social media, and includes information that is not present in the article.
