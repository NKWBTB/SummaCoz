     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Diana is the favorite name for the second royal baby, while the article states that Diana is the favorite name for a girl.
2. The summary suggests that the name Diana is popular because it is the name of William's mother, while the article explains that the name Diana is popular because it is the name of the Queen's aunt.
3. The summary mentions that many Twitter users would be delighted if Kate and William named the baby after his mother, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that a quarter of the people polled wanted a female baby, while the article states that 12% of people polled thought the child should be named after William's mother.
5. The summary mentions that Alice and Charlotte are also popular names, but the article does not mention this.
6. The summary states that 13% of people would like the name James for a boy, while the article states that 9% of people would like the name Alexander.
7. The summary does not mention the fact that the majority of Brits are backing William's decision to take six weeks paternity leave.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it focuses on the name Diana and the idea that Kate and William should name the baby after William's mother, while the article provides more information about the poll and the preferences of the British public.
