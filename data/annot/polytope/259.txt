</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Corry "Corey" Campbell, 21, is the ringleader of a gang dubbed the "tattoo terrorists."
2. The article states that Campbell and his accomplices tortured and abused Greg Valecce, an unemployed drug addict, for three days in the basement of Campbell's mother's house in Mayfair, Philadelphia.
3. The summary does not mention the torture and abuse of Valecce, instead only stating that Campbell believed Valecce had hurt his cat, Pebbles.
4. The article states that Campbell and his accomplices filmed the abuse, and that the videos were played in court. The summary does not mention the videos or the fact that the abuse was filmed.
5. The article states that Valecce suffered three busted ribs, two broken wrists, and fractured bones in his face as a result of the abuse. The summary does not mention any of these injuries.
6. The article states that the abuse lasted for 42 hours, while the summary does not provide any information about the duration of the abuse.
7. The article states that police found a tattoo gun, needles, ink vials, and related paraphernalia, as well as 155 grams of marijuana, several bottles of prescription drugs, and Valecce's debit card, which he claimed had been stolen from him, during a search of the house. The summary does not mention any of these items.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include any information about the torture and abuse of Valecce, the fact that the abuse was filmed, Valecce's injuries, or the items found during the police search. The summary only provides a brief overview of Campbell's belief that Valecce had hurt his cat, which is not an accurate representation of the events described in the article.
