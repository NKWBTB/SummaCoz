    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Taliban denied responsibility for the attack, but the article does not mention this.

The article states that Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied his group was responsible for the attack, but the summary does not include this information.

2. The summary mentions that the protesters were on their way to join a larger rally against the provincial governor, but the article does not mention this.

The article only states that the protesters were in the city of Khost, but it does not mention anything about a larger rally or the protesters' destination.

3. The summary mentions that the suicide attack hit the group around 10 a.m. local time, but the article does not mention the exact time of the attack.

The article only states that the attack occurred "on Thursday," without providing the exact time.

4. The summary states that 64 people were wounded, but the article only mentions 17 people killed and dozens more wounded.

The article states that "17 people were killed and dozens more were wounded" in the attack, but it does not mention the exact number of wounded.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other information that is present in the article.
