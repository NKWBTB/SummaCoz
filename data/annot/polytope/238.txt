Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Taliban spokesman denied his group was responsible for the attack.
2. However, the article states that no other organization has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
3. This implies that the Taliban did not claim responsibility for the attack, which contradicts the statement in the summary that the Taliban spokesman denied his group was responsible.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it attributes a denial of responsibility to the Taliban that is not supported by the article.
