     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Serena Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets, while the article states that Williams beat Lisicki in a tight three-set match.
2. The summary does not mention the celebratory cake presented to Williams after her 700th career victory, while the article highlights this event.
3. The summary states that Williams will face Simona Halep for a place in the final, while the article states that Halep beat Sloane Stephens to reach the semi-finals.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the match and the events surrounding it.
