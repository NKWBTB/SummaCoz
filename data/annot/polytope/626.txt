a leading member of the notorious paedophile information exchange , which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s , has joined the supporters of the media pressure group hacked off .
tom o'carroll , a former open university information officer and formerly a key activist for pie , attended a hacked off rally in the houses of parliament on february 25 to lobby mps for state involvement in media regulation .
the organisation , set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal , is campaigning against what it sees as the ` biased and unfair ' independent press standards organisation .
it wants mps to set up a statutory body to regulate the press , as recommended by the leveson inquiry .
the news that o'carroll is a backer of hacked off will be an embarrassment to the group .
pie was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the national council for civil liberties ( nccl ) .
the nccl lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child ` understood the nature of the act ' and apparently consented .
the group also wanted incest to be legalised .
o'carroll was on the nccl 's gay rights sub-committee .
the 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ` corrupting public morals ' .
he wrote a blog after the february meeting , chaired by comedian john cleese , confirming his attendance .
a hacked off spokesman said that the meeting was ` open to and free for all members of the public to attend ' .

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help you identify the inconsistency in the summary and the article. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll campaigned to legalize child sex in the 1970s and 80s.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Tom O'Carroll campaigning to legalize child sex. Instead, it states that he was a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which campaigned for sex with children to be legalized.
3. The summary also states that Tom O'Carroll has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off, which is campaigning for state involvement in media regulation.
4. The article does mention that Tom O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25, but it does not say that he has joined the group's supporters.
5. Therefore, the inconsistency between the summary and the article is that the summary states that Tom O'Carroll campaigned to legalize child sex, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that he was a leading member of PIE and attended a Hacked Off rally.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it adds information that is not supported by the text. It is important to carefully read and analyze the information provided in the article to ensure accuracy and avoid misinformation.
