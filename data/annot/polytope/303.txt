    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Gerrard's departure: The summary states that Gerrard is aiming to end his Liverpool career by making the FA Cup final and beating Arsenal, implying that he will leave the club after the final. However, the article states that Gerrard will sign off his Anfield career in the final, which takes place on his birthday of May 30, before moving to LA Galaxy.
2. Skrtel's praise for Gerrard: The summary states that Skrtel has praised Gerrard for his impact and example set during his time at Liverpool. However, the article states that Skrtel believes Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world and that he will be missed next season.
3. Replacement for Gerrard: The summary states that Skrtel believes Liverpool have the players to fill Gerrard's void, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that Skrtel admits that Liverpool will be a different side without Gerrard among their ranks.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that Gerrard will leave Liverpool after the FA Cup final, but the article states that he will sign off his Anfield career before moving to LA Galaxy. Additionally, the summary states that Skrtel believes Liverpool have the players to fill Gerrard's void, but the article does not mention this.
