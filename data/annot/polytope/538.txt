    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Taliban spokesman denied his group's responsibility for the attack.
2. However, the article states that the Taliban spokesman denied his group's responsibility for the attack.
3. This means that the summary and the article are consistent in terms of the Taliban's denial of responsibility.
4. However, the article also states that no other organization has claimed responsibility for the attack, while the summary does not mention this.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the fact that no other organization has claimed responsibility for the attack.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it does not include the fact that no other organization has claimed responsibility for the attack, which is mentioned in the article.
