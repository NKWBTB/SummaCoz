    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Summary: The summary states that Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself when he caused the crash that killed the Vermont couple and their unborn baby.

Inconsistency: However, the article states that Dellinger told investigators he was not suicidal and that he had been arguing with his wife over his medications on the morning of the crash.

2. Summary: The summary mentions that Dellinger broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of the victims.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention Dellinger breaking down in tears.

3. Summary: The summary states that Dellinger pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and faces 12 to 24 years in prison.

Inconsistency: The article states that Dellinger pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and faces 12 to 24 years in prison, but it also mentions that he faces a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the estate of Amanda Murphy.

4. Summary: The summary does not mention the details of Dellinger's background, such as his high-level positions at various companies and his wealth.

Inconsistency: The article provides detailed information about Dellinger's background, including his high-level positions at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp., and General Electric Co., as well as his wealth and the fact that he took a severance package worth more than $1 million in cash plus stocks when he left his last job in 2011 due to health reasons.
