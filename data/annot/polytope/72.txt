Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the drugs have an estimated value of over $105 million, making it the biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities.
2. However, the summary only mentions that the drugs have an estimated value of over $105 million, without mentioning that it is the biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities.
3. The article states that the seizure was made off the coast of Martinique, an overseas department of France.
4. The summary does not mention the location of the seizure.
5. The article mentions that French customs officials seized nearly 250 kilograms (550 pounds) of cocaine on a vessel off the coast of Martinique in November, according to authorities.
6. The summary does not mention this previous seizure.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information as the article, specifically the location of the seizure and the fact that it is the biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities.
