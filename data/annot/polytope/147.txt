Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the cocaine seizure took place off the coast of Martinique, an overseas department of France.
2. The summary states that the seizure took place off the coast of Colombia.

This is inconsistent because Colombia is not mentioned in the article at all. The article only mentions Martinique.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly mentions Colombia instead of Martinique.
