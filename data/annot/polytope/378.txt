    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Steven Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, but the article does not mention this. While the article does quote Martin Skrtel as saying that Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world, this is not a direct quote from Gerrard himself.
2. The summary states that Gerrard is aiming to end his Liverpool career by making the FA Cup final and beating Arsenal, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Gerrard is set to feature for Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley, with the intention of leading his hometown side into the final against Arsenal.
3. The summary states that Skrtel believes Liverpool can overcome the difficult challenge of replacing Gerrard, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article quotes Skrtel as saying that Liverpool will be a different side without Gerrard among their ranks, but does not explicitly state that Skrtel believes the club can overcome the challenge of replacing him.

Overall, the summary takes some creative liberties with the quotes and information from the article, and is not a completely accurate representation of the original text.
