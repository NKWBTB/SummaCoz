    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the 14-year-old girl set herself on fire after being gang-raped, while the article states that she was allegedly gang-raped and then set herself on fire. The word "allegedly" is important here, as it indicates that the events are not confirmed and may not have happened exactly as described.
2. The summary does not mention that the girl is now recovering in the hospital, while the article states that she is in the hospital with 70% burns. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not be up to date or accurate.
3. The summary does not mention the location of the gang rape and the setting of the fire, while the article provides specific details about the location and the circumstances of the attack.
4. The summary does not mention the arrest of the accused men, while the article states that they have been arrested.
5. The summary does not provide any context about the broader issue of sexual assault in India, while the article provides several examples of recent attacks and protests related to the issue.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details, uses different language, and does not provide context about the broader issue. It is possible that the summary was written based on an earlier version of the article or from a different source, which could explain the inconsistencies.
