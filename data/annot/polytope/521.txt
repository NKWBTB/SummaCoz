</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Council awarded the 2021 IAAF World Championships to Eugene, Oregon, USA.

2. The summary does not mention the IAAF Council awarding the championships to Eugene. Instead, it simply states that Eugene has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships.

3. The article explains that the IAAF Council bypassed the usual bidding process to award Eugene the championships because of a "unique strategic opportunity" to host the event in the USA for the first time.

4. The summary does not mention any reason for why Eugene was awarded the championships, nor does it mention that the bidding process was bypassed.

5. The article quotes IAAF President Lamine Diack as saying that the decision to award Eugene the championships was a "clear choice on a strategic decision that enables us to take advantage of a unique opportunity that may never arise again."

6. The summary does not include any quotes from IAAF President Lamine Diack or any other sources.

7. Based on the differences between the article and the summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide the same level of detail as the article, and it does not accurately convey the reasons why Eugene was awarded the 2021 IAAF World Championships.

Therefore, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article.
