    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Eugene in the United States has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships.
2. However, the article states that Eugene failed last November in its bid to host the 2019 event, which was instead awarded to Doha.
3. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Eugene did not host the 2019 event, but the summary states that Eugene has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 event.
4. The article explains that the IAAF Council decided to bypass the usual bidding process for the 2021 event due to a "unique strategic opportunity" to host the championships in the USA for the first time.
5. The article also states that the IAAF Council made a "clear choice" on a strategic decision to grant the championships to Eugene, despite the fact that the city did not host the 2019 event.
6. Therefore, the inconsistency between the summary and the article can be explained by the fact that the IAAF Council made an exception to the usual bidding process in order to host the 2021 event in Eugene, despite Eugene's failure to host the 2019 event.
