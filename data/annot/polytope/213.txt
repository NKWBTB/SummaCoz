Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Inconsistent message: The summary states that Liverpool supporters expect Raheem Sterling to remain at the club this summer, while the article does not provide any such message. Instead, the article focuses on the launch of Liverpool's new home kit and the players' excitement about it.
2. Missing information: The summary does not include any information about the new kit design, the record-breaking £300 million kit deal, or the players' attendance at the launch event. These details are present in the article but not in the summary.
3. Incorrect emphasis: The summary emphasizes Sterling's presence at the launch event, while the article focuses on the entire team's attendance and the launch of the new kit.

To fix the summary, it should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article. Here's a possible revision:
