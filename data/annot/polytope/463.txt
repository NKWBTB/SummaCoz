    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Taliban denied responsibility for the attack.
2. However, the article does not mention the Taliban denying responsibility. In fact, the article states that the Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, did not claim responsibility for the attack.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the Taliban denied responsibility, while the article does not mention any denial of responsibility by the Taliban.
4. The article only mentions that the suicide bomber detonated his explosives near a group of protesters, killing 17 people and wounding dozens more, and that no other organization has so far claimed responsibility for the attack.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate because it includes information that is not supported by the article, specifically the statement that the Taliban denied responsibility for the attack.
