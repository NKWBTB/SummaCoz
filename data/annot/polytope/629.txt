Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Inconsistent information: The summary states that the passenger filmed the bus as it slows to a stop at a set of traffic lights, but the article does not mention anything about the bus slowing down or stopping.
2. Incorrect attribution: The summary incorrectly attributes the statement "passenger filmed the driver and sent video to bus company UNK UNK" to the article. This statement is not present in the article.
3. Lack of detail: The summary lacks detail and only provides a brief summary of the article's content. It does not include any specific information about the driver's actions or the company's response, which are the main points of the article.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content and contains several inconsistencies and errors.
