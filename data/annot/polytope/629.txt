    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the bus driver was "caught reading a newspaper while driving" and that the passenger filmed the driver as the bus slowed to a stop at a set of traffic lights. However, the article does not mention the driver reading a newspaper while driving. Instead, it states that the driver was holding the newspaper open over the steering wheel while the bus was in motion.
2. The summary also states that the passenger sent the video to the bus company, but the article does not mention the passenger sending a video. Instead, it states that the passenger filmed the driver and sent a complaint to the bus company.
3. The summary quotes the bus company's boss, Andrew Ritchie, as saying that the driver was a "complete idiot" and that the driver's actions were "bloody irresponsible behavior to the first degree." However, the article does not quote Mr. Ritchie using these exact words. Instead, it quotes him as saying that he was "absolutely amazed" by the driver's actions and that he was "embarrassed" by the driver's behavior.
4. Finally, the summary states that the driver would be disciplined, but the article does not mention the specific disciplinary action that would be taken.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides a more balanced and accurate account of the events, and it does not sensationalize the driver's actions as much as the summary does.
