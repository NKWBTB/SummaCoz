</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Eden Hazard and Nathan Ake paired up to take on Loic Remy and Willian in Audi's football challenge.
2. The article does not mention any football challenge or competition organized by Audi.
3. The article describes Chelsea players participating in a series of challenges, including shooting balls into the boot of a car and playing football over a makeshift tennis court, but there is no mention of a team-based challenge involving Hazard, Ake, Remy, and Willian.
4. The summary implies that the challenge was a head-to-head competition between the four players, while the article describes a series of challenges that involved all four players together.
5. The article mentions that Willian smashed the wing mirror of one of the cars with a long-range effort, but this is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article describes a series of challenges involving all four players, while the summary implies a head-to-head competition between Hazard and Ake versus Remy and Willian. Additionally, the summary does not mention the car challenges or the wing mirror incident, which are key aspects of the article.
