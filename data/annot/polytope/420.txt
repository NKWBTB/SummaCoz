    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Eden Hazard and Nathan Ake paired up to take on Loic Remy and Willian, but the article does not mention any pairings.

2. The summary mentions that the players were set challenges to sink balls into a convertible Audi's from long range, but the article does not mention any long-range challenges.

3. The summary states that the final challenge involved the players shooting at cars from long range, but the article does not mention any long-range shooting challenges.

4. The summary mentions that Willian smashed the wing mirror off one of the Audi's with a long-range effort, but the article does not mention any damage to the cars.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes elements that are not mentioned in the article, such as pairings and long-range challenges, and omits other important details, such as the fact that the players were shooting at cars from close range and that Willian and Remy redeemed themselves with a shock win.
