4. The article also mentions that the protesters were on their way to join a larger rally against the provincial governor, which is not mentioned in the summary.

5. The summary only mentions the time of the attack (10 a.m. local time) and the number of casualties, but does not provide any additional details about the context or circumstances of the attack, which are included in the article.
