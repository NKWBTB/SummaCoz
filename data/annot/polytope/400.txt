2. The summary mentions that the show took place on an unseasonably warm 28 degrees Celsius day, but the article does not mention the temperature.
3. The summary mentions that the collection is suitable for day to night wear, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that the collection is designed for both men and women.
4. The summary mentions that the show was held at Bondi's Icebergs club, but the article does not mention the location of the show. The article only states that the show was held at an unusual location.
5. The summary mentions that the label had no trouble securing the show-stopping location, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that the label had no trouble securing the location for the show.
