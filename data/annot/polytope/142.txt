</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll, a leading member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off.
2. However, the article states that O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation, but it does not mention him as a member or supporter of the group.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that O'Carroll is a member or supporter of Hacked Off, which is not supported by the article.
4. The article only mentions that O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally, but it does not provide any information about his membership or support for the group.
5. The summary is incorrect in stating that O'Carroll has joined the supporters of Hacked Off, as there is no evidence in the article to support this claim.
6. The article does mention that O'Carroll was a leading member of PIE, which was a controversial group that campaigned for the legalization of child sex in the 1970s and 80s.
7. However, the article does not provide any information about O'Carroll's current involvement with PIE or any other group.
8. Therefore, the summary is not only inconsistent with the article, but it also perpetuates inaccurate information by suggesting that O'Carroll is a member or supporter of Hacked Off.
