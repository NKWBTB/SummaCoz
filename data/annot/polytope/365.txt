     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Partnership with Lille: The summary states that Mouscron had a partnership with Lille, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Mouscron had a partnership with Lille but that partnership is now set to end.
2. Preferred option: The summary states that Chelsea are the preferred option for Mouscron, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Chelsea are in early discussions with Mouscron about a possible partnership.
3. Current league position: The summary states that Mouscron are 13th in the table, two points above the relegation places, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Mouscron are 21st in the table.
4. Players on loan: The summary mentions that Vitesse currently have Chelsea's Josh McEachran, Bertrand Traore, and Wallace on their books, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Vitesse currently have one Chelsea player on loan, midfielder Nemaja Matic.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and it omits information that is present in the article.
