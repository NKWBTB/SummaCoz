Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Cause of the blast: The article states that the blast occurred at an oil storage facility after an oil leak, while the summary only mentions an oil leak without specifying the location or cause.
2. Injuries: The article reports that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, while the summary does not mention any injuries.
3. Toxic chemical spill: The article states that there was no toxic chemical spill, but the summary does not mention this information.

To address these inconsistencies, the summary should be revised to include the following information:

1. Cause of the blast: The summary should specify that the blast occurred at an oil storage facility after an oil leak.
2. Injuries: The summary should include information about the injuries, such as the number of people injured and the nature of their injuries.
3. Toxic chemical spill: The summary should clarify that there was no toxic chemical spill.

Here is a revised summary that addresses these inconsistencies:

The blast occurred at an oil storage facility at a controversial chemical plant in Zhangzhou City, China, after an oil leak. The plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass, and more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze.
