    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the explosion occurred at an oil storage facility after an oil leak, but the article does not mention anything about an oil leak or storage facility. The article only mentions that the explosion occurred at a controversial chemical plant.
2. The summary states that the plant produces paraxylene (PX), but the article does not mention PX as one of the chemicals produced by the plant. Instead, the article mentions that the plant produces a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics.
3. The summary states that local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill, but the article mentions that the blast occurred at an oil storage facility and that there was a huge fire. This suggests that there may have been a toxic chemical spill, even if it is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.
4. The summary states that five out of six people were injured by broken glass, but the article does not mention any injuries or casualties.
5. The summary mentions that the plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, but the article does not mention this.
6. The summary mentions that the plant was slated for Xiamen, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more information about the explosion and the plant than the summary does, and some of the information in the summary is not supported by the article.
