    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Leon Yeaman was killed by a single punch from Phillip Pama, while the article states that Pama allegedly killed Yeaman with one punch. The word "allegedly" is important here, as it indicates that Pama has not been convicted of the crime yet.
2. The summary does not mention that Pama was sleeping at the time of the incident, while the article reveals that Pama was sleeping when Yeaman was making a commotion. This information is important as it suggests that Pama was not looking for a confrontation and was caught off guard.
3. The summary does not mention that Pama's defense lawyer, Bruce Peters, stated that Pama grabbed Yeaman by the hand and hit out blindly. This information is important as it suggests that Pama may have acted in self-defense.
4. The summary states that Pama was granted bail on Friday, while the article states that Pama was granted conditional bail on Friday. Conditional bail means that there are certain conditions that Pama must follow in order to avoid going to jail.
5. The summary does not mention that Yeaman was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music, while the article reveals this information. This information is important as it may help explain why Yeaman and Pama had a disagreement over noise levels.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it leaves out important details and includes inaccurate information. For example, the summary states that Pama killed Yeaman with a single punch, while the article states that Pama allegedly killed Yeaman with one punch. Additionally, the summary does not mention that Pama was sleeping at the time of the incident, which is an important detail that suggests he may have been caught off guard.
