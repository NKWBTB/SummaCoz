</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Leon Yeaman was making a lot of noise in his yard at 9 pm on Thursday night, which is not supported by the article. The article states that Mr. Yeaman was allegedly killed by a single punch from Phillip Pama during a row in front of their homes, but it does not mention anything about Mr. Yeaman making noise.
2. The summary also states that Mr. Pama confronted Mr. Yeaman, which is not entirely accurate. According to the article, Mr. Pama allegedly grabbed Mr. Yeaman by the hand and hit him out "blindly."
3. The summary does not mention the fact that Mr. Pama was sleeping at the time of the incident, which is mentioned in the article.
4. The summary states that Mr. Pama was granted conditional bail on Friday, which is correct. However, the article provides more information about the bail conditions, such as Mr. Pama being required to surrender his passport, observe a curfew, and report to the local police station twice a week.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that Mr. Pama has no history of violence, which is mentioned in the article.
6. The summary does not provide any information about the circumstances leading up to the incident, such as Mr. Yeaman's love of loud music and Mr. Pama's sleep schedule, which are mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the information provided in the article.
