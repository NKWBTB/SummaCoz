  Based on the provided article and summary, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Timing of improvement: The summary states that Bobbi Kristina Brown remains in the same neurological state she has been in for three months, implying that her condition has not improved. However, the article states that her condition has improved, and she has been taken out of a medically induced coma.
2. Tracheostomy: The summary mentions that Bobbi Kristina Brown has a tracheostomy in her throat, which is accurate. However, the article does not mention this detail.
3. Rehabilitation process: The summary does not mention anything about Bobbi Kristina Brown embarking on a rehabilitation process, which is mentioned in the article.
4. Quality of life: The summary does not mention anything about the quality of Bobbi Kristina Brown's life, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article. It only mentions a few details about Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition but omits other important information, such as her improvement, rehabilitation process, and quality of life.
