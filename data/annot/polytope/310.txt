</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Lewis Ferguson was flung from his horse in a spectacular fall at Wincanton, and that he was back riding out and undeterred from getting back in the saddle.
2. The summary states that Ferguson has just a cut on his nose to show for his ordeal, and that he was mucking out as usual.
3. The article describes the fall as a "spectacular double somersault fall" and states that it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online.
4. The summary does not mention the word "spectacular" or "double somersault" to describe the fall.
5. The article states that Ferguson was flung from his horse, indicating that the fall was unintentional and not something he could have avoided.
6. The summary does not mention the word "flung" or any language suggesting that the fall was unintentional.
7. The article includes quotes from Ferguson himself, who describes the fall as "a blur" and says he couldn't work out what had happened until he watched the replay.
8. The summary does not include any quotes from Ferguson.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary downplays the severity of the fall and does not accurately convey the details of the incident as described in the article.
