Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. The summary states that Tom O'Carroll is a "leading member" of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), while the article does not mention any leadership role. The article only states that O'Carroll was a "key activist" for PIE.
2. The summary states that PIE campaigned to legalize child sex in the 1970s and 80s, while the article does not mention any specific campaign to legalize child sex. Instead, the article states that PIE campaigned for sex with children to be legalized and formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) to lobby for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten.
3. The summary does not mention O'Carroll's conviction for "corrupting public morals" in 1981, which is mentioned in the article.
4. The summary states that O'Carroll attended a hacked off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation, which is consistent with the article.

Based on these inconsistencies, it can be concluded that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary presents a more positive portrayal of Tom O'Carroll and PIE, while the article provides more details about O'Carroll's background and PIE's controversial activities.
