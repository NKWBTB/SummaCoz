Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Dani Alves has been unable to agree a new deal with the Catalan club, which is consistent with the article.
2. However, the summary does not mention the reason for Alves' inability to agree a new deal, which is the central point of the article. The article states that Alves has rejected the club's final contract offer and that negotiations are over.
3. The summary also does not mention the length of the contract offer or the fact that Alves has been linked with other clubs, which are important details in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and context as the article. It only mentions a few facts that are present in the article, but does not convey the full story.
