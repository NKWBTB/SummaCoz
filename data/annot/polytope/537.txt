    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Dani Alves keeps a close eye on Almeria midfielder Edgar Mendez, but the article does not mention anything about Alves watching Mendez or having any interest in him.
2. The summary states that Alves has been unable to agree a new deal with the Catalan club, but the article states that Alves has rejected the club's final contract offer and will leave the Nou Camp this summer.
3. The summary does not mention that Alves has rejected a three-year contract extension, which is a key point in the article.
4. The summary does not mention that Alves' agent and ex-wife, Dinorah Santana, has confirmed that the right-back had rejected a three-year deal, which is also a key point in the article.
5. The summary does not mention that Alves has been linked with several clubs, including Manchester United and Manchester City, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and is therefore not consistent with it.
