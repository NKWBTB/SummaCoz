    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Conor McGregor has unveiled a new tattoo of a tiger on his stomach, but the article does not mention any new tattoos. The article only mentions a gorilla eating a heart tattoo on McGregor's chest, which was previously reported.
2. The summary claims that McGregor has greater motivation to win the title than Aldo has to defend it for the eighth time, but the article does not provide any quotes or statements from McGregor to support this claim. In fact, the article states that Aldo has been training hard and is determined to defend his title.
3. The summary mentions that McGregor grabbed Aldo's belt during a promotional tour in Dublin, but the article does not mention this event. The article only mentions that the pair have a fractious relationship and that McGregor has been training hard for the upcoming fight.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article and omits other important details that are mentioned in the article.
