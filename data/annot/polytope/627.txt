2. The summary mentions that the child is five years old, but the article does not provide his age.
3. The summary states that the child has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, but the article does not mention this.

5. The summary states that the child's incredible skills have won him legions of fans across basketball-mad china, but the article does not mention any specific fans or reactions to the video.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other details that are mentioned in the article.
