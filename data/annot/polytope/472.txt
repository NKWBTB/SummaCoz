Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the YouTube user, Lionel Hutz, filmed his young son chasing the family feline around the garden in a bid to get some rest. This is consistent with the article.
2. The summary then states that footage shows the cat licking his fur before his human friend comes along and plonks himself on top. This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention the cat licking its fur.
3. The summary then states that the boy proceeds to follow the pet to his new location. This is consistent with the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (the cat licking its fur).
