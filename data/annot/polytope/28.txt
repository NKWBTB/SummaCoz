</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary only lists three airports, while the article provides a list of 10 airports with the highest landing fees.
2. The summary only includes airports in Japan, while the article includes airports from different countries.
3. The summary does not provide the correct landing fees for the airports listed. For example, Haneda Airport's landing fee is £4,559, not £6,850 as stated in the summary.

To fix the summary, it should include all the airports listed in the article, provide the correct landing fees for each airport, and include airports from different countries. Here's an updated summary that is consistent with the article:

"According to the article, the most expensive airports for landing fees are:

1. Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan: £4,559 ($6,850)
2. Narita International Airport in Tokyo, Japan: £3,728 ($5,600)
3. Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan: £3,594 ($5,400)
4. Dublin Airport in Dublin, Ireland: £2,729 ($4,100)
5. La Guardia Airport in New York, USA: £2,630 ($3,950)
6. Salzburg Airport in Salzburg, Austria: £2,530 ($3,800)
7. Toronto Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Canada: £2,461 ($3,600)

9. Chūbu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya, Japan: £2,863 ($4,300)
10. Dubai International Airport in Dubai, UAE: £2,729 ($4,100)
