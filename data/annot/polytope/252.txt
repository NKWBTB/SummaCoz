    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the five-year-old child, Mai Zizhuo, is a basketball superstar, but the article does not use that language. Instead, it describes him as a "pint-sized player" with "incredible skills."
2. The summary mentions that Mai Zizhuo has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, but the article does not provide that information.
3. The summary states that the video of Mai Zizhuo's basketball skills has won him legions of fans across China, but the article does not mention the video.
4. The summary includes a quote from a netizen who says "i want to reincarnate and start over again," but the article does not include that quote.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates Mai Zizhuo's skills and adds information that is not present in the article. The article presents Mai Zizhuo as a talented young basketball player, but the summary presents him as a superstar. Additionally, the summary includes quotes from netizens that are not present in the article.
