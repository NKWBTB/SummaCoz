</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Marco Rubio believes people are born with a sexual preference, but the article does not mention this.

In the article, Rubio says that he believes people are born with a certain sexual orientation, but he does not explicitly state that people are born with a sexual preference.

2. The summary implies that Rubio is in favor of same-sex marriage, but the article states the opposite.

The article quotes Rubio as saying that he does not believe same-sex marriage is a constitutional right and that he believes the definition of marriage should be between one man and one woman.

3. The summary does not mention Rubio's stance on divorce, which is mentioned in the article.

The article states that Rubio, as a Catholic, believes divorce is wrong, but he would not stop loving someone if they were divorced.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It misrepresents Rubio's stance on same-sex marriage and omits important information about his beliefs on divorce.
