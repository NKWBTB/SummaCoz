    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Mohammed Abu Khdeir's name appeared on the wall at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl, but the article states that his name was removed from the memorial wall following his family's complaints.
2. The summary does not mention that Abu Khdeir's family objected to his inclusion on the memorial wall, and that they do not consider him a terror victim. The article states that Abu Khdeir's father, Hussein, said that he refused for his son's name to be listed between soldiers of the occupation, and that Almagor, an organization that works on behalf of victims of terror in Israel, also opposes Abu Khdeir's inclusion on the memorial.
3. The summary does not mention that Almagor wrote a letter to the National Insurance Institute of Israel demanding that Abu Khdeir's name be removed from the memorial wall, and that if his name is not taken off, members of Almagor want their own family members' names removed.
4. The summary does not mention that the National Insurance Institute of Israel will remove Abu Khdeir's name from the memorial following his father's complaints, as reported by Israel radio.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events and opinions mentioned in the article.
