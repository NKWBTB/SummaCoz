    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Carlos Toro is facing deportation after working for the DEA for 27 years, but the article states that he has already retired and is living in the US illegally.
2. The summary mentions that Toro helped carry out undercover stings around the world, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it focuses on his work as an informant and the fact that he is living in the US illegally.
3. The summary states that Toro is facing deportation because he is an immigrant and has been living in the US illegally, but the article does not mention this as the reason for his deportation. Instead, it suggests that the DEA's refusal to help him with his citizenship after he went public with his plight is the reason.
4. The summary states that Toro is "technically living in the US illegally" after declining health forced him to retire, but the article does not use this phrase. Instead, it states that he is living in the US illegally because he does not have a green card or passport.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that Toro's fears of being sent back to Colombia and being killed are based on his work as an informant and the fact that he helped prosecute high-profile drug traffickers. The article highlights this information as a reason why his deportation would be dangerous for him.

Overall, the summary does not accurately convey the information in the article and is not consistent with the details provided.
