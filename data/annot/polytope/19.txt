</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Length of service: The summary states that Carlos Toro worked for the DEA for 27 years, while the article states that he worked for the DEA for 27 years after spending the last 27 years working for the DEA as an undercover operative. This implies that the summary is only referring to the length of time Toro spent as an undercover operative, rather than his total length of service with the DEA.
2. Reason for deportation: The summary states that Toro is facing deportation, but the article explains that this is because he declined health forced him to retire and the DEA refused to help him with his citizenship. The summary does not mention the reason for his deportation.
3. Fear of deportation: The summary states that Toro is "facing deportation," while the article quotes him as saying "if i am sent back to colombia, i would be dead within the first four hours." This suggests that Toro is not just facing deportation, but is also fearful for his life if he is deported.
4. Citizenship promise: The summary does not mention the promise of US citizenship that was made to Toro for his work as an informant, while the article highlights this as a key aspect of his situation.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete or accurate picture of the article's content. It omits key details, such as the reason for Toro's deportation and the promise of US citizenship, and presents information that is not consistent with the article.
