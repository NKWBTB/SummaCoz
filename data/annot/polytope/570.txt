    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions Hazard and Ake going head-to-head in the boot of a car, but the article does not mention anything about the boot of a car. Instead, the article states that the players were challenged to sink balls into the convertible Audi's from long range.
2. The summary mentions Hazard and Ake securing the points with a 5-3 win, but the article does not mention any scores or winners. Instead, the article states that the Chelsea players were set challenges to sink balls into the convertible Audi's from long range and that Hazard and Ake won the decider to take a 6-0 lead after the first two rounds.
3. The summary mentions the players shooting at cars from long range, but the article does not mention anything about shooting at cars. Instead, the article states that the players were challenged to sink balls into the convertible Audi's from long range.
4. The summary mentions Willian smashing the wing mirror off one of the Audi's with a long-range effort, but the article does not mention anything about Willian smashing the wing mirror or any damage to the cars.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains details that are not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.
