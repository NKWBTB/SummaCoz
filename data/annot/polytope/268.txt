</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Arsenal and Liverpool fans left their seats empty at the Emirates Stadium, but the article does not mention anything about empty seats.
2. The summary mentions that protesters hope the image of empty seats will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs, but the article does not mention anything about raising awareness or empty seats.
3. The summary states that supporters from both clubs say they are "disgusted" at the continuing rise of ticket prices, but the article only quotes one person from Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement and does not mention any quotes from Liverpool supporters.
4. The summary does not mention the protesters' demands for tangible reductions in ticket prices or the fact that away fans have to pay extortionate prices.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it does not accurately reflect the content or the main points of the article. The summary is too general and does not provide specific details about the protest or the supporters' demands, while the article provides more specific information and quotes from the protesters.
