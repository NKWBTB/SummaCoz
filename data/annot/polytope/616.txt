` any weather that strikes up north is of concern to us , especially considering the devastation from the storm that hit last week , ' ms wills told daily mail australia .
` any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again , and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted . '
ms wills said the ses was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the hunter region , which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm .
` that 's our focus - the hunter region - because they 've been smashed , ' she said .
` we really are quite concerned about that particular area .
` we are urging the community to prepare themselves , prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation . '
weatherzone meteorologist kim westcott said a trough of low pressure was forming along the coast , and would hit heaviest in the far northern parts of the state .

` it looks like we could get an east coast low later on this week , but it is certainly a different kettle of fish than we 've seen last week , ' ms westcott said .
` the difference is that it is a little bit further away from the coast and it is in a different area - so the heavy rain is probably not going to be over sydney . '
ms westcott said the weather system appeared to be moving quickly .
` we might get two days of rain but it 's not likely to be the same three days of wind and rain we saw last week , ' she said .
damage and destruction caused by flooding in stroud in the nsw hunter region
bureau of meteorology nsw regional director barry hanstrum said : ` early indications suggest the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the states north east including the northern rivers and mid north coasts , with heavy falls also likely for southeast queensland .
` current guidance suggests that rain will increase this week , and peak between thursday and saturday .
` further rainfall is likely for catchments that have already experienced flooding during last week 's severe weather event . '
the bureau of meteorology said it was too early to tell how severe the weather system would be .
ms wills said the ses would spend the next few days trying to complete as many jobs as possible , as well as warning people to prepare their homes should another severe storm hit .
` obviously we 're trying to get through has many as we can before next system hits , ' she said .
ms wills said there were over 1000 personnel in the field across nsw , including 200 from other states such as queensland , victoria , the act and south australia .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the State Emergency Service (SES) was deluged with calls for assistance last week, but the article states that the SES has more than 4,000 jobs from the 24,196 requests still to be completed. This implies that the SES has not completed all of the requests for assistance from last week's wild weather, which is not consistent with the summary.
2. The article states that another storm is predicted to hit the region this week, with heavy rain possible from Thursday, but the summary does not mention this. This is a significant piece of information that is not included in the summary, which is not consistent.
3. The article provides details about the expected impact of the storm, including the possibility of flooding and damage, but the summary does not provide any information about the expected impact. This is not consistent, as the summary should provide a brief overview of the article's content, including the expected impact of the storm.
4. The article provides information about the location of the storm and the areas that are expected to be affected, but the summary does not mention this. The article states that the storm is expected to hit the northern parts of the state, particularly the Hunter region, but the summary does not provide any information about the location of the storm. This is not consistent.
5. The article provides information about the severity of the storm and the potential for flooding and damage, but the summary does not mention this. The article states that the storm is expected to be severe and that there is a concern about the effect of more wild weather on the hard-hit Hunter region, but the summary does not provide any information about the severity of the storm or the potential for flooding and damage. This is not consistent.

Overall, the summary does not provide a consistent overview of the article's content, as it does not include important information about the expected impact of the storm, the location of the storm, and the severity of the storm.
