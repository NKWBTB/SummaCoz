</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Amir Khan enjoyed a family trip to a safari park in northern California. However, the article does not mention anything about a family trip or a safari park.
2. The summary mentions that Khan enjoyed a day at the safari park with his family, but the article does not mention any details about Khan spending a day at the park.
3. The summary states that Khan had come under increasing pressure to take on British rival Kell Brook in June, but the article does not mention anything about this pressure or any potential fight against Brook.
4. The summary mentions that Khan had been linked to bouts against Adrien Broner and Keith Thurman, but the article does not mention anything about these potential fights.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as a family trip to a safari park and pressure to fight Kell Brook. Additionally, the summary omits other important details that are present in the article, such as Khan's next fight being against Chris Algieri.
