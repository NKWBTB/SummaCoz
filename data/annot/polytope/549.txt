    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Amir Khan enjoyed a family trip to a safari park in northern California, but the article does not mention anything about a family trip or a safari park.

Step 2: The summary mentions that Khan posed alongside a rare white tiger, fed giraffes, and sea lions, but the article does not mention these activities.

Step 3: The summary states that Khan was joined by his wife and daughter, but the article only mentions his wife, Faryal Makhdoom Khan.

Step 4: The summary mentions that Khan ended speculation over his next opponent by announcing he will fight former light-welterweight world champion Chris Algieri on May 30, but the article does not mention this information.

Step 5: The summary states that Khan had come under increasing pressure to take on British rival Kell Brook in June, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as the family trip, the exotic animals, and the specific opponent for Khan's next fight.
