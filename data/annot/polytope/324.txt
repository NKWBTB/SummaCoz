    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Amir Khan spent his Friday alongside "some fellow natural born fighters," while the article does not mention anything about other fighters.
2. The summary mentions a "safari park in northern California," while the article only mentions a "safari park" without specifying the location.
3. The summary states that Khan "posed alongside" a white tiger, while the article only mentions that he "fed" a rare white tiger.
4. The summary mentions that Khan's next opponent is Chris Algieri, but the article states that he will fight former light-welterweight world champion Chris Algieri on May 30, which is not the same as saying that Chris Algieri is his next opponent.
5. The summary does not mention Khan's wife and daughter, who are mentioned in the article as joining him on the family trip to the safari park.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important details that are present in the article.
