</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Amir Khan will fight Chris Algieri on May 30, but the article does not mention anything about a fight against Chris Algieri.
2. The summary states that Khan had come under increasing pressure to take on British rival and IBF welterweight champion Kell Brook in June, but the article does not mention anything about Kell Brook or a potential fight against him.
3. The summary states that Khan posed alongside and fed a rare but dangerous white tiger, but the article does not mention anything about a white tiger or Khan posing with one.
4. The summary states that Khan enjoyed a family day at the adventure park with his wife and daughter, but the article does not mention anything about a family trip or a safari park.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as a fight against Chris Algieri, and omits information that is present in the article, such as Khan's family trip to a safari park.
