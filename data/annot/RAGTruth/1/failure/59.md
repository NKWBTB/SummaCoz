Premise:
Getting caught napping on the job is never good.  Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. "There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around," he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. "All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear," Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. "At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint," Jamie Davis said.  "That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us." As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. "At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known," said Troi Ge.  "He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. "We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did," Collins said. "When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane." "I think it's scary and really unsafe, too," Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. "Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. "During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home," the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.


Hypothesis:
An Alaska Airlines flight returned to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport shortly after takeoff due to a person trapped in the cargo hold. The pilot reported hearing banging coming from the cargo hold, and air traffic control was informed. It was discovered that a ramp agent employed by Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines, had fallen asleep in the cargo hold. All ramp employees possess security badges and undergo thorough background checks. No danger was present, and the individual was safe. The plane carried 170 passengers and six crew members and eventually arrived in Los Angeles after a brief delay.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true. 
- The hypothesis states that the Alaska Airlines flight returned to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport shortly after takeoff due to a person trapped in the cargo hold. However, the premise does not mention anything about the plane returning to the airport. Instead, it states that the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold, and air traffic control was informed. The premise also mentions that the banging came from a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, who had fallen asleep. The hypothesis does not mention anything about the pilot reporting hearing banging coming from the cargo hold, or that the pilot reported the banging to air traffic control. The hypothesis also does not mention that the ramp agent was safe and that the plane eventually arrived in Los Angeles after a brief delay. Therefore, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it inaccurately describes the events and does not accurately reflect the information provided in the premise.
