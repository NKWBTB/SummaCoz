'Big Brother 25' Spoilers: The House Wants Cameron Gone, But Will Bowie Jane Take A Shot?
Big Brother 25 (BB25) spoilers tease that the house wants the new Head of Household, Bowie Jane, to backdoor Cameron Hardin. Big Brother Network reports that the houseguests feel that Cameron is a competition beast, and unless they get rid of him now, he could win the game.
Matt Klotz and Jag Bains are aligned with Cameron as "The Fugitives." But Jag thinks that Cameron is a dangerous player and needs to be the next one to leave the house. Bowie is not convinced. She put Felica Cannon and Cirie Fields on the block. She doesn't care which one goes, as both threaten her game.
Cameron wants Bowie to backdoor Cory Wurtrnberger, as he is the biggest threat to Cam's game. While Bowie agrees it is time for Cory to leave, she hesitates to take a shot at him.
Big Brother 25 spoilers say that Cory approached Bowie about backdooring Cameron. He says that Cameron will win his way to the final two if they don't take a shot to remove him. Bowie flat-out stated that she's not interested in naming Comeron as a replacement nominee this week. But Cory will likely keep trying to convince her.
This week's Power of Veto players are Bowie, Felica, Cirie, Jag, Matt, and America. Cory is hosting the competition.
The nominations will stay the same if Bowie, Jag, or Matt wins the POV. Bowie must name a replacement nominee if America Lopez, Cirie, or Felica wins. If that happens, she could take a shot at Cory. The Power of Veto competition is held on Saturday evening.
BB25 fans, will Bowie take a shot at Cory or Cameron if the POV is used this week? Keep watching Big Brother 25 (BB25), airing Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday on CBS and streaming on Paramount Plus.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true. 
- The hypothesis states that "Cory approaches Bowie about backdooring Cameron, but Bowie declines." This statement is inconsistent with the premise for several reasons: 1. The premise does not mention Bowie declining to backdoor Cameron. Instead, it states that Bowie is unsure about backdooring Cameron, but she agrees that Cory is the biggest threat to Cam's game. 2. The premise states that Cameron wants Bowie to backdoor Cory Wurtrnberger, but Bowie hesitates to take a shot at him. 3. The premise mentions that Bowie flat-out stated that she's not interested in naming Comeron as a replacement nominee this week. 4. The premise also mentions that Bowie must name a replacement nominee if America Lopez, Cirie, Jag, Matt, or America wins the Power of Veto competition. 5. The premise also mentions that the Power of Veto competition will determine who stays on the block, but it does not state that Bowie will take a shot at Cory or Cameron if the POV is used this week. In conclusion, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it inaccurately portrays Bowie's hesitation to backdoor Cameron, misrepresents her hesitation to backdoor Cory, and incorrectly states that Bowie declines to backdoor Cameron.
