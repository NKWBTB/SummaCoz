Premise:
It's not easy being the Pope. Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country. As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat? This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma. First, the back story:. One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism. A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a "genocide." (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides. For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question. John Paul II used the "g" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings "a great evil" and "terrible persecution" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.) As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word "genocide." He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document. "In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies," Francis said. "The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people." The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul. In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins. "The Vatican and the papacy love continuity," said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter. If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said. At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday. "The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it," Reese said of the Armenian murders. "He's telling people: There's nothing new here." New or not, Turkey was not happy. The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for "consultations" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word "unacceptable" and "out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis." "Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations," the tweet reads. "Hatred" and "animosity" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis. Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different. He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.) But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the "Mexicanization" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch. On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his "genocide" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had. "We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard," Francis said. CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.


Hypothesis:
Pope Francis held a special Mass on Sunday to commemorate the Armenian genocide of 1915 and referred to the massacre as the "first genocide of the 20th century". The Pope's comments angered Turkey, which has always denied that the deaths of up to 1.5 million Armenians constituted genocide. The Turkish government responded by recalling its ambassador to the Vatican and calling the Pope's comments "unacceptable" and "out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis". **Pope Francis is the first Pope to publicly use the word "genocide" in connection with the Armenian massacre**. His two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both avoided using the term, despite acknowledging the scale of the tragedy. Francis' comments were made in the presence of Armenia's President and may be seen as a change in the Catholic Church's policy towards the issue.

Generated_reasoning:
Yes, the hypothesis is true. 
- The hypothesis states that Pope Francis held a special Mass on Sunday to commemorate the Armenian genocide of 1915 and referred to the massacre as the "first genocide of the 20th century". 
- The hypothesis mentions that the Pope's comments angered Turkey, which has always denied that the deaths of up to 1.5 million Armenians constituted genocide. 
- The hypothesis states that the Turkish government responded by recalling its ambassador to the Vatican and calling the Pope's comments "unacceptable" and "out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis". 
- The hypothesis mentions that Francis' comments were made in the presence of Armenia's President and may be seen as a change in the Catholic Church's policy towards the issue. 
- The hypothesis is consistent with the premise in that it mentions that Pope Francis held a special Mass on Sunday to commemorate the Armenian genocide of 1915 and referred to the massacre as the "first genocide of the 20th century". The hypothesis also mentions that the Turkish government responded by recalling its ambassador to the Vatican and calling the Pope's comments "unacceptable" and "out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis". However, the premise does not mention that Francis' comments were made in the presence of Armenia's President. Instead, it mentions that Francis quoted John Paul II's document, which is a different event than the Mass mentioned in the hypothesis. The premise also mentions that Turkey recalled its ambassador for "consultations" just hours after Francis' comments, which is not mentioned in the hypothesis. The hypothesis's claim that Francis is the first Pope to publicly use the word "genocide" in connection with the Armenian massacre is not supported by the premise. The premise does not mention that Francis is the first Pope to publicly use the word "genocide" in connection with the Armenian massacre. Instead, it states that Francis quoted John Paul II's document, which is consistent with the premise's content. The hypothesis's claim that Francis' comments were made in the presence of Armenia's President is not supported by the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it inaccurately describes the events and the comments made by Pope Francis, it incorrectly attributes the comments to Francis, and it incorrect
