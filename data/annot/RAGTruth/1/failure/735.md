Premise:
Wardi McDonald, 34: Last Seen By Her Siblings In 2001
This is another “one-sentence” case that has been on the books for over 20 years. When I say “one sentence,” I mean that in any report I could find, there is only one sentence to explain the case's circumstances. There are thousands of these within databases, especially those involving Black women, as details are either unknown or the authorities haven’t shared any information that could help with the investigation. The story of Wardi McDonald reads like several others, as she vanished from Detroit, Michigan, on February 1, 2001.
It has already been established that it isn’t much known about this case, but it has been shared that the 34-year-old’s siblings were the last to see her. Where she was, who she may have been with, if she was traveling to or from another location, or any information about her personal or professional life remains a mystery. Sadly, nothing has been revealed about Wardi besides her physical attributes that could help her identify.
Wardi is listed as an endangered missing person, but it is also unclear why the police decided on that classification.
At the time of her disappearance, Wardi McDonald stood 5 feet 3 to 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 120 to 130 pounds. She had brown hair with red/auburn tint kept short, and brown eyes. What she was last seen wearing is unknown. She reportedly has a mole on her nose and burns on half of her back. Wardi’s nickname is “Jackie,” and her middle name is “Jemilla.” Her dental records, fingerprints, and DNA are unknown. She would be 56 years old at the time of this publication.
Anyone with information about this case is urged to contact the Detroit Police Department at (313) 596-1800 or their local authorities. The agency case number is 1109260130.
Please share this story about Wardi McDonald to help reignite interest in her missing person case. She is our sister, and her life matters.
