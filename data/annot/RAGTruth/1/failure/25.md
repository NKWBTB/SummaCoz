Premise:
Their relationship led to jail time for her, but Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau wants the world to know that she and her husband, Vili Fualaau, are still happily together. She was a married 34-year-old teacher and mother of four in Seattle in 1996 when she began an affair with Fualaau, her 13-year-old student. Letourneau gave birth to her young lover's child and went on to serve more than seven years in prison on charges related to their sexual relationship. On Friday, ABC's "20/20" will air an exclusive interview with the couple, who will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary on May 20. The pair wed soon after she was released from prison in 2005 and are now the parents of two teen girls. According to ABC, during the interview with Barbara Walters, "Mary Kay tells Walters what makes their marriage work in spite of their huge difference in their age." "She also discusses her surprising plans to teach again, as well as her intentions to have her status as a registered sex offender lifted," a posting on the network's site says. "Vili Fualaau, meanwhile, discusses his bouts with alcoholism, depression and why he believes the system failed him while he was still a minor." Letourneau Fualaau is now 53, and her husband is 31.


Hypothesis:
Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau, who gained infamy for her relationship with her 13-year-old student, is still happily married to Vili Fualaau. After serving over seven years in prison, they have been married for 10 years and have two teenage daughters. In an upcoming interview with Barbara Walters, Letourneau Fualaau discusses their marriage, her plans to teach again, and **her desire** to have her status as a registered sex offender lifted. Fualaau talks about his struggles with alcoholism, depression, and feeling failed by the system.
