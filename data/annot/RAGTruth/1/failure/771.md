JetBlue Cuts 14 Routes from Major Hubs
JetBlue enthusiasts should be aware of the new flight schedule changes, particularly in the Northeast region. Starting in January and continuing into March, JetBlue is cutting 14 routes from its service. The most affected cities are New York and Boston, with the majority of the discontinued routes involving John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports, as well as Boston Logan International Airport. Los Angeles International Airport is also impacted.

- Boston Logan International Airport–Newark Liberty International Airport
