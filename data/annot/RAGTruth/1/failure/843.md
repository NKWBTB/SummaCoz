California Drug Kingpin Sentenced to Life in Prison for Meth Conspiracies in Oklahoma and Missouri
In a significant victory against drug trafficking, Luis Alfredo Jacobo, a California drug kingpin, has been sentenced to four life terms in federal prison. U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour handed down this severe punishment, including one life sentence for directing a continuing criminal enterprise and three additional life sentences for drug conspiracy. Jacobo was also sentenced to four years on 21 counts of unlawful use of a communication facility, with all sentences to be served concurrently.
Jacobo, based in Bakersfield, California, orchestrated and directed multiple methamphetamine conspiracies that spanned Oklahoma and Missouri for over five years. His operations involved coordinating with more than a dozen individuals in California, Northeast Oklahoma, and Southwest Missouri.
Using Mexican sources of supply, Jacobo managed the distribution of methamphetamine, controlling pricing, methods of delivery, and payments. From 2016 to 2021, he received bulk shipments of meth in California and oversaw the transportation of the drugs to Oklahoma and Missouri, sometimes in quantities as large as 200 pounds. Cash proceeds were sent back to California, either driven by co-conspirators or mailed in sums of up to $100,000 from Oklahoma.
Three distinct drug conspiracies were operated by Jacobo's regional managers in Oklahoma, each selling methamphetamine under his direction. Numerous pieces of evidence, including communications and money exchanges related to the conspiracies, were presented during the trial, along with evidence from executed search warrants.
One significant discovery came when law enforcement uncovered 231 pounds of methamphetamine and over $465,000 in a storage unit in Grove, Oklahoma, in 2020. The storage unit was rented for Jacobo to store meth for distribution. In addition, officers arrested a codefendant, Tony Garcia, who was carrying 30 pounds of meth and a loaded handgun in Oklahoma City. Text messages on Garcia's phone indicated that he received instructions from Jacobo on the meth distribution.
Jacobo's conviction was the result of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Operation "Pullin Chains," led by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration. This operation targeted high-level drug traffickers and criminal organizations, employing a multi-agency approach to disrupt and dismantle these networks.
