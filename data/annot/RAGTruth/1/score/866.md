'Bold and the Beautiful' Spoilers: Luna Leaks Eric's Secret To Ridge, RJ Betrayed By His New Love?
The Bold and the Beautiful (B&B) spoilers tease that Luna, the intern (Lisa Yamada), will reveal Eric Forrester's (John McCook) diagnosis to Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye). She Knows Soaps reports that Luna wants to help RJ Forrester (Joshua Hoffman) and take the burden of this heavy secret from his shoulders.
On Friday's episode, B&B revealed that Luna is Li Flannigan's (Naomi Matsuda) niece. Her mother warned her to stay away from the Forresters. She appeared to want to protect her daughter from heartbreak. She could be a long-lost Forrester somehow. However, we have yet to learn how.
Now, back to RJ. Lune worries that the pressure of keeping Eric's secret is too heavy for her new friend. She urges him to tell his father because Eric's health condition seems more severe than he initially said.
The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say that RJ knows he should tell his dad but worries about Eric feeling betrayed. He wants to wait until after the fashion show. All his granddad wants is one more line. He plans on giving that to him.
Luna decides to go behind RJ's back and tells Ridge about Eric's devastating diagnosis. She reveals that RJ knew about Eric's condition and hesitated to tell him about it.
Ridge will blow up at RJ about keeping something so important from him. RJ will feel betrayed by Luna, but his dad urges him to forgive his friend for doing the right thing.

Hypothesis:
Spoiler alert! In upcoming episodes of "The Bold and the Beautiful," Luna, an intern on the show, will reveal Eric Forrester's diagnosis to Ridge. She wants to help RJ Forrester and ease the burden of the secret off of him. **Luna knows that Eric has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease**, which is much more severe than previously stated. RJ does not want to tell Eric about his condition yet, as he does not want to make him feel betrayed. Luna goes behind RJ's back and tells Ridge about Eric's diagnosis, leading to tension between RJ and his friend.
