Premise:
Are you smarter than a really smart Singapore high school student? See if you can figure out Cheryl's birthday, the Singapore logic problem that's got the Internet twisted into knots. Some are even saying it's the math equivalent of the "What color is the dress" debate. The puzzling problem went viral after Singapore television host Kenneth Kong posted it to Facebook. Cheryl's birthday challenge was meant to test the better high-school students competing in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad, held April 8. Here it is: Cheryl has a birthday, and she doesn't want to share it right away. (Otherwise, we have no challenge to solve.) So she gives her friends Albert and Bernard a list of 10 possible birthday dates: May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15 or August 17. A brief conversation between Albert and Bernard -- who we assume are not lying for the sake of this problem -- gives the reader enough clues to eliminate nine of the 10 dates and discover Cheryl's birthday. That's assuming you want to celebrate with Cheryl after she's put you through all that trouble. See our video below for the answer from Georgia Tech Mathematician Matt Baker.  The New York Times and the Washington Post have also posted solutions to the problem, along with explanations. Of course, the Internet has offered other solutions.


Hypothesis:
**Cheryl, a Singapore high school student, has created a math problem that has gone viral on the internet.** The problem involves finding her birthday by given a list of 10 possible dates. After eliminating nine of the dates through a conversation between two friends, the remaining date reveals Cheryl's birthday.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true.

1. The hypothesis states that Cheryl, a Singapore high school student, has created a math problem that has gone viral on the internet. However, the premise does not mention that Cheryl created the problem herself. Instead, it states that the problem was meant to test the better high-school students competing in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad.
2. The hypothesis also mentions that the problem involves finding Cheryl's birthday by given a list of 10 possible dates. However, the premise does not explicitly state that the problem is about finding Cheryl's birthday. Instead, it states that Cheryl doesn't want to share her birthday right away and gives her friends a list of 10 possible birthday dates. The problem is about eliminating dates based on a conversation between two friends to discover Cheryl's birthday.
3. The hypothesis mentions that the remaining date reveals Cheryl's birthday. However, the premise does not explicitly state that the remaining date is Cheryl's birthday. Instead, it states that the reader can discover Cheryl's birthday by eliminating nine of the 10 dates through a conversation between Albert and Bernard.
4. The hypothesis mentions that the problem has gone viral on the internet. However, the premise states that the problem went viral after Singapore television host Kenneth Kong posted it to Facebook. The hypothesis incorrectly attributes the virality of the problem to Cheryl.
5. The hypothesis mentions that the problem is about finding Cheryl's birthday. However, the premise states that the problem is about eliminating dates based on a conversation between Albert and Bernard to discover Cheryl's birthday. The hypothesis oversimplifies the problem by focusing only on finding Cheryl's birthday, ignoring the elimination process involved.

In conclusion, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it incorrectly attributes the creation of the problem to Cheryl, oversimplifies the problem by focusing only on finding Cheryl's birthday, and incorrectly states that the remaining date is Cheryl's birthday. The premise provides more context and details about the problem, including the fact that it was meant to test high school students and the elimination process involved.
