Premise:
From the giant sequoias of Yosemite to the geysers of Yellowstone, the United States' national parks were made for you and me. And for Saturday and Sunday, they're also free. Though most of the National Park Service's 407 sites are free year-round, the 128 parks that charge a fee -- like Yellowstone and Yosemite -- will be free those two days. It's all part of National Park Week, happening April 18 through April 26, and it's hosted by the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation. Check out night-time astronomy parties, daytime Revolutionary War programs, Earth Day parties and family-friendly Junior Ranger activities at national park sites across the country. Not sure how to start? Go to FindYourPark.com to learn more about park sites near you. Go to www.nationalparkweek.org for more ideas on how to explore. Then the park service wants people to share their stories using the hashtag #FindYourPark and at FindYourPark.com.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true.

1. The hypothesis states that the National Park Service offers free admission to 128 parks, including Yellowstone and Yosemite, on April 18-19 and 25-26.
2. However, the premise states that the free admission is on April 18 and 19, not April 18-19 and 25-26.
3. The inconsistency is that the hypothesis incorrectly combines two different dates for free admission, which is not supported by the premise.
4. The premise clearly states that the free admission is on April 18 and 19, and it is part of National Park Week, which is happening from April 18 through April 26.
5. The hypothesis's error is that it combines two different dates for free admission, which is not supported by the premise.
6. The hypothesis's error is a significant one, as it misrepresents the information provided in the premise and could lead to confusion or incorrect planning for those who might want to take advantage of the free admission offer.
7. In conclusion, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it incorrectly combines two different dates for free admission and does not accurately reflect the information provided in the premise.
