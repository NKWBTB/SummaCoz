Premise:
Gastrointestinal illness has gripped 100 people on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control. Of the ship's 2,117 passengers, 95 have suffered from vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms, the CDC said. The illness has also affected five members of the 964-person crew. The CDC has yet to determine what's causing the ailments. Two staffers from the agency are scheduled to meet the West Coast-based ship in San Diego on Monday. The Infinity left San Diego on March 29. It made its last stop in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on April 10, according to MarineTraffic.com. Celebrity Cruises has been taking action since the outbreak began, including increasing cleaning and disinfection procedures, keeping passengers informed and taking specimens from the afflicted for testing by the CDC, the agency says. According to the Maritime Executive, this is the third time the Celebrity Infinity has suffered an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness, with others occurring in 2006 and 2013. The ship was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011.


Hypothesis:
Gastrointestinal illness has affected 100 people on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity, according to the CDC. Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. The cause is unknown and two CDC staffers will meet the ship in San Diego on Monday. This is the third outbreak on the ship, which **has a history of sanitation issues**.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true.

1. The hypothesis states that the cause of the gastrointestinal illness is unknown, but the premise states that the CDC has yet to determine what's causing the ailments. This is a subtle difference, but the hypothesis implies that the cause is definitely unknown, while the premise is more ambiguous.
2. The hypothesis mentions that this is the third outbreak on the ship, which has a history of sanitation issues. However, the premise does not mention anything about the ship having a history of sanitation issues. The premise only mentions that the Celebrity Infinity has suffered two previous outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness, in 2006 and 2013.
3. The hypothesis mentions that the cause is unknown and two CDC staffers will meet the ship in San Diego on Monday. However, the premise states that two staffers from the agency are scheduled to meet the West Coast-based ship in San Diego on Monday. The hypothesis implies that the CDC staffers are going to investigate the cause of the illness, but the premise does not necessarily imply that. The premise could be interpreted as the CDC staffers going to the ship to provide assistance and support, rather than to investigate the cause of the illness.
4. The hypothesis mentions that the cause is unknown and this is the third outbreak on the ship. However, the premise does not necessarily imply that the cause is unknown. The premise states that the CDC has yet to determine what's causing the ailments, which could mean that the cause is known but not yet identified, or that the cause is still under investigation. The hypothesis's assertion that the cause is unknown is not supported by the premise.
5. The hypothesis mentions that the cause is unknown and this is the third outbreak on the ship. However, the premise does not mention anything about the ship having a history of sanitation issues. The premise only mentions that the Celebrity Infinity has suffered two previous outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness, in 2006 and 2013. The hypothesis's assertion that the ship has a history of sanitation issues is not supported by the premise.

In conclusion, the hypothesis is not consistent with the premise because it makes several assumptions that are not supported by the prem
