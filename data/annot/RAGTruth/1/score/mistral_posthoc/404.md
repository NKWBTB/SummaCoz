Premise:
It's been a busy few weeks for multiples. The first set of female quintuplets in the world since 1969 was born in Houston on April 8, and the parents are blogging about their unique experience. Danielle Busby delivered all five girls at the Woman's Hospital of Texas via C-section at 28 weeks and two days, according to CNN affiliate KPRC. Parents Danielle and Adam and big sister Blayke are now a family of eight. The babies are named Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige. "We are so thankful and blessed," said Danielle Busby, who had intrauterine insemination to get pregnant. "I honestly give all the credit to my God. I am so thankful for this wonderful hospital and team of people here. They truly all are amazing." You can learn all about their journey at their blog, "It's a Buzz World." Early news reports said the Busby girls were the first all-female quintuplets born in the U.S. But a user alerted CNN to news clippings that show quintuplet girls were born in 1959 to Charles and Cecilia Hannan in San Antonio. All of the girls died within 24 hours. Like the Busby family, Sharon and Korey Rademacher were hoping for a second child. When they found out what they were having, they decided to keep it a secret from family and friends. That's why they didn't tell their family the gender of baby No. 2 -- or that Sharon was actually expecting not one but two girls, according to CNN affiliate WEAR. And when everyone arrived at West Florida Hospital in Pensacola, Florida, after Sharon gave birth March 11, they recorded everyone's reactions to meeting twins Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday and has been viewed more than 700,000 times. Could you keep it a secret?


Hypothesis:
Multiples: First Set of Female Quintuplets Born in Almost 50 Years **Delivers Four Girls**. **Danielle Busby delivers her fifth daughter** at Woman's Hospital of Texas via C-section. **This is the first set of female quintuplets born in Houston since 1969**. **Danielle and husband Adam have four other children** and are now a family of eight. The babies are named Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige. Parents share their journey on their blog, "It's a Buzz World". In 1959, Charles and Cecilia Hannan delivered the first set of quintuplet girls in the U.S., which ended in tragedy as all of them died within 24 hours. Sharon and Korey Rademacher also welcomed two girls into the world, keeping the pregnancy a secret from family and friends. Video of the surprise reaction to the newborn twins goes viral on YouTube with over 700,000 views.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true.

1. The hypothesis states that Danielle Busby delivered her fifth daughter at Woman's Hospital of Texas via C-section, but the premise states that she delivered all five girls at the Woman's Hospital of Texas via C-section.
2. The hypothesis mentions that this is the first set of female quintuplets born in Houston since 1969, but the premise does not specify that the birth only occurred in Houston.
3. The hypothesis mentions that Danielle and her husband Adam have four other children and are now a family of eight, but the premise does not provide the number of other children they have.
4. The hypothesis mentions that Sharon and Korey Rademacher also welcomed two girls into the world, but the premise does not mention their names or the number of children they have.
5. The hypothesis mentions that the video of the surprise reaction to the newborn twins goes viral on YouTube with over 700,000 views, but the premise does not provide the number of views the video has received.
6. The hypothesis does not mention the tragic outcome of the birth of the quintuplet girls in 1959, which is an important detail from the premise.
7. The hypothesis does not mention that Sharon and Korey Rademacher kept the pregnancy a secret from family and friends, which is an interesting detail from the premise.

In conclusion, the hypothesis contains several inaccuracies and omissions that are not supported by the premise. The hypothesis incorrectly states that Danielle Busby delivered one daughter, not five, and it does not mention the number of other children she has. It also incorrectly states that the birth only occurred in Houston, and it omits important details about the tragic outcome of the 1959 birth and the secret pregnancy of Sharon and Korey Rademacher. The hypothesis also incorrectly states that the video of the newborn twins has gone viral on YouTube with over 700,000 views, but the premise does not provide the number of views the video has received. Overall, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise in several significant ways.
