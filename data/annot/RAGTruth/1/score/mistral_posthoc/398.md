Premise:
Canadian fighter jets have carried out their first airstrike against ISIS in Syria, hitting one of the Sunni militant group's garrisons. The CF-18 Hornets bombed near ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa, Canada's Department of National Defence said Wednesday. It described the strike as successful. Canadian forces are part of the U.S.-led coalition trying to stem the extremist group's bloody advances in Iraq and Syria. Canadian warplanes have conducted dozens of strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq since November. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced plans last month to expand the airstrikes into Syria. "This first airstrike under the expanded mandate demonstrates our government's firm resolve to tackle the threat of terrorism against Canada and to promote international security and stability,"  Defense Minister Jason Kenney said in a statement. "ISIL is a genocidal terrorist organization and we will deny them safe haven in the region," he said, using an alternative acronym for the militant group, which refers to itself as the Islamic State. The Canadian aircraft and their crews safely returned to base, the military said. It wasn't immediately clear how many casualties the airstrike had caused. U.S. warplanes have been bombing ISIS positions in Iraq since August and in Syria since September. Other Western and Middle East nations are taking part in the campaign, either through direct military actions or by providing support. ISIS, whose influence has spread far beyond the borders of Iraq and Syria, has imposed its harsh interpretation on Islam on the areas it has seized, killing thousands of people and persecuting minorities. CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report.


Hypothesis:
Canadian fighter jets bombed an ISIS garrison in Syria in the group's de facto capital of Raqqa in a successful airstrike that **killed thousands of people**. The CF-18 Hornets bombed under the expanded mandate and were part of a US-led coalition trying to stop ISIS' advance. The Canadian military stated that they will continue to deny ISIL safe haven in the region.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true.

1. The hypothesis states that the airstrike killed thousands of people, but the premise does not mention any specific number of casualties.
2. The hypothesis mentions that the CF-18 Hornets bombed under the expanded mandate, but the premise only mentions that the Canadian forces have expanded their airstrikes into Syria.
3. The hypothesis mentions that the Canadian military will continue to deny ISIL safe haven in the region, but the premise only quotes Defense Minister Jason Kenney saying this.
4. The hypothesis does not mention that the airstrike was successful, but the premise states that the strike was successful.
5. The hypothesis does not mention that the Canadian forces are part of the US-led coalition, but the premise states that they are part of the coalition.
6. The hypothesis does not mention that the Canadian aircraft and their crews safely returned to base, but the premise states that they did.
7. The hypothesis does not mention that the US warplanes have been bombing ISIS positions in Iraq since August and in Syria since September, but the premise states that they have.
8. The hypothesis does not mention that ISIS has imposed its harsh interpretation on Islam on the areas it has seized, killing thousands of people and persecuting minorities, but the premise states that they have.

In conclusion, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it adds information that is not present in the premise, such as the number of casualties and the Canadian military's future plans, and it omits important details, such as the success of the airstrike and the fact that the Canadian forces are part of the US-led coalition. The hypothesis also misrepresents the number of casualties and the Canadian military's plans.
