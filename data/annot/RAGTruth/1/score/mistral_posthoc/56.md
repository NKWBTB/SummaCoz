Premise:
Getting caught napping on the job is never good.  Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. "There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around," he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. "All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear," Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. "At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint," Jamie Davis said.  "That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us." As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. "At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known," said Troi Ge.  "He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. "We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did," Collins said. "When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane." "I think it's scary and really unsafe, too," Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. "Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. "During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home," the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.


Hypothesis:
An Alaska Airlines Flight 448 made an emergency landing on Monday after a worker from a contractor handling loading the luggage fell asleep and **accidentally triggered an alarm in the cargo hold**. The worker was taken to a hospital as a precaution but passed a drug test and was later discharged. The flight was delayed for several hours and the passengers were spooked by the incident. Alaska Airlines is investigating the incident and has stated that all ramp employees have security badges and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true.

1. The hypothesis states that the worker fell asleep and accidentally triggered an alarm in the cargo hold, but the premise does not mention any alarm being triggered. Instead, the premise states that the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold.
2. The hypothesis states that the flight was delayed for several hours, but the premise does not mention the length of the delay. The premise only states that the plane was in the air for 14 minutes before making an emergency landing.
3. The hypothesis states that the passengers were spooked by the incident, but the premise does not mention the passengers being spooked. Instead, the premise mentions that the passengers knew something was wrong but does not describe them as being spooked.
4. The hypothesis states that the worker was taken to a hospital as a precaution but passed a drug test and was later discharged, but the premise does not mention the worker being taken to a hospital. The premise only states that the worker was taken to an area hospital as a precaution.
5. The hypothesis states that the worker was a contractor handling loading the luggage, but the premise does not mention the worker being a contractor. The premise only states that the worker was a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage.
6. The hypothesis states that the flight made an emergency landing, but the premise does not use the term "emergency landing." The premise only states that the plane made an unscheduled landing.
7. The hypothesis states that the man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight, but the premise does not mention the size of the team. The premise only states that the man was a ramp agent and was part of a team that handles loading the luggage.
8. The hypothesis states that all ramp employees have security badges and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, but the premise does not mention the security badges or the criminal background checks. The premise only states that all ramp employees have security badges and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired.

In conclusion, the hypothesis contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies with the premise. The hypothesis incorrectly states that the worker triggered an alarm, that the flight was delayed for several hours
