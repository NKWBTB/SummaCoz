Premise:
An American citizen was wounded by gunfire Thursday as she drove from the medical school in Karachi, Pakistan, where she works, police said. Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old California native, was shot in the right cheek and left arm and is unconscious but expected to survive, according to Mohamad Shah, a Karachi police spokesman. Police found pamphlets that the assailants had thrown into Lobo's car, written in Urdu, saying "America should be burnt," Shah said. Lobo had left the Jinnah Medical and Dental College, where she works as vice principal, to pick up her two daughters from school. Two assailants on a passing motorcycle shot her while she was driving, Shah said. "Our U.S. Consulate General in Karachi is in close contact with Pakistani authorities and is working to obtain more information," said a U.S. Embassy spokesperson. Lobo is being treated at the Karachi's Aga Khan Hospital, said Shah. She has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Christian Pakistani who is a librarian at the American School in Karachi. Karachi police are investigating, Shah said.


Hypothesis:
An American woman working at a medical school in Pakistan was shot by two assailants on a motorcycle while **driving home to pick up her daughters**. The attack occurred despite a recent surge in security measures. Police found anti-American pamphlets near the scene of the crime. The victim, Debra Lobo, is expected to survive after surgery.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true.

1. The hypothesis states that the attack occurred despite a recent surge in security measures, but the premise does not mention any recent surge in security measures.
2. The hypothesis mentions that the victim is expected to survive after surgery, but the premise states that the victim is unconscious but expected to survive, which is different from the hypothesis.
3. The hypothesis mentions that the victim is an American woman, but the premise states that the victim is a 55-year-old California native, which is not the same as a woman.
4. The hypothesis mentions that the victim is married to a Christian Pakistani who is a librarian at the American School in Karachi, but the premise does not mention the victim's marital status or the occupation of her husband.
5. The hypothesis mentions that the victim is an American woman working at a medical school in Pakistan, but the premise states that the victim is a vice principal at the Jinnah Medical and Dental College, which is not the same as a medical school.
6. The hypothesis mentions that the attackers threw anti-American pamphlets into the victim's car, but the premise states that the pamphlets were found near the scene of the crime, not in the victim's car.
7. The hypothesis mentions that the victim is being treated at the Karachi's Aga Khan Hospital, but the premise states that the victim is being treated at the Karachi's Aga Khan Hospital, which is consistent with the premise.
8. The hypothesis mentions that the victim is expected to survive after surgery, but the premise states that the victim is unconscious but expected to survive, which is different from the hypothesis.

Therefore, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it contains inaccuracies and misrepresentations of the facts presented in the premise. The hypothesis incorrectly states that there was a recent surge in security measures, that the victim is a woman, that the victim is married, that the victim is an American woman working at a medical school, that the attackers threw the pamphlets into the victim's car, and that the victim is expected to survive after surgery. The premise does not support these claims. Instead, it provides details about the victim's identity, the circumstances of the attack, and the investigation by the Kar
