Premise:
Over the last year more than 25,000 people, a population about the size of Key West, Florida, have fought Ebola infections. More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the "most severe public health emergency seen in modern times" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. "Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks," the latest WHO report said.

Hypothesis:
**Since August 2014**, more than 25,000 people have fought Ebola infections, with over 10,000 fatalities. **Over 15,000 survivors are experiencing ongoing physical and emotional trauma.** Although the intensity of the outbreak has decreased, dozens of new cases are reported each week. The mixed results from efforts to stop the spread of Ebola have led to concerns about the possibility of future outbreaks. The impact of Ebola has revealed flaws in healthcare systems globally.

No, the hypothesis is not true. 
- The hypothesis states that over 15,000 survivors are experiencing ongoing physical and emotional trauma. However, the premise does not mention anything about survivors experiencing ongoing physical and emotional trauma.
