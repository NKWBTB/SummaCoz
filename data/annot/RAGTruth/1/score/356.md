Premise:
Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. "My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color)," Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. "It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner." As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. "We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's," Mainzer wrote.


Hypothesis:
Malala Yousafzai received a new honor as an asteroid in our solar system has been named after her. The asteroid, 316201 Malala, discovered in June 2010, circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter and is about 4 kilometers in diameter. **Scientist Amy Mainzer, who worked with Malala on an educational science show**, decided to name the asteroid after her due to her significant contribution to education.

Generated_reasoning:
No, the hypothesis is not true. 
- The hypothesis states that "Scientist Amy Mainzer, who worked with Malala on an educational science show, decided to name the asteroid after her due to her significant contribution to education." This statement is inconsistent with the premise for several reasons: 1. The premise does not mention that Amy Mainzer worked with Malala on an educational science show. Instead, it states that Mainzer discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. 2. The premise does not mention that Mainzer worked with Malala on an educational science show. Instead, it states that Mainzer discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. 3. The premise does not mention that the asteroid is named after Malala due to her significant contribution to education. Instead, it states that Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48, which is a reference to the asteroid's color and size. 4. The premise does not mention that the asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter. Instead, it states that it circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years. 5. The premise does not mention that the asteroid is about 4 kilometers in diameter. Instead, it states that its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner. 6. The premise does not mention that the asteroid was discovered in June 2010. Instead, it states that Mainzer discovered it in June 2010. 7. The premise does not mention that the asteroid is named after Malala due to her significant contribution to education. Instead, it states that Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48, which is a reference to the asteroid's color and size. 8. The premise does not mention that Mainzer worked with Malala on an educational science show. Instead, it states that she discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. In conclusion, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise because it inaccurately describes the asteroid's name, the scientist's relationship with Malala, and the reason for the asteroid's naming.
