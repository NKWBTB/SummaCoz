    Article: 
    There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.  Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans. The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Doncaster Rovers drew 0-0 with Fleetwood Town, but the article states that the match was a goalless draw.
2. The summary mentions that Doncaster Rovers are rooted to the bottom of League One, but the article does not mention the team's position in the league.
3. The summary states that the media team made the match highlights short and sweet, lasting only 27 seconds, but the article states that the media team faced a tough challenge compiling the match highlights and that the video was only 27 seconds long with 14 seconds of match action.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed information about the match and the team's performance, while the summary is more concise but contains errors.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions that Doncaster Rovers are rooted to the bottom of League One, but the article mentions that the team is firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One.
2. The summary does that state that the match left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel but the article does.
