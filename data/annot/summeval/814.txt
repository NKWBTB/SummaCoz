    A young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese bossÂ Maurice Van Ryn has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life. For years she kept what Van Ryn did to her a secret, but when she found out he had been caught she knew she had to break her silence. The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child. One of his victims told Sydney's District Court on Monday that she is scared for her future relationships, and didn't understand why she had been targeted. Scroll down for video . A young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn (pictured) has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life . The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child . 'I am scared for my future relationships,' the young woman said, according to News Corp. 'He has stolen my right to share my body with someone for the first time.' Van Ryn sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong. 'I didn't understand why he would do something like this. Does this happen to every kid? Do friends do this to other friends?' she said. 'I didn't know it was against the law.' Van Ryn (left) sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong . She said she hadn't spoken up about the abuse until the day she heard he had been caught, and since then had attempted to take her own life. 'I knew I had to say something.' Since then, however, she says she has been scared people will find out. 'I didn't want people to know what happened to me. I don't want people asking questions. She says she wonders when Van Ryn, who is now in custody will be out in the community again, and she worries what he did to her will forever affect how she relates to men. She said she has suffered depression since she was 14 and had been hospitalised for self harm and attempted suicide. The hearing continues.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the young woman "found out he had been caught," implying that she discovered Van Ryn's crimes after they had already been committed. However, the article states that Van Ryn has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including persistent sexual abuse of a child, which suggests that he was caught and charged before the young woman spoke out.
2. The summary states that the young woman "broke her silence" when she found out Van Ryn had been caught. However, the article states that she spoke out in court on Monday, which suggests that she had been silent about the abuse for some time before then.
3. The summary states that the young woman is scared for her future relationships, but the article does not mention this. The only mention of the young woman's feelings is her statement that she did not understand why Van Ryn would do something like this to her, which is not the same as being scared for her future relationships.
4. The summary states that Van Ryn sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she spoke. However, the article states that Van Ryn did not look at the young woman as she spoke, but it does not mention his demeanor in the dock.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or misrepresents several key details. It is important to ensure that any summary or summary of an article accurately represents the information in the original article to avoid spreading misinformation.
