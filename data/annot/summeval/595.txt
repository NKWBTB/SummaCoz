'I love the club, I love the city and I love my team-mates. Everything is perfect for me here. 'There is absolutely no reason for me to leave. I want to sign a new contract. 'If the coach decides not to play me, that is his decision. But I am ready whenever I am called upon.'

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Gregory van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain in the summer.

However, the article states that Van der Wiel has not denied the claims and has instead reiterated his love for the club.

Step 2: The summary mentions that Van der Wiel had a falling out with his boss Laurent Blanc after being dropped for the Champions League clash against Chelsea.

The article confirms this information, but also adds that Van der Wiel is still happy at the club and wants to sign a new contract.

Step 3: The summary mentions that the Parisians are being linked with a move for Barcelona star Dani Alves.

The article does not mention this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article (the link with Dani Alves) and omits information that is present in the article (Van der Wiel's desire to sign a new contract and his happiness at the club).
