    Article: 
    Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has reminded Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe about their professional responsibilities and urged them to learn from a chastening week. Sterling, the England international who will lead Liverpool’s line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge, was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday. Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes. Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (left) hasn't disciplined Sterling (pictured) or Ibe for the incident . Ibe was present among the Reds squad during their training session on Friday ahead of their FA Cup semi . Rodgers, who has Steven Gerrard available for the FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa, spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday but neither will be disciplined and Rodgers now wants to draw a line under the matter. He said: ‘It is understanding that when you are a professional, elite sportsperson, there are things you can and cannot be doing and be seen to be doing. ‘It’s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities. ‘It is difficult. Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things — and I’m not talking about this instance — (but) how it gets framed is totally different.’ Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension . ‘When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,’ said Rodgers. ‘Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. ‘Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals. It’s all part of the journey — losing but taking that forward and improving you.’ Rodgers (left) hasn't revealed whether he'll recall Gerrard for Sunday's clash against Aston Villa at Wembley . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Brendan Rodgers wants to draw a line under the matter of Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe's off-field activities, but the article states that Rodgers spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday about their responsibilities as professional athletes. This suggests that Rodgers has not drawn a line under the matter, but rather addressed it with the players.
2. The summary mentions that Daniel Sturridge was exposed to inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that Sterling and Ibe were pictured with shisha pipes, and that Rodgers has not disciplined them for the incident.
3. The summary states that Steven Gerrard will be available for the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that Gerrard is available after serving a three-match suspension, but does not specify whether he will be recalled for the match.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary only mentions that Daniel Sturridge was exposed to inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday, but the article not only mentions this but also mentions that Sterling and Ibe were pictured with shisha pipes.
2. The summary does not mentiont that Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers hasn't disciplined Sterling or Ibe for the incident but the article does.
3. The summary does not states that Steven Gerrard will be available for the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa.
