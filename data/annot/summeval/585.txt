(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for "Barbara," left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the "warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions." Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited "three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales," which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. "For her to go to Mexico," Mate said, "It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from." Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to "navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive," he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. "Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look," Mate said. Fourth baby orca born this season .

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the whale swam from Oregon State University, which is not accurate. The article states that the whale, named Varvara, swam from her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico.
2. The summary mentions that Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness World Records website, but the article does not mention any record or mention of Guinness World Records.
3. The summary states that the whale is Russian for "Barbara," which is not accurate. The article states that Varvara is Russian for "Barbara," but it is a name given to the whale by scientists, not a fact about the whale's origin.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that Varvara visited three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales, which is a significant finding mentioned in the article.
5. The summary does not mention the implications of Varvara's journey on our understanding of gray whale populations, which is a key point made in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits key information from the article.
