    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Manchester United will have to pay £46million to make Falcao's transfer permanent. However, the article states that United are unlikely to take up that option since Falcao has only scored four goals all season.

Inconsistency: The summary states that United will have to pay £46million to make Falcao's transfer permanent, but the article states that they are unlikely to do so because of Falcao's poor performance.

2. The summary states that Falcao has struggled for Manchester United during his season-long loan. However, the article states that Falcao has struggled to reach the heights he achieved before suffering a serious knee injury.

Inconsistency: The summary states that Falcao has struggled for Manchester United, but the article states that he has struggled to reach his previous heights due to his knee injury.

3. The summary states that Falcao is not happy in France but thinks he would have been better off staying at Monaco. However, the article does not mention anything about Falcao's happiness or his desire to stay at Monaco.

Inconsistency: The summary states that Falcao is not happy in France, but the article does not provide any information about his happiness or his desire to stay at Monaco.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that Falcao has struggled for Manchester United, but the article states that he has struggled to reach his previous heights due to his knee injury. Additionally, the summary states that Falcao is not happy in France, but the article does not provide any information about his happiness or his desire to stay at Monaco.
