    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Check the summary's statement about Joe Hart's age.
The summary states that Joe Hart is 37 years old, but the article states that he is 10 years younger than Buffon, which means he is 27 years old.

Step 2: Check the summary's statement about Joe Hart's caps.
The summary states that Joe Hart has won his 50th cap, but the article states that he has won his 50th cap at his age of 27, not 37.

Step 3: Check the summary's statement about Gianluigi Buffon's caps.
The summary states that Buffon has won his 147th cap, but the article states that he has won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, which is not the same as the summary's statement.

Step 4: Check the summary's statement about Joe Hart's comment on Buffon.
The summary states that Joe Hart labelled Buffon a "legend of the game" and said that he is "50" at 37 years old, but the article states that Hart said Buffon was an inspiration and that he wants to learn from him, not that he called him a legend of the game.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about Joe Hart's age, caps, and Buffon's caps, and it also misquotes Hart's comment on Buffon.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that hart has said buffon is ` 50 ' at 37 years old which is not mentioned in the article.
2. The article states that Buffon has won his 147th cap, but the summary does not mention that Buffon has won his 147th cap.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that "hart has said buffon is ` 50 ' at 37 years old", the sentence does not make any sense.
