    Filipe Luis insists he wants to stay at Chelsea until the end of his contract, despite Atletico Madrid considering bringing him back in the summer. The full back signed a three-year contract when he moved from the Spanish champions last July, but has struggled to make the left back position his own at Stamford Bridge. Atletico hope that may give them leverage, but Luis said: ‘I’m happy at Chelsea. I want to stay at the club until the end of my contract.’ Filipe Luis insists he wants to stay at Chelsea (right), despite Atletico Madrid considering re-signing him . Luis played in Brazil’s friendly wins against France and Chile during the international break, but attentions now turn to the Premier League title run-in. And Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is refusing to let his league leaders rest on their laurels until the job is done. ‘He always asks for everybody to be focused and concentrate in the matches and try to win every game we play,’ Luis added. ‘He always says that to us. He never says anything else. ‘It’s really difficult. We have nine really difficult games. We have to be better than ever but I think we’re prepared to cope with the hard situation that we have.’ The defender's attentions now turn to the Premier League having played for Brazil against France and Chile . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Filipe Luis wants to stay at Chelsea until the end of his contract, but the article states that Atletico Madrid is considering bringing him back in the summer. This is a contradictory statement, as the article suggests that Luis may not be staying at Chelsea for the full duration of his contract.
2. The summary mentions that Luis played in Brazil's friendly wins against France and Chile, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that Luis played in Brazil's friendly matches during the international break, without specifying the opponents.
3. The summary quotes Luis as saying that he wants to stay at Chelsea until the end of his contract, but the article does not include this quote. Instead, the article quotes Luis as saying that he is happy at Chelsea and that he wants to stay at the club, but it does not provide the same level of detail as the summary.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article, such as Luis's desire to stay at Chelsea until the end of his contract, and it omits information that is included in the article, such as Atletico Madrid's interest in bringing Luis back to the club.
