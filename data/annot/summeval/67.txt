    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the dress was worn by Vivien Leigh when she played Scarlett O'Hara, but the article states that the dress was worn by Vivien Leigh in several key scenes, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler and when she gets attacked in the shanty town.
2. The summary states that the dress was sold for $137,000 at auction, but the article states that the dress, along with other items, were part of a private collection and were sold for a total of $244,500.
3. The summary states that the dress was slate blue-gray when it was worn in the movie, but the article states that the dress has faded to light gray over time.
4. The summary does not mention that the dress was one of more than 150 items that were part of a private collection, or that it was one of over 300,000 pieces of memorabilia collected by James Tumblin.
5. The summary does not mention that Hattie McDaniel, who played Scarlett's devoted nanny Mammy, was the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or misstates several key details, such as the fact that the dress was part of a private collection, that it has faded over time, and that Hattie McDaniel was the first African-American actor to win an Academy Award.
