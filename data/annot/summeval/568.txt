He may have married his red-headed kitchen maid out of duty, but as he tells her that she makes him a better man, audiences can have little doubt about his feelings. What is rather less convincing, however, is the timeline of the pregnancy. With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant. Just minutes after – once again without any nod to the passing of time – she is giving birth, with the last month of her pregnancy passing in less than the blink of an eye.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Timeline of pregnancy: The summary states that Demelza is eight months pregnant, but the article states that she was barely showing last week and the pregnancy advanced rapidly to the point of giving birth within minutes.
2. Lack of time passage: The summary jumps from the announcement of the pregnancy to the birth without any mention of the passing of time, while the article highlights the rapid progression of the pregnancy.
3. Pregnancy timeline inconsistency: The article states that Elizabeth was pregnant and gave birth within two episodes, which is not consistent with the timeline of Demelza's pregnancy in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it oversimplifies the timeline of Demelza's pregnancy and birth, and does not accurately reflect the rapid progression of the pregnancy as described in the article.
