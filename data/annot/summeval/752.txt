    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Gemma is at risk of being banned from seeing her own children because she refuses to stop drinking and partying. However, the article states that Gemma's mother, Debbie, is threatening to ban her from seeing the children because of her constant drinking and partying, and because she suspects Gemma of stealing.
2. The summary implies that Gemma is the primary caregiver for her children, but the article states that Debbie has been looking after the children all their lives and that Gemma handed them over to her when they were four months old.
3. The summary mentions that Gemma's children call her "mum" and not "grandma," but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that Gemma's mother, Debbie, is upset because Gemma prefers drinking and parties to work and motherhood, but the article states that Debbie is upset because she believes Gemma is not a fit mother and is not putting her children first.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or misrepresents key details and presents a different perspective on the situation.
