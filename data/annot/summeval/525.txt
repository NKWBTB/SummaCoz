     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the video is entitled "Harry Kane - PFA Player of the Year?", but the article does not mention any video with that title. The article only mentions a video produced by Copa90 that features Harry Kane's goals and celebrations from the season.
2. The summary states that the video uses still photographs of Harry Kane placed one on top of the other to produce an animated effect, but the article does not mention anything about the video being animated. The article only mentions that the video features still photographs of Kane's goals and celebrations.
3. The summary states that the video features Kane's long-range strike against Chelsea, his headed goal against Arsenal, and his debut goal for England, but the article does not mention a long-range strike against Chelsea or a headed goal against Arsenal. The article only mentions Kane's 20th Premier League goal of the season against Newcastle and his debut goal for England.
4. The summary states that the video is about Harry Kane being nominated for the PFA Player and Young Player of the Year awards, but the article only mentions that Kane is nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations that do not match the information in the article.
