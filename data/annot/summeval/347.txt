    Article: 
    (CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. "The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from," Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.

     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Date of the fires: The summary states that the fires were started on April 14, but the article does not mention any specific date for the start of the fires. Instead, it states that the fires were ongoing and had been burning for some time.
2. Destruction of villages: The summary mentions that the fires have destroyed dozens of villages, but the article does not mention any destruction of villages. Instead, it states that the fires have spread throughout the region and have caused air quality issues.
3. Cause of the fires: The summary states that the fires were started by farmers burning grass in their fields, but the article does not mention any specific cause for the fires. Instead, it states that the fires were believed to have been caused by strong winds and spread throughout the region.
4. Smoke carrying: The summary states that the smoke from Siberia was carried to the Pacific Northwest by atmospheric winds, but the article does not mention any specific winds carrying the smoke. Instead, it states that the smoke was picked up by winds and carried to other regions.
5. Color of the sunset: The summary states that the sunset was red due to smoke particles filtering out shorter wavelength colors, but the article does not mention any specific color of the sunset. Instead, it states that the sunsets were stunning and had a deep reddish color due to the smoke.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes specific details that are not present in the article, and omits other important details that are present in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The article states that the fires were started by farmers burning grass in their fields, but the summary does not mention any specific cause for the fires. 
2. The article states that the sunset was red due to smoke particles filtering out shorter wavelength colors, but the summary does not mention any specific color of the sunset.
