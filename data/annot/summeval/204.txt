     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Paul Downton is the England managing director, but the article states that he was dismissed from the position.

2. The summary mentions that Kevin Pietersen is set to return to the England set-up, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it focuses on Pietersen's return to Surrey and his potential return to the international set-up.

3. The summary states that Pietersen was axed by the former managing director in 2014, but the article states that he was controversially axed.

4. The summary mentions that Pietersen is looking to force his way back into the Test set-up, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it focuses on his return to Surrey and his attempt to regain his place in the international set-up.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, it states that Pietersen is set to return to the England set-up, when the article only mentions his return to Surrey. Additionally, the summary portrays Pietersen as being in a jovial mood, when the article states that he was in deep thought.
