    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Joe Hart labeled Gianluigi Buffon a "legend of the game" after the 1-1 draw with Italy on Tuesday night. However, the article states that Hart made these comments after the match against Italy on Tuesday night, but before the 1-1 draw.
2. The summary states that Buffon won his 147th cap against England, but the article states that Buffon won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night.
3. The summary states that Hart said Buffon was a "legend of the game" and that he is still learning from him, but the article does not mention Hart using the phrase "legend of the game."
4. The summary states that Hart is desperate to add to his 50 international caps, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, Hart did not label Buffon a "legend of the game" in the article, and the summary incorrectly states that Buffon won his 147th cap against England. Additionally, the summary includes a statement from Hart that is not present in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary gianluigi buffon has labelled buffon which is not mentioned in the article.
