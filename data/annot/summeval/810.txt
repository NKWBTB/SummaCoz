One of his victims told Sydney's District Court on Monday that she is scared for her future relationships, and didn't understand why she had been targeted. Scroll down for video . A young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn (pictured) has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life . The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child . 'I am scared for my future relationships,' the young woman said, according to News Corp. 'He has stolen my right to share my body with someone for the first time.' Van Ryn sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong. 'I didn't understand why he would do something like this. Does this happen to every kid? Do friends do this to other friends?' she said. 'I didn't know it was against the law.' Van Ryn (left) sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her.

She said she hadn't spoken up about the abuse until the day she heard he had been caught, and since then had attempted to take her own life. 'I knew I had to say something.' Since then, however, she says she has been scared people will find out. 'I didn't want people to know what happened to me. I don't want people asking questions. She says she wonders when Van Ryn, who is now in custody will be out in the community again, and she worries what he did to her will forever affect how she relates to men. She said she has suffered depression since she was 14 and had been hospitalised for self harm and attempted suicide. The hearing continues.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Timeline: The summary states that the young woman "kept what Van Ryn did to her a secret for years," but the article states that she only found out about Van Ryn's abuse when she heard he had been caught. This suggests that the young woman did not keep the secret for years, but rather only found out about the abuse recently.
2. Guilt: The summary states that Van Ryn "pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences," but the article does not mention any specific pleas or guilty verdicts. The article only states that Van Ryn has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, but does not provide any details about the nature of the pleas or the specific charges.
3. Impact: The summary states that the young woman "has suffered depression since she was 14 and had been hospitalized for self-harm and attempted suicide," but the article does not mention any specific details about the young woman's depression or hospitalization. The article only states that the young woman has been scared for her future relationships and has attempted to take her own life.
4. Language: The summary uses the present tense to describe the young woman's experiences ("she kept what Van Ryn did to her a secret"), while the article uses the past tense to describe the same events ("she found out he had been caught"). This inconsistency in verb tense suggests that the summary may not be entirely consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article, as it contains inconsistencies in timeline, guilt, impact, and language. Therefore, the summary may not accurately reflect the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary does not mention the young woman's struggles with depression, self-harm, and attempted suicide, which are prominent in the article. This omission suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's content.
2. While the summary does mention the wealthy nsw businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, the summary does not mention the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child which is mentioned in the article.
3. The summary does not mention the reasoning behind she hadn't spoken up about the abuse until the day she heard he had been caught.
