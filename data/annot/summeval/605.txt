Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Carlos Tevez's deal with Juventus does not expire until the end of next season, but he has reportedly told the club he wishes to leave this summer. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Tevez's contract with Juventus runs until 2016 and that he has not yet terminated his contract.
2. The summary also states that Boca Juniors have confirmed they are close to completing a deal for Tevez, but the article does not mention any confirmation from Boca Juniors. In fact, the article states that Boca Juniors president Daniel Angelici has stressed that Tevez must terminate his contract with Juventus first.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that Juventus are reluctant to lose Tevez, who is the league's top scorer, or that they have already started identifying potential replacements. This information is present in the article, but not in the summary.
