1. The summary states that Patrick Kluivert has had a winning start in World Cup qualifiers, but the article does not mention anything about winning starts.
2. The summary states that the Caribbean island team advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF, but the article does not mention the Caribbean island team or advancing to the second qualifying round.
3. The summary states that Patrick Kluivert's team won 4-3 on aggregate at Montserrat, but the article does not mention anything about a 4-3 aggregate win or a match at Montserrat.
4. The summary states that the Holland face 2-2 in a second-leg match at Montserrat, but the article does not mention anything about the Holland or a second-leg match at Montserrat.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and misleading information. The article actually describes Patrick Kluivert's success as the coach of Curacao in World Cup qualifiers, but the summary does not accurately reflect this information.
