    Serge Gnabry says he is feeling 'better and better' all the time as the Arsenal teenager prepares to return after more than a year out. The 19-year-old midfielder impressed for the Gunners last season, but his progress has been stunted by a serious knee injury.

Serge Gnabry played 90 minutes for Arsenal Under 21s against Reading on Monday . The 19-year-old has not featured for the first team since March last year after suffering serious knee injury . Gnabry impressed for the Gunners last season before his progress was curtailed due to injury . The Germany Under-21 international played for Arsenal's development squad as they lost 1-0 to Reading on Monday and is now over his injury worries. 'I am feeling good, I'm feeling better and better,' Gnabry told Arsenal Media. 'It is my second 90 minutes [in the space of a week], I am playing and over my injury so it is all good and I am looking forward to the next game.' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Serge Gnabry has not featured for Arsenal since March last year, but the article states that he played 90 minutes for Arsenal's development squad against Reading on Monday.
2. The summary mentions that Gnabry has not played since the Champions League last season, but the article states that he played for Arsenal's development squad on Monday.
3. The summary states that Gnabry is still sidelined with a serious knee injury, but the article states that he has overcome his injury worries and played 90 minutes in two consecutive games for Arsenal's development squad.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it does not accurately reflect Gnabry's current situation and his progress towards recovery from his knee injury.
