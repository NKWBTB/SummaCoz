    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistency
The summary states that Manchester City players will lose £500,000-a-man in bonuses if they fail to qualify for the Champions League, while the article states that the players have incentivized contracts to stay within financial fairplay requirements.

Step 2: Analyze the article
The article explains that Manchester City players have incentivized contracts to ensure the club stays within financial fairplay requirements. This means that the players will receive bonuses based on the club's performance, but the article does not mention anything about losing £500,000-a-man if they fail to qualify for the Champions League.

Step 3: Analyze the summary
The summary states that Manchester City players will lose £500,000-a-man in bonuses if they fail to qualify for the Champions League. This is not supported by the article, which states that the players have incentivized contracts but does not mention anything about losing bonuses if they fail to qualify for the Champions League.

Step 4: Conclude
Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that Manchester City players will lose £500,000-a-man in bonuses if they fail to qualify for the Champions League, while the article states that the players have incentivized contracts to ensure the club stays within financial fairplay requirements.
