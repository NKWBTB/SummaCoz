     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion, but the article does not mention any injury-time winner. Instead, the article states that Vardy scored a winner in the 3-2 win over West Brom, but it does not specify whether it was an injury-time goal.
2. The summary mentions that Swansea host Swansea on Saturday, but the article does not mention Swansea at all. The article only refers to Leicester's match against Swansea.
3. The summary states that Leicester are bottom of the table, but the article does not mention their position in the table. Instead, the article states that Leicester are in the relegation zone, but it does not specify their position.
4. The summary mentions that Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs, but the article does not mention this. The article only quotes Pearson as saying that Leicester need to make sure their own run-in is what they want it to be.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations that are not supported by the article.
