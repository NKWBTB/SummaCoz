    Article: 
    Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Age of the victim: The summary states that the victim was 15 years old, while the article states that the victim was 9 years old when the abuse began.
2. Time period of abuse: The summary states that the abuse occurred over a four-year period, while the article states that the abuse occurred over a three- or four-year time period.
3. Number of victims: The summary states that Rebbie filmed "several victims," while the article states that investigators found 41 videos that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom.
4. Purpose of the hidden camera: The summary states that Rebbie purchased the hidden camera specifically to record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, while the article states that Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides different details about the age of the victim, the time period of abuse, the number of victims, and the purpose of the hidden camera.

###Corrected:
1. Time period of abuse: The summary states that the abuse occurred over a four-year period, while the article states that the abuse occurred over a three- or four-year time period.
2. The summary states that she faces several charges but the article does not make any mention of Kevin Rebbie's gender.
