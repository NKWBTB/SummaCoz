He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the toddler was not attacked by the animals, but the article states that the zoo's executive director, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, said the cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit. This is inconsistent with the summary's statement that the boy was not attacked by the animals.
2. The summary states that the toddler was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor injuries, but the article states that the boy suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital. This is inconsistent with the summary's statement that the toddler suffered from minor injuries.
3. The summary states that the boy slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit, but the article states that the toddler's mother was holding him and another child when he slipped and fell between 10 to 12ft and into the pit. This is inconsistent with the summary's statement that the boy slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit.
4. The summary states that the zoo plans to press child endangering charges against the child's mother, but this is not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed information about the incident, including the fact that the toddler's mother was holding him and another child when he fell, and that the cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit. The article also mentions that the zoo plans to press child endangering charges against the child's mother, which is not mentioned in the summary.
