    A two-year-old boy is recovering after falling into a cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo after his parents dangled him over the edge, officials said.

A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the toddler was "airlifted to hospital," but the article states that he was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene.
2. The summary states that the toddler suffered from "minor injuries," but the article states that he suffered from "minor bumps and bruises."
3. The summary states that the boy's leg was injured in the fall, but the article does not mention any injuries to the boy's leg.
4. The summary states that the cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, but the article states that the zoo officials believe the strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing, which could have put the child in danger of being attacked by the cheetahs.
5. The summary does not mention that the zoo plans to press child endangering charges against the child's mother, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that are significant enough to change the meaning of the story.
