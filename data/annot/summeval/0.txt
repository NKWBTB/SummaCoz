'It's just a matter of opinion, and my opinion was that he got pulled off after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson, so he shouldn't have been in the squad.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Timing of Paul Merson's comments: The summary states that Paul Merson had another dig at Andros Townsend after his appearance for Tottenham against Burnley, implying that Merson made the comment after the game. However, the article states that Merson made the comment on Twitter after Townsend scored for England against Italy, which happened several days after the Burnley game.
2. Reason for Merson's criticism: The summary suggests that Merson criticized Townsend because he was brought on with only seven minutes remaining in the game, implying that Merson thought Townsend was not given enough time to make an impact. However, the article reveals that Merson has a history of criticizing Townsend and questioned his call-up to the England squad last week, which is a different reason for his criticism.
3. Townsend's performance: The summary states that Andros Townsend scored the equalizer for Tottenham in the 89th minute, but the article states that he scored the equalizer for England against Italy in a friendly match, not for Tottenham.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the timing and reason for Paul Merson's criticism of Andros Townsend, and also mixes up Townsend's performance in different games.
