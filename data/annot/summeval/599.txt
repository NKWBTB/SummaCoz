    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Gregory van der Wiel is happy at PSG and has no plans to leave, but the article states that he had a recent spat with the manager Laurent Blanc after being dropped from the team. This suggests that van der Wiel may not be as happy at PSG as the summary claims.

Step 2: The summary mentions a £250million release clause in van der Wiel's contract, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that van der Wiel has a year left on his current contract.

Step 3: The summary states that van der Wiel has been linked with a move to the Nou Camp, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that PSG is being linked with a move for Barcelona star Dani Alves, which could potentially affect van der Wiel's future with the club.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it presents a more positive view of van der Wiel's situation at PSG than the article does. The article suggests that van der Wiel may not be as happy at PSG as the summary claims, and that his future with the club could be affected by the club's interest in signing Dani Alves.
