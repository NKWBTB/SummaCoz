    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Anders Lindegaard made the most of the English weather with his Swedish model wife Misse Beqiri, but the article does not mention anything about the couple spending time together in England. In fact, the article specifically states that Lindegaard and Beqiri married in a romantic beach wedding in Mauritius.
2. The summary mentions that Lindegaard has made just 19 league appearances for Manchester United this season, but the article states that he has made just 19 league appearances in five seasons at the club, not just this season.
3. The summary states that Lindegaard is a goalkeeper for Manchester United, but the article does not mention his position as a goalkeeper. Instead, it refers to him as a "United goalkeeper" without specifying his position.
4. The summary mentions that Lindegaard has been linked with a move to FC Midtjylland in January, but the article does not mention anything about this.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations that do not match the information provided in the article.

1. The summary mentions that Lindegaard has made just 19 league appearances for Manchester United this season, but the article states that he has made just 19 league appearances in five seasons at the club, not just this season.
2. The summary does not mention that Lindegaard tied the knot with the stunning model last year and the couple have a son together
3. The summary does not mention the name of the swedish model which is mentioned in the article
