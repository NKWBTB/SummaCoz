Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Usain Bolt will compete at the IAAF/BTC World Relays in the Bahamas next month.
2. The article confirms that Bolt will compete at the relay championship on May 2 and 3 as part of the Jamaican team.
3. However, the summary does not mention the specific dates of May 2 and 3, which is inconsistent with the article.
4. Additionally, the summary states that the competition will be announced on May 2 and 3, which is not accurate as the competition has already been confirmed to take place on those dates.
5. Finally, the summary does not mention that Bolt will be part of the Jamaican team, which is a key detail that is included in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits key details, provides incorrect information, and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
