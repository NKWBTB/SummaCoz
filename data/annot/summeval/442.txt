    Article: 
    There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.  Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans. The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium .

     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Inconsistent details: The summary mentions "Yorkshire side" beating "Doncaster Rovers" at "Doncaster", but the article does not mention any team named "Yorkshire side". Instead, it refers to "Doncaster Rovers" playing against "Fleetwood Town".
2. Incorrect match outcome: The summary states that "Doncaster Rovers" beat "Fleetwood Town", but the article states that the two teams played out a 0-0 draw.
3. Incorrect match highlights: The summary mentions "match highlights" of the game, but the article states that the match was a goalless draw and there were no highlights to be made.
4. Inconsistent tone: The summary has a more positive tone, mentioning "the most ardent fan" and "a must-see video", while the article has a more neutral tone and focuses on the lack of goals and the challenge faced by the media team.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect details, a wrong match outcome, and an inconsistent tone.
