    Article: 
    Former Holland forward and assistant coach Patrick Kluivert has made a winning start in World Cup qualifying as coach of Curacao. The Caribbean island team advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF for the 2018 tournament late Tuesday. Curacao drew 2-2 in a second-leg match at Montserrat to win 4-3 on aggregate. Kluivert's team won 2-1 on Saturday in Willemstad. Patrick Kluivert has helped Curacao progress to the next stage of 2018 World Cup qualification . Former Holland assistant Kluivert (far right) worked with Louis van Gaal (centre) at the 2014 World Cup . The first-round encounter was headed to extra time on Tuesday until former Holland Under 21 international Charlton Vicento scored in the 87th minute, five minutes after coming on as a substitute. Curacao face Cuba in the next round, on June 8 and 16. Kluivert, whose mother is from Curacao, was a World Cup losing semi-finalist in 1998 as a player, and last year as assistant to coach Louis van Gaal. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Louis van Gaal scored in the 87th minute, but the article does not mention Louis van Gaal scoring at all.
2. The summary states that Curacao drew 2-2 in the match at Montserrat, but the article states that Curacao won 2-1 in the second-leg match at Montserrat.
3. The summary states that Curacao advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF for the 2018 tournament late Tuesday, but the article states that Curacao advanced to the next stage of 2018 World Cup qualification, which is not the same thing.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reasons for these inconsistencies are:

* Louis van Gaal did not score in the match, so the statement about him scoring is incorrect.
* The score of the match was not a draw, but rather a win for Curacao, so the statement about the score being 2-2 is incorrect.
* The article is talking about Curacao advancing to the next stage of World Cup qualification, not CONCACAF qualification, so the statement about the qualifying round is incorrect.
