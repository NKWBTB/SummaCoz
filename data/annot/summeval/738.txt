Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Louis van Gaal scored in the 87th minute, but the article does not mention Louis van Gaal scoring at all.
2. The summary also states that Curacao advanced to the second qualifying round, but the article states that Curacao drew 2-2 in the second-leg match and won 4-3 on aggregate, not that they advanced to the next round.
3. The summary mentions that the match was headed to extra time, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that Charlton Vicento scored in the 87th minute, but the article states that he came on as a substitute in the 87th minute, not that he scored.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
