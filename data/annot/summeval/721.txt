    Article: 
    Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save. Fortunately for the young England player, it didn't prove costly as Mirallas went on to score the only goal of the game after 29 minutes.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ross Barkley has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League, but the article does not support this claim. In fact, the article states that Leighton Baines has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts, not Ross Barkley.
2. The summary also states that Ross Barkley took the 10th minute penalty for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Barkley took the penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch, and that Baines has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts.
3. The summary does not mention that Leighton Baines was on the pitch and available to take the penalty, which is a key detail that is included in the article.
4. The summary states that Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club, but the article does not support this claim. In fact, the article states that Martinez insisted that Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday, and that Baines was happy to give Barkley that responsibility.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that are significant enough to change the meaning of the summary. Specifically, the summary misstates the identity of the player who has scored the most penalties in the Premier League, and it fails to mention the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch and his availability to take the penalty.
