     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the guard slipped on a manhole cover, but the article does not mention any manhole cover. Instead, the article states that the guard slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots.
2. The summary states that the guard lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box, but the article does not mention the guard knocking his bearskin or sliding sideways.
3. The summary states that the guard dropped his rifle, but the article does not mention the guard dropping his rifle.
4. The summary states that the incident was caught on a manhole cover, but the article does not mention any manhole cover. Instead, the article states that the incident was caught on a tourist's camera.
