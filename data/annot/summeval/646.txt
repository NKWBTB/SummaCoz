    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Bob Katter accused the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after being accused of domestic violence, but the article does not mention anything about the Queensland Government assuming Billy Gordon would quit. Instead, the article states that Bob Katter accused the Government of thinking Billy Gordon was a "little black puppet on a string."
2. The summary does not mention the term "black puppet" which is used by Bob Katter in the article. This is a significant omission as the term is central to the controversy surrounding Katter's statement.
3. The summary states that Bob Katter said he has been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, but the article does not mention anything about racism or racist attitudes.
4. The summary states that Mr. Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week, but the article states that he announced he would remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, which is not consistent with the summary's statement.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits key details, misrepresents others, and includes information that is not present in the article.
