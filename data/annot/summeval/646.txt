Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Bob Katter said the government believes Mr. Gordon would quit after being accused of domestic violence. However, the article states that Mr. Katter accused the government of assuming Mr. Gordon would resign because they thought he was a "little black puppet on a string."
2. The summary does not include Mr. Katter's statement about the government thinking Mr. Gordon was a "little black puppet on a string." This statement is a key part of the article and is not present in the summary.
3. The summary states that Mr. Katter said he had been subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that Mr. Gordon was forced to quit the Labor Party last week, but the article states that he announced he would remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, which is not consistent with the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits key details and includes inaccurate information. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article.
