    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Paul Merson criticized Andros Townsend's call-up to the England squad, but the article states that Merson initially angered Townsend for writing in his Sky Sports column that "if Andros Townsend can get in (the England team) then it opens it up to anybody." This implies that Merson's criticism was not of Townsend's call-up, but rather of the fact that he thought Townsend's inclusion in the squad set a precedent for other players to be included.
2. The summary states that Townsend hit back at Merson on Twitter after scoring for England against Italy, but the article states that Townsend did not respond to Merson's initial criticism. Instead, it was Merson who responded to Townsend's goal with another dig at the player.
3. The summary states that Merson said Townsend should not have been in Roy Hodgson's squad, but the article states that Merson's criticism was based on his opinion that Townsend should not have been included in the squad because he was substituted after half an hour at Manchester United in front of Roy Hodgson. This implies that Merson's criticism was not based on Townsend's ability or performance, but rather on his personal opinion about the player's inclusion in the squad.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents Merson's criticism of Townsend and overstates the extent to which Townsend responded to Merson's comments.
