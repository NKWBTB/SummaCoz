</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Paul Merson criticized Andros Townsend's call-up to the England squad, saying that he should not have been in Roy Hodgson's squad.
2. However, the article states that Merson initially angered Townsend for writing in his Sky Sports column that "if Andros Townsend can get in (the England team) then it opens it up to anybody." This implies that Merson was not against Townsend's call-up to the squad, but rather was making a point about the team's selection criteria.
3. The summary also states that Townsend hit back at Merson on Twitter after scoring for England, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article states that any bad feeling between the pair seemed to have passed, and Merson was unable to resist having another dig at Townsend after Tottenham drew at Turf Moor.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it omits important details and misrepresents Merson's and Townsend's interactions. Specifically, the summary makes it seem like Merson was against Townsend's call-up to the squad, when in fact he was simply making a point about the team's selection criteria. Additionally, the summary states that Townsend hit back at Merson on Twitter, but this is not supported by the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary does not mention Merson admitting his mistakes against Townsend while the article does.
2. The summary fails to mention that Merson initially angered Townsend for writing in his Sky Sports column that "if Andros Townsend can get in (the England team) then it opens it up to anybody."
