    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Bob Katter called Billy Gordon a "black puppet on a string."

Inconsistency: The article does not mention Bob Katter using the phrase "black puppet on a string" to describe Billy Gordon. Instead, the article quotes Katter as saying that the Queensland Government thought they had a "little black puppet on a string."

Step 2: The summary implies that Bob Katter's statement was a response to a bizarre situation, with the implication that Katter's statement was also bizarre.

Inconsistency: The article does not describe the situation as bizarre, and Bob Katter's statement is presented as a legitimate response to the situation.

Step 3: The summary states that the left-leaning loons stayed silent in response to Bob Katter's statement.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention any left-leaning individuals or groups staying silent in response to Bob Katter's statement. Instead, the article presents Katter's statement as sparking criticism on social media.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents Bob Katter's statement, misinterprets the situation, and adds unnecessary political leanings to the narrative.
