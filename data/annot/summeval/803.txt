    Henry thinks Arsenal need four players in the summer 'I think he's in the best form of his career and he's scoring a lot of goals, but he's not leading the team to the title yet. 'He's not leading the team to the title yet. It's a question of him. 

    Article: 
    Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack . Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry . Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the summary statement

The summary statement is: "Henry thinks Arsenal need four players in the summer."

Step 2: Identify the inconsistent information

The inconsistent information is: "Giroud may need replacing" and "Arsenal cannot win the league with Giroud as their first-choice striker."

Step 3: Analyze the inconsistency

The summary statement suggests that Henry believes Arsenal need four new players, but the article states that Henry believes Giroud may need replacing, which implies that Arsenal already have a good striker. Additionally, the article states that Henry questions whether Arsenal can win the league with Giroud as their first-choice striker, which is inconsistent with the summary statement's assertion that Arsenal need four new players.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistency

The inconsistency arises because the summary statement focuses on the number of new players Arsenal need, while the article focuses on the quality of their current striker, Giroud. Henry's comments in the article suggest that Arsenal may need to replace Giroud with a top-quality striker in order to win the league, rather than simply signing four new players.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it oversimplifies Henry's comments and fails to capture the nuances of his analysis.
