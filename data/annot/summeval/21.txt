    Summary: 
    We now know that antibiotics are fattening our children (file photo) 'We should be concerned that the widespread use of antibiotics in infancy may be contributing to the obesity epidemic.' The study was funded by the Finnish National Foundation for Child Health and the European Union. 

    Article: 
    Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

1. The summary states that antibiotics are fattening our children, but the article does not say that. Instead, it suggests that antibiotics may be contributing to the obesity epidemic, but it does not directly state that antibiotics are fattening children.

2. The summary mentions that the study found that children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight, but the article does not mention this specific finding. The article only states that the study found that antibiotics were associated with increased body mass in healthy children.

3. The summary implies that the study proved that antibiotics cause weight gain, but the article does not say that. Instead, it states that the study found an association between antibiotic use and increased body mass, but it does not prove causation.

4. The summary mentions that the study was funded by the Finnish National Foundation for Child Health and the European Union, but this information is not in the article.

5. Finally, the summary states that the study found that antibiotics are fattening our children, which is not supported by the article. The article states that the study found an association between antibiotic use and increased body mass, but it does not make a direct statement about the cause of the weight gain.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes direct claims that are not supported by the article, such as the statement that antibiotics are fattening our children. Additionally, the summary implies that the study proved causation, when the article only states an association.
