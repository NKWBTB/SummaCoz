    Article: 
    (CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. "The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from," Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.

     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Date discrepancy: The summary states that the fires started on April 14, but the article states that the fires started in southeastern Siberia "over the weekend" and were reported on April 17.
2. Location discrepancy: The summary states that the fires destroyed dozens of villages in the region of Siberia, while the article states that the fires were in southeastern Siberia and destroyed dozens of villages in the region.
3. Cause of fires: The summary states that the fires were started by farmers burning grass in their fields, but the article does not mention this as the cause of the fires. Instead, it states that the fires were started by strong winds and spread quickly throughout the region.
4. Smoke effect: The summary states that the smoke from the fires was picked up by atmospheric winds and carried to the Pacific Northwest, causing intense red sunsets. The article does mention that the smoke from the fires was carried by winds to other regions, but it does not specifically state that this caused intense red sunsets.
5. Timing: The summary states that the fiery sunsets were seen on April 14, but the article states that the sunsets were seen over the weekend and into the following week.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains specific details that are not mentioned in the article, and it omits other important details that are mentioned in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The article states that the fires were started by farmers burning grass in their fields, but the summary does not mention this as the cause of the fires. 
2. The summary does not explain the reasoning behind the fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday while the article does. The article state that the cause of the fiery sunset is the fire in Siberia.
