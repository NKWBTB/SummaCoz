    Article: 
    (CNN)HBO just whetted our appetite for a new season of "True Detective." The network released a teaser video for  season 2 of the critically acclaimed show, and it looks intense. Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch star in the new season, which premieres June 21. Here's the plot synopsis, according to Den of Geek: . "A bizarre murder brings together three law-enforcement officers and a career criminal, each of whom must navigate a web of conspiracy and betrayal in the scorched landscapes of California. Colin Farrell is Ray Velcoro, a compromised detective in the all-industrial City of Vinci, LA County. Vince Vaughn plays Frank Semyon, a criminal and entrepreneur in danger of losing his life's work, while his wife and closest ally (Kelly Reilly), struggles with his choices and her own. Rachel McAdams is Ani Bezzerides, a Ventura County Sheriff's detective often at odds with the system she serves, while Taylor Kitsch plays Paul Woodrugh, a war veteran and motorcycle cop for the California Highway Patrol who discovers a crime scene which triggers an investigation involving three law enforcement groups, multiple criminal collusions, and billions of dollars." Yes, please. The first season starred Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as a pair of Louisiana State Police detectives investigating the death of a young woman. The crime drama proved to be a runaway hit, and the season 1 finale crashed the HBO Go site in March 2014. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions a teaser video for season 2 of the show, but the article does not mention a teaser video. Instead, the article provides a plot synopsis for season 2.
2. The summary mentions a new season of "True Detective," but the article does not confirm this. Instead, the article provides information about the cast and plot of season 2.
3. The summary mentions that the show is set in California, but the article does not mention this. The article only provides information about the setting of season 2, which is the scorched landscapes of California.
4. The summary mentions that the show will premiere on June 21, but the article does not mention a specific premiere date. Instead, the article provides information about the cast and plot of season 2.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides information that is not present in the article, such as a teaser video and a specific premiere date. Additionally, the summary contains information that is not accurate, such as the setting of the show being mentioned as California, when the article only provides information about the setting of season 2.
