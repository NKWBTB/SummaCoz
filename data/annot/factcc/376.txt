    Summary: 
    salehi and his wife, yeganeh salehi, were released on bail in october. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)Jason Rezaian has sat in jail in Iran for nearly nine months. The Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran was arrested in July on unspecified allegations. It took more than four months for a judge to hear charges against him. They remained publicly undisclosed until last week. The Iranian-American will be tried soon on espionage, Tehran's chief justice said. He is accused of economic spying, the Post reported, citing Iranian state media. The Washington Post did not mince words on the allegation. "Any charges of that sort would be absurd, the product of fertile and twisted imaginations," the paper said in a statement. The State Department also reacted with term "absurd" after hearing of reports in Iran's press about the charges. "If the reports are true, these charges are absurd, should be immediately dismissed and Jason should be immediately freed so that he can return to his family," the State Department official said. Since officers picked up Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, on July 22 at their home, the Post, the State Department and Rezaian's family have protested and called for his release. Salehi was released on bail in October. Rezaian was denied bail. And for months, he was denied access to proper legal representation, his family has said. Boxing great Muhammad Ali, also an American Muslim, appealed to Tehran last month to give Rezaian full access to legal representation and free him on bail. "To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work," Ali said in a religiously worded statement. The journalist has also not been allowed to see visitors aside from his wife and has endured long interrogations, family members have said. In December, after a 10-hour hearing, Rezaian signed a paper to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him, the Post reported. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion. He said, "Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms." More on detained Americans . CNN's Sara Mazloumsaki and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Jason Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were released on bail in October.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention anything about Jason Rezaian being released on bail. Only Yeganeh Salehi was released on bail in October, according to the article.

Step 2: The summary states that Jason Rezaian was denied bail.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention anything about Jason Rezaian being denied bail. In fact, the article states that Yeganeh Salehi was released on bail in October, but Jason Rezaian was not.

Step 3: The summary states that Jason Rezaian has been denied access to proper legal representation.

Inconsistency: The article does not mention anything about Jason Rezaian being denied access to proper legal representation. In fact, the article states that the journalist has not been allowed to see visitors aside from his wife.

Step 4: The summary states that the charges against Jason Rezaian are absurd.

Inconsistency: While the article does quote the Washington Post as saying that the charges against Jason Rezaian are absurd, the article does not provide any direct statement from Jason Rezaian or his family members making this claim.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that Jason Rezaian was released on bail, when in fact he was not. Additionally, the summary states that he has been denied access to proper legal representation, which is not supported by the article.
