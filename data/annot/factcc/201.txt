<Article>
(CNN)It was a typical practice day for the Washington University of rowing team, but then danger came from beneath. The scene was Creve Coeur Lake outside of St. Louis early Friday morning. The team's boat got near the dock, when suddenly a swarm of Asian carp emerged from the water and went on the attack, some even going into the boat. Team member Devin Patel described the moment of terror: "The fish was flopping on my legs. It was so slippery that I couldn't get a grip on it." Patel screamed at teammate Yoni David, "Yoni, get it off me!" Thankfully, no rowers were injured during the ordeal, but the strong smell of fish lingered in the moments afterward.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the team was on a typical practice day, but suddenly a swarm of Asian carp emerged from the water and attacked the team's boat.
2. The word "swarm" is not consistent with the summary, which simply states "it was a swarm day."
3. The article describes the scene as one of terror and chaos, with the fish flopping on the team members' legs and a strong fishy smell lingering afterward.
4. The summary does not capture any of these details and instead uses the word "swarm" in a way that is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the events described in the article. The word "swarm" is used in a way that is not supported by the context of the article, and the summary does not capture the chaos and terror of the scene described in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that "it was a swarm day for the washington university of rowing team."
2. The article states that the team was on a typical practice day, but suddenly a swarm of Asian carp emerged from the water and attacked the team's boat.
3. The summary uses the word "swarm" in a way that is not supported by the article.
