    it was a swarm day for the washington university of rowing team. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)It was a typical practice day for the Washington University of rowing team, but then danger came from beneath. The scene was Creve Coeur Lake outside of St. Louis early Friday morning. The team's boat got near the dock, when suddenly a swarm of Asian carp emerged from the water and went on the attack, some even going into the boat. Team member Devin Patel described the moment of terror: "The fish was flopping on my legs. It was so slippery that I couldn't get a grip on it." Patel screamed at teammate Yoni David, "Yoni, get it off me!" Thankfully, no rowers were injured during the ordeal, but the strong smell of fish lingered in the moments afterward.

     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions a "swarm day" for the rowing team, but the article does not use this language. Instead, it describes a sudden and unexpected attack by Asian carp.
2. The summary implies that the team experienced a traumatic event, but the article does not describe any injuries or lasting effects. The team members are only described as "shaken" and experiencing a "strong smell of fish."
3. The summary mentions the team's boat getting near the dock, but the article does not mention the team being near the dock or any specific location. The attack by the Asian carp occurs "early Friday morning" in Creve Coeur Lake, without any additional context.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the severity of the event and adds details that are not present in the article. The article describes a surprising and unusual attack by Asian carp, but the summary presents it as a traumatic and dangerous event for the rowing team.
