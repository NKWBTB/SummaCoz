</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Thai Airways is featuring the hit show "Adventure Time" on their new livery.
2. However, the article states that Thai Smile, a subsidiary of Thai Airways, is partnering with Cartoon Network Amazone to feature the characters from the show on their plane, not Thai Airways itself.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Thai Airways is directly associated with the "Adventure Time" theme, when in fact it is only one of their subsidiaries that is doing so.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions that "Thai Airways subsidiary Thai Airways". This is not accurate.
2. The article states that Thai Smile, a subsidiary of Thai Airways.
3. The summary has grammatical errors making it confusing.
