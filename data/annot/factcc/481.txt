    Summary: 
    the iranian-american will be tried soon on espionage, tehran's chief says. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)Jason Rezaian has sat in jail in Iran for nearly nine months. The Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran was arrested in July on unspecified allegations. It took more than four months for a judge to hear charges against him. They remained publicly undisclosed until last week. The Iranian-American will be tried soon on espionage, Tehran's chief justice said. He is accused of economic spying, the Post reported, citing Iranian state media. The Washington Post did not mince words on the allegation. "Any charges of that sort would be absurd, the product of fertile and twisted imaginations," the paper said in a statement. The State Department also reacted with term "absurd" after hearing of reports in Iran's press about the charges. "If the reports are true, these charges are absurd, should be immediately dismissed and Jason should be immediately freed so that he can return to his family," the State Department official said. Since officers picked up Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, on July 22 at their home, the Post, the State Department and Rezaian's family have protested and called for his release. Salehi was released on bail in October. Rezaian was denied bail. And for months, he was denied access to proper legal representation, his family has said. Boxing great Muhammad Ali, also an American Muslim, appealed to Tehran last month to give Rezaian full access to legal representation and free him on bail. "To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work," Ali said in a religiously worded statement. The journalist has also not been allowed to see visitors aside from his wife and has endured long interrogations, family members have said. In December, after a 10-hour hearing, Rezaian signed a paper to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him, the Post reported. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion. He said, "Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms." More on detained Americans . CNN's Sara Mazloumsaki and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Jason Rezaian will be tried soon on espionage charges, while the article states that he has already been denied bail and has been in jail for nearly nine months. This suggests that the trial has already taken place or is imminent, but the article does not mention any trial dates or proceedings.

2. The summary mentions that Rezaian is accused of economic spying, but the article does not provide any information about the specific charges against him. The article only mentions that he was arrested on unspecified allegations and that the charges remained publicly undisclosed until last week.

3. The summary quotes the Washington Post as saying that any charges of espionage would be "absurd," but the article does not include this quote. Instead, the article states that the State Department called the charges "absurd" if they are true.

4. The summary states that Rezaian will be tried soon, but the article does not provide any information about when the trial will take place.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides specific information about the charges against Rezaian and the timing of his trial, which are not present in the article. Additionally, the summary includes a quote from the Washington Post that is not present in the article.
