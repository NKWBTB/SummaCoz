New Delhi  (CNN)An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said. Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means "truth" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider. It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States. The company had about 53,000 employees and operated in 65 countries. After Raju's shock disclosures six years ago, the Indian government fired Satyam's board. In a subsequent state-backed auction, the company was bought by Tech Mahindra, part of the country's Mahindra Group. A heavyweight of the nation's software industry, Raju, 60, has been in jail for the past 32 months. He had founded Satyam in 1987. His company made giant strides as the outsourcing business grew in India in the 1990s.

<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that an Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the pioneer being sentenced to jail. Instead, it mentions that Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of Satyam Computers Services, was sentenced to seven years in jail.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the charges that the pioneer and the nine others were convicted of. The article states that they were convicted of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust, and other charges.
4. The summary does not mention the amount of fine that was imposed on Raju. The article states that he was fined $804,000.
5. The summary does not provide any information about the company's history, its clients, or the impact of the scandal on the company and its employees. The article provides all of this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the sentencing of the pioneer and the charges that they were convicted of. Additionally, the summary does not provide any context or details about the company and the scandal, which are crucial to understanding the story.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states "indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role".
2. The article states "An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed Indiaâ€™s biggest corporate scandal in memory".
3. The inconsistency is that the summary failed to mention the role of the indian software pioneer and the 9 others. This leads to confusion as we do not know what was the cause for the arrest.
