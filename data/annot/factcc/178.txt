    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that MacLachlan is the only cast member for the reboot, but the article states that several original cast members, including Sherilyn Fenn, Sheryl Lee, James Marshall, and Peggy Lipton, have teamed up for a video backing David Lynch in his salary standoff with Showtime. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The article mentions that the original cast members have teamed up for a video campaign to support David Lynch, but the summary does not mention this. This is another indication that the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. The article states that Showtime has renewed 'Shameless' and ordered 'Happyish' to series, but the summary does not mention this. This further supports the conclusion that the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The article mentions that David Lynch has exited the Showtime revival due to a salary dispute, but the summary does not mention this. This is a significant piece of information that is missing from the summary, which again supports the conclusion that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include several key pieces of information, including the original cast members' support for David Lynch, Showtime's renewal of 'Shameless' and order of 'Happyish', and David Lynch's exit from the revival due to a salary dispute.
