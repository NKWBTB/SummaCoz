     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "mega-fans of the plane," but the article does not mention anything about fans of the plane. Instead, it focuses on Thai Smile, a subsidiary of Thai Airways, and their partnership with Cartoon Network Amazone to create an Adventure Time-themed plane.
2. The summary mentions "part of an Thai smile," but there is no such phrase in the article. The correct phrase is "Thai Smile," which is the name of the subsidiary of Thai Airways.
3. The summary mentions "Adventure Time in the skies," but the article does not mention anything about the plane flying in the skies. Instead, it focuses on the unveiling of the Adventure Time-themed plane at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport.
4. The summary mentions "Jake, Finn and the beloved Princess Bubblegum sprawled across an Airbus A320," but the article does not mention Princess Bubblegum. Instead, it mentions that the plane features characters from the show, including Jake and Finn.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, there is no mention of "mega-fans" in the article, and the summary incorrectly states that the plane will be flying in the skies. Additionally, the summary mentions Princess Bubblegum, who is not mentioned in the article.
