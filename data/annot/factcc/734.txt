    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary mentions the trailer beginning with a commentator's voice asking, "Maybe he's just a guy trying to do the right thing."

The article does not mention this line from the trailer. Instead, the article states that the trailer begins with a commentator's voice asking, "Is it really surprising that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy?"

Step 2: The summary mentions Ryan Gosling in talks to star in "Blade Runner" sequel, but the article does not mention this.

Step 3: The summary mentions a blurred image of Ben Affleck's face, but the article does not mention this either.

Step 4: The summary mentions the trailer being set to premiere in Imax theaters on Monday, but the article states that the trailer was leaked online before being taken down.

Step 5: The summary does not mention the film's release date, which is mentioned in the article as March 25, 2016.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes elements that are not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.
