    Summary: 
    deion sanders is a wide receiver at southern methodist university, an aspiring entrepreneur and occasional rapper. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)Deion Sanders is such a dad. The NFL legend called out Deion Sanders Jr. on Twitter for saying he only eats "hood doughnuts." In response, the elder Sanders -- in front of his 912,000 followers -- reminded his son he has a trust fund, a condo and his own clothing line called "Well Off." "You're a Huxtable with a million $ trust fund. Stop the hood stuff!" Sanders followed it up with another tweet that included the hashtags #versacesheets #Huxtable and #Trustfund. Junior is a wide receiver at Southern Methodist University, an aspiring entrepreneur and occasional rapper. His Twitter timeline is a mix of biblical verses, motivational quotes and references to sports, cars, school and Balenciaga shoes. He also has gone on record with his love for "hood doughnuts," or confections from "a place in the hood," saying "if my doughnuts don't come in a plain white box, I don't want them!" His father promptly put him in his place. Sanders Jr. seemed to take the public browbeating in stride, retweeting his father's comments. At least he knew better than to delete them. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's the reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Deion Sanders is a wide receiver at Southern Methodist University, an aspiring entrepreneur, and occasional rapper.

2. However, the article states that Deion Sanders Jr. is the wide receiver at Southern Methodist University, an aspiring entrepreneur, and occasional rapper, not Deion Sanders himself.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes the son's characteristics to the father.

4. The article clearly states that Deion Sanders Jr. is the one who is a wide receiver, aspiring entrepreneur, and occasional rapper, while the father, Deion Sanders, is a former NFL legend who is now a Twitter user with 912,000 followers.

5. The summary does not provide any information about the father's career or characteristics, other than the fact that he has a trust fund, a condo, and a clothing line called "Well Off."

6. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not provide a consistent overview of the information presented in the article.
