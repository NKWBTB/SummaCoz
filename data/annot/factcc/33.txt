    Summary: 
    yazidis live in iraqi town of sinjar and fled isis in august. 

    Article: 
    Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan (CNN)In the canvas expanse of the Shariya refugee camp, thousands of Yazidis live within hearing distance of one of Iraqi Kurdistan's frontlines with ISIS. The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot. But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves. In its fourth edition of "Dabiq," the ISIS online magazine, an article titled "The revival of slavery before the hour," outlines the group's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis. "One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar (infidels) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah," the article reads. We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things. "They separated all of us," she says. "They dragged us away by our hair. They took married women, young ones. The youngest with us was just 10.  We were all crying. "They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family." ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK . For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice. The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held. "They would line about 50 of us up at a time, in rows of 10.  They would say don't move, don't cry or we will beat you. The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased," she recalls. She was eventually chosen, part of a group of 25.  From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS . Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves. "They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months. She was wearing the black niqab. They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her," Hanan says. "The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me, they cuffed me and raped me." Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape. That night they crawled out the bedroom window. "The fourth girl jumped out, I was the fifth. I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight," she tells me. "They caught the last two girls." They ran, and somehow evaded capture.  Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory. "If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking," Hanan says. Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps to explain why:

Step 1: Identify the main idea of the summary.
The main idea of the summary is that Yazidis fled ISIS in August.

Step 2: Identify the main idea of the article.
The main idea of the article is that ISIS enslaved Yazidi women and girls, and they are still being forced to endure horrific conditions.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistency.
The inconsistency is that the summary does not mention anything about ISIS enslaving Yazidi women and girls, while the article discusses this topic in detail.

Step 4: Analyze why the inconsistency exists.
The inconsistency exists because the summary is focused on the Yazidis fleeing ISIS in August, while the article is focused on the enslavement of Yazidi women and girls by ISIS. The two topics are not related, and therefore, the summary does not mention the enslavement.

Step 5: Evaluate the significance of the inconsistency.
The inconsistency is significant because it highlights the different focuses of the two texts. The summary is focused on the Yazidis' flight from ISIS, while the article is focused on the enslavement of Yazidi women and girls. This difference in focus is important because it highlights the severity of the situation and the different aspects of the conflict that need to be addressed.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the enslavement of Yazidi women and girls by ISIS, while the article discusses this topic in detail. The inconsistency exists because the two texts have different focuses, and it is significant because it highlights the different aspects of the conflict that need to be addressed.
