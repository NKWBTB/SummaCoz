    Summary: 
    the track "country grammar" has been charged with felony possession of drug paraphernalia. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)Hip-hop star Nelly has been arrested on drug charges in Tennessee after a state trooper pulled over the private bus in which he was traveling, authorities said. The 40-year-old rapper from St. Louis, who shot to fame 15 years ago with the track "Country Grammar," has been charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security said. The state trooper stopped the bus carrying Nelly and five other people on Interstate 40 in Putnam County on Saturday because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, according to Tennessee authorities. The trooper was about to conduct an inspection of the bus, a Prevost motor coach, when he "noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle," authorities said in a statement. Two troopers then searched the bus, finding "five colored crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine, as well as a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia," the statement said. The search also turned up several handguns and 100 small Ziploc bags, which the statement said are commonly used for selling drugs. The guns included a gold-plated .50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, a .45-caliber Taurus pistol and a .500 Smith & Wesson magnum. Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, was taken to the Putnam County Jail along with another passenger. He later posted bond and left the jail, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office said. CNN couldn't immediately reach Nelly's representatives for comment Saturday. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the track "Country Grammar" has been charged with felony possession of drug paraphernalia, but the article does not mention the track at all. The article only mentions Nelly, the rapper, and his charges.
2. The summary mentions that the charges include felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia, but the article only mentions the charges of felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia.
3. The summary mentions that the state trooper stopped the bus because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, but the article does not mention this reason for the stop. The article only states that the trooper stopped the bus because he noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle.
4. The summary mentions that the search turned up several handguns, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that the search turned up a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as the track "Country Grammar" being charged and the search turning up handguns. It also omits some details that are present in the article, such as the reason for the stop and the specific types of drugs found.
