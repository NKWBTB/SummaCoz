    sterling has ordered v. stiviano to pay back $2.6 m in gifts after his wife sued. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle "Shelly" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. "This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress," attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. "It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts." Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. "In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people," Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. "Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me," Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Donald Sterling's wife sued V. Stiviano for $2.6 million in gifts, but the article states that it was Sterling's wife, Rochelle "Shelly" Sterling, who sued Stiviano for $2.6 million in gifts that her husband had given to Stiviano.
2. The summary implies that Stiviano was ordered to pay back the gifts, but the article states that a judge ordered Stiviano to pay back the gifts, with the ruling being a victory for the Sterling family.
3. The summary mentions that Stiviano received "uber-expensive items" from Sterling, but the article does not mention the value of the gifts or the specific items that Stiviano received.
4. The summary states that the court decision sets a precedent for the injured spouse to recover damages from the recipient of the gifts, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or misstates several key details, including the fact that it was Sterling's wife who sued Stiviano, the value of the gifts, and the specific items that Stiviano received. Additionally, the summary implies that Stiviano was ordered to pay back the gifts, which is not explicitly stated in the article.
