    Summary: 
    this is the lowest ebola epidemic in history has died down. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)Over the last year more than 25,000 people, a population about the size of Key West, Florida, have fought Ebola infections. More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the "most severe public health emergency seen in modern times" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. "Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks," the latest WHO report said.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the Ebola epidemic has died down, but the article states that dozens of new cases are still being reported each week.
2. The summary suggests that the epidemic is over, but the article highlights ongoing transmission and the possibility of new infections in the coming weeks.
3. The summary does not mention the ongoing challenges in Guinea, where 19 confirmed deaths and 21 unsafe burials were reported, which is a significant portion of the remaining Ebola cases.
4. The summary does not mention the surplus treatment facilities in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which suggests that the epidemic is not fully under control.

Overall, the summary presents an overly optimistic view of the Ebola situation, while the article provides a more balanced and accurate picture of the ongoing challenges and risks associated with the epidemic.
