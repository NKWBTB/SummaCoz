(CNN)Over the last year more than 25,000 people, a population about the size of Key West, Florida, have fought Ebola infections. More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the "most severe public health emergency seen in modern times" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. "Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks," the latest WHO report said.

<Summary>
this is the lowest ebola epidemic in history has died down.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "dozens are still newly infected each week." This contradicts the summary's claim that the epidemic has died down.
2. The article also mentions that there were 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola in the week of April 5, which is not a low number.
3. The article states that while the number of cases has fallen in Liberia and Sierra Leone, there are still reports of unsafe burials and unknown chains of transmission in Guinea, indicating that the epidemic is not yet under control.
4. The article concludes by stating that while surveillance is improving, there is still a risk of new infections in the coming weeks.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is not accurate to say that the Ebola epidemic is the lowest in history or that it has died down. Instead, the article suggests that while progress has been made, there is still a significant risk of new infections and ongoing transmission of the virus.
