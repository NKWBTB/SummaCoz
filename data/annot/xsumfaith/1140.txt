<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    three people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man died following a head-on crash in south yorkshire. 

    Article: 
    Craig Nelson, who was also known as Craig Preston, was found at the Woodhead Tunnels off the A628 in Derbyshire at 11:00 BST on Monday.
A post-mortem found the 34-year-old from Wath-Upon-Dearn in Rotherham died as a result of head injuries.
A man, 41, and a woman, 23, were arrested in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police and remain in custody. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that three people have been arrested on suspicion of murder, but the article only mentions two people being arrested (a man and a woman). Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary mentions a head-on crash, but the article does not mention any crash. Instead, it states that Craig Nelson was found dead at the Woodhead Tunnels. Therefore, the summary is not supported by the article.
3. The summary mentions Craig Nelson dying as a result of head injuries, which is consistent with the article. However, the summary does not mention the location where Craig Nelson was found, which is specified in the article as the Woodhead Tunnels.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article (a head-on crash) and omits other important details (the location where Craig Nelson was found).

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that three people have been arrested on suspicion of murder, but the article only mentions two people being arrested.
2. The summary mentions a head-on crash, but the article does not mention any crash.
