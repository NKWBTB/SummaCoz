</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "climber",
  "bridgend. been named.",
  "sea",
  "bridgend. been named"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "climber" - The article does not mention anything about a climber. The rescued person was a rider, not a climber. Therefore, this word is not consistent with the article.
2. "bridgend. been named." - The article does not mention the name of the location where the rescue took place. The correct location is Sker Beach, near Kenfig Nature Reserve. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
3. "sea" - The article does not mention the sea. The rescue took place on the beach, not in the sea. Therefore, this word is not consistent with the article.
4. "bridgend. been named" - As mentioned earlier, the correct location is Sker Beach, near Kenfig Nature Reserve, not Bridgend. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, specifically with regard to the identity of the rescued person, the location of the rescue, and the type of environment where the rescue took place.
