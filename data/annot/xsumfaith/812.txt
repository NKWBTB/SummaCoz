    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the climber was airlifted to hospital after being rescued from the sea off the coast of Bridgend.
2. However, the article states that the RNLI crew and coastguard search and rescue helicopter were sent to Sker Beach, near Kenfig Nature Reserve, which is on the coast of Bridgend.
3. The article does not mention anything about the climber being rescued from the sea. Instead, it states that the rider had head injuries and was very cold from lying unconscious on wet sand at Sker Beach.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the climber was rescued from the sea, while the article only mentions a rescue operation at Sker Beach.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it exaggerates the location of the rescue operation and implies that the climber was rescued from the sea, when in fact the rescue operation only took place on land at Sker Beach.
