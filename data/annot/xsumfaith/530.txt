    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the police arrested a man and seized cannabis plants with an estimated value of â‚¬750,000 in County Meath.
2. The article states that the plants were found in a warehouse near Ashbourne on Saturday morning, and that the man was arrested at the scene.
3. However, the article does not mention the estimated value of the cannabis plants.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (the estimated value of the cannabis plants).

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it includes extra information that is not supported by the article.
