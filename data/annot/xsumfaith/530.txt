<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the plants were found in a warehouse near Ashbourne, while the summary states that the plants were found in County Meath. This is a contradiction, as Ashbourne is located in Derbyshire, England, while County Meath is a county in the Republic of Ireland.
2. The article does not mention the estimated value of the cannabis plants, while the summary states that the plants have an estimated value of 750,000 euros (# 530,000). This is a significant inconsistency, as the article does not provide any information about the value of the seized plants.
3. The article states that the man was arrested at the scene, while the summary does not mention any arrests. This is another inconsistency, as the article explicitly states that a man was arrested, while the summary does not mention any arrests.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains multiple inconsistencies and inaccuracies. The article does not mention the estimated value of the seized plants, and it does not state that the arrests took place in County Meath. Therefore, the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content.
