    Summary: 
    beauty and the beast is to be screened in malaysia after authorities found it was " too gay ". 

    Article: 
    The much-anticipated film sparked controversy last week after it emerged it would feature a "gay moment".
It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday, but Disney said it was being held for a "review" of its content.
The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with "a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film".
Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is "ridiculous".
A new release date has yet to be announced.   The live-action remake was granted a "P13 parental guidance classification".
"We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened," LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said.
"However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not."
Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance.
Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the "exclusively gay moment" in the film.
It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story.
The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it "stupid and laughable".
"Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes," wrote a Twitter user in a tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the film was banned in Malaysia because it is "too gay", but the article does not mention this as the reason for the ban. Instead, the article states that the film was held for a "review" of its content due to a "gay moment" in the film.
2. The summary implies that the film was banned because of its portrayal of homosexuality, but the article does not support this interpretation. The article only mentions that the film was held for a "review" of its content, without specifying what the issue is.
3. The summary mentions that the film was approved for screening with a "minor edit", but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) approved the film but did not specify any edits.
4. The summary states that the film was banned in Malaysia, but the article does not support this interpretation. The article states that the film was held for a "review" of its content, but does not mention a ban.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the reason for the film's delay in Malaysia and implies that the film was banned due to its portrayal of homosexuality, which is not supported by the article.
