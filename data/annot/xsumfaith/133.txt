</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Real Madrid have signed Alvaro Morata on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
2. However, the article states that Morata currently plays for Juventus and that Real Madrid have an option to buy him back for up to 30m euros (£23m).
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Morata has signed for Real Madrid when, in fact, he is currently playing for Juventus and Real Madrid have not signed him.
4. The summary is also incorrect in stating that the fee for Morata's transfer is undisclosed, when the article clearly states that the fee is up to 30m euros (£23m).
