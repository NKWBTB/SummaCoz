    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Real Madrid have signed Alvaro Morata on a four-year deal, but the article does not mention anything about Morata signing a four-year deal with Real Madrid. Instead, the article mentions that Morata joined Juventus in 2014 on a two-year loan deal with an option for Real to buy him back for up to 30 million euros.
2. The summary states that Morata is a Real Madrid striker, but the article states that Morata played for Juventus from 2014 to 2016 and scored 27 goals in two years for the Italian club.
3. The summary states that Morata has signed a four-year deal with Real Madrid, but the article does not mention the length of Morata's contract with Juventus or his move to Real Madrid.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides more accurate information about Morata's transfer history and his time at Juventus, but the summary presents a different and inconsistent narrative.
