    Summary: 
    a major study has suggested the long-term future of the main rail line between london and the south of england could be reopening to the public 

    Article: 
    The report focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK.
The line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms.
Network Rail said the study would be "key" to long-term developments.
The report, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, said that 10% of journeys on the line, which was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014, could be affected by 2040.
The report said adverse weather disrupted the line about 10 days per year, but according to sea-level predictions that could rise to almost 40 by 2040 and up to 120 by 2100.
Academics from Plymouth University, the University of Leeds and the University of York identified a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years.
The academics said there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales, south-east England, the Cumbrian coast and Scotland.
Dr David Dawson, from the University of Leeds, said the long-term future of the line was "really worrying".
The report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds.
Network Rail said it hoped to develop "long-term interventions" to "secure the future" of the line.
The Department for Transport said it had invested Â£31m into improving the resilience of the route and was "exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area".
In January, the prime minister backed a new Okehampton railway route as the "most resilient" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions a "major study" suggesting the long-term future of the Dawlish to Teignmouth line could be reopening to the public, but the article does not mention any such study. Instead, the article focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the line and the potential for diversions or long-term interventions to secure its future.
2. The summary implies that the line could be reopened to the public, but the article states that the line was closed for two months in 2014 and could be affected by adverse weather conditions in the future. The article does not suggest that the line will be reopened.
3. The summary mentions the prime minister backing a new Okehampton railway route as the "most resilient" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it presents a more optimistic view of the future of the Dawlish to Teignmouth line than the article does. The article focuses on the challenges and potential costs of maintaining the line in the face of sea level rises, while the summary suggests that the line could be reopened to the public.
