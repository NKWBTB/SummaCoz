Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the poverty rate in the US was 15% in 2011, which means that 46.2 million Americans were living in poverty.
2. The article also states that the real median income of households in the US dropped by 1.5%.
3. The article mentions that the average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011 was $23,021 (£14,300).
4. The article states that income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011.
5. The article mentions that the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance fell to 15.7% from 16.3%.
6. The article states that poverty in the US reached a record high in 2010, at 15.1%.

Now, let's compare the summary with the article:

1. The summary states that the number of people living in the UK has risen by more than a third in the three months to March. This is not consistent with the article, as the article is about poverty in the US, not the UK.
2. The summary does not mention any information about poverty rates, income inequality, or the number of people lacking health insurance, which are all key points in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it is about a different topic (the UK) and does not include any of the key points from the article.
