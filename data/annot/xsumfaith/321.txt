    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the number of people living in the UK has risen by more than a third in the three months to March, according to a new report.

This is not consistent with the article, as the article discusses poverty rates and income inequality in the US, not the UK.

2. The article states that the poverty rate in the US was 15% in 2011, meaning 46.2 million Americans were in poverty.

This is not consistent with the summary, as the summary does not mention poverty rates or any other information related to the US.

3. The article also states that the real median income of households in the US dropped by 1.5%.

This is not consistent with the summary, as the summary does not mention any information about income or economic trends.

4. The article mentions that the average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011 was $23,021 (£14,300).

This is not consistent with the summary, as the summary does not mention any information about poverty thresholds or income levels.

5. The article states that income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011, the first time there has been an annual rise in the index since 1993.

This is not consistent with the summary, as the summary does not mention any information about income inequality or the Gini index.

6. The article also states that the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance fell to 15.7% from 16.3%, according to the report.

This is not consistent with the summary, as the summary does not mention any information about health insurance or healthcare.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it discusses a completely different topic (the UK) and does not mention any of the key points or trends discussed in the article (poverty rates, income inequality, and health insurance in the US).
