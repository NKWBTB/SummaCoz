Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "China" - The article mentions "the southern city of Liuzhou in China", but the summary only says "police in southern China". This is inconsistent because the article specifies the location as Liuzhou, while the summary only mentions "southern China" without specifying the location.
2. "seized more than 1,200 bottles" - The article states that "more than 5,300 bottles of alcohol were seized", but the summary says "seized more than 1,200 bottles". This is inconsistent because the article gives a much higher number of bottles seized than the summary.
3. "1,000" - The summary mentions "1,000", but there is no mention of this number in the article. This is inconsistent because the summary introduces a number that is not supported by the article.
4. "police" - The article mentions "police in the Guangxi region" and "the Liuzhou Food and Drug Administration", but the summary only says "police". This is inconsistent because the article mentions multiple authorities, while the summary only mentions one.
5. "local media report" - The article does not mention anything about local media reports. This is inconsistent because the summary introduces a source that is not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary has several inconsistencies with the article, including the location, the number of bottles seized, the authorities involved, and the source of the information.
