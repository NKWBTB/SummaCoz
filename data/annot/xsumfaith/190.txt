Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the investigators seized more than 5,300 bottles of alcohol, but the summary states that the police seized more than 1,000 bottles of alcohol. This is a discrepancy in the number of bottles seized.
2. The article also mentions that the investigators found packets of a white powder called Sildenafil, better known as Viagra, but the summary does not mention this. This is a significant omission, as the discovery of Viagra is a crucial aspect of the article.
3. The article states that the powder was added to three different types of 'baijiu', a popular Chinese spirit, but the summary does not mention this detail.
4. The article provides a value for the seized haul, stating that it was worth up to 700,000 yuan, but the summary does not include this information.
5. The article mentions that China continues to face widespread food safety problems, but the summary does not mention this.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary omits significant details, such as the discovery of Viagra and the addition of the powder to the baijiu, and includes incorrect information, such as the number of bottles seized. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article.
