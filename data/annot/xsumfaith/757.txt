    Summary: 
    a gin distillery in the scottish borders has been given the go-ahead by the scottish borders to create a gin distillery. 

    Article: 
    Lilliard Gin is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.
It comes ahead of a number proposals, which are at various stages of the planning process, to open the region's first whisky distillery since 1837.
Lead distiller Kate Macinnes said the potential to make the Scottish Borders a "region of distilling excellence" was "really exciting".
"Our gin production is on a completely different scale to the other distilleries in development," she said.
"Our still is one of the smallest production stills in the UK, and our entire operation fits into a cowshed, but if people like our gin, that's all that matters.
"We have a rich abundance of wild food on our doorstep in the Teviot valley, and Lilliard Gin aims to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour palette and our Borders 'terroir'."
John Henderson, of Born in the Borders, said the gin distillery was a natural companion to the Scottish Borders Brewery on the site.
"To be able to play host to the first new distillery in the Borders in nearly 200 years is incredible," he said.
"And the fact that Lilliard Gin are looking to use Borders botanicals means they are completely in tune with our own ethos of local sourcing.
"We just can't wait for them to get started, and to taste their gin."
The gin takes its name from a legendary Borders figure.
"Lilliard was the heroine of the Battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545, fought just north of the distillery," explained Ms Macinnes.
"Lilliard reputedly fought to avenge the death of her lover at the hands of the English. The battle site is also known as Lilliard's Edge.
"We wanted a name that reflected our landscape, and our strong female production team, and Lilliard seemed like a natural choice." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Scottish Borders has given permission for a gin distillery to be built, but the article does not mention any permission or approval being granted.
2. The summary mentions a "gin distillery" being given the go-ahead, but the article only talks about Lilliard Gin, which is a specific brand of gin being produced at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.
3. The summary does not mention the name of the distillery or the location, but the article mentions that Lilliard Gin is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.
4. The summary mentions "a number of proposals" for whisky distilleries, but the article only talks about Lilliard Gin and does not mention any other proposals.
5. The summary does not mention anything about the size of the still or the production scale, but the article mentions that Lilliard Gin's still is one of the smallest production stills in the UK and that their entire operation fits into a cowshed.
6. The summary does not mention the name of the figure that the gin is named after, but the article explains that the gin takes its name from a legendary Borders figure named Lilliard.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the article, such as the location, the name of the distillery, and the size of the still.
