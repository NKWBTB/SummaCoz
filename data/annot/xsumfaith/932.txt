    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    three people have been rescued from a burning car in the vale of glamorgan on saturday afternoon, police have said. 

    Article: 
    It was the fourth time in a week a device - believed to be a World War Two munition - had been found in the city.
Roads around Matilda Street were sealed off at about 10:30 BST and traffic was diverted as police liaised with a military bomb disposal team.
The area was declared safe by South Yorkshire Police about four hours later.
Three devices were uncovered in the same area last Wednesday and a temporary cordon was put in place.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions "three people rescued from a burning car" but the article does not mention anything about a burning car.
2. The article does mention that police were called to an area in the city due to the discovery of a device believed to be a World War Two munition.
3. The article states that the area was declared safe by South Yorkshire Police after a military bomb disposal team was called in.
4. The summary does not mention anything about a device or a bomb disposal team, which suggests that it is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a burning car, which is not present in the article.
