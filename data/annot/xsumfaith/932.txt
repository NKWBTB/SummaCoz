</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article is about a device found in a city, while the summary is about a burning car in the vale of glamorgan. These two locations are not the same, and the summary does not match the content of the article.
2. The article mentions a device believed to be a World War Two munition, while the summary mentions three people rescued from a burning car. These are two completely different scenarios, and there is no connection between them.
3. The article is written in a formal and objective style, while the summary is written in a simple and informative style. This suggests that the summary is not a summary of the article, but rather a separate piece of information.
4. The article does not mention any people being rescued or any burning cars, while the summary mentions three people rescued from a burning car. This is a clear contradiction between the two.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a separate piece of information that has been mistakenly included with the article.
