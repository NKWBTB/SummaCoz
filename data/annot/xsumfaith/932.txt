It was the fourth time in a week a device - believed to be a World War Two munition - had been found in the city.
Roads around Matilda Street were sealed off at about 10:30 BST and traffic was diverted as police liaised with a military bomb disposal team.
The area was declared safe by South Yorkshire Police about four hours later.
Three devices were uncovered in the same area last Wednesday and a temporary cordon was put in place.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "three people have been rescued from a burning car in the vale of glamorgan on saturday afternoon, police have said",
  "three people have been rescued from a burning car in the vale of glamorgan on saturday afternoon"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is about a bomb disposal operation in Sheffield, while the summary is about a burning car in the Vale of Glamorgan. The two locations are not the same, so there is a consistency issue.
2. The second span in the summary, "three people have been rescued from a burning car in the vale of glamorgan on saturday afternoon," is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about a burning car or people being rescued.
3. The first span in the summary, "three people have been rescued from a burning car in the vale of glamorgan on saturday afternoon, police have said," is also not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about the police saying that three people were rescued from a burning car.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and there are two inconsistent spans.
