    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    brighton & hove albion midfielder mark minichiello has signed a new three-year contract with the championship club. 

    Article: 
    Sidwell, 34, has made 32 Championship appearances this season to help the Seagulls achieve promotion to the top flight for the first time in 34 years.
With his contract due to expire at the end of the campaign, the midfielder is now hoping to sign a new deal.
"I want to be a part of it next year because I know we can stay in the Premier League," he said.
Brighton's recent win over Wigan confirmed their promotion, and with a four-point lead over second-placed Newcastle, Chris Hughton's side are now hoping to wrap up the league title in the final two matches.
Sidwell made 19 appearances for Albion on loan from Stoke during 2015-16 before signing a one-year deal with Brighton in June 2016.
He has previously played in the Premier League with Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Fulham and Stoke and believes he deserves the opportunity to play at the top level again.
Sidwell told BBC Radio Sussex: "When I signed the contract last year no-one expected me to play as many games as I have. I've probably given a better impact than expected.
"When I have played I've played well, I've put my best foot forward and I've given myself every opportunity to earn a new deal.
"If there's one on the table then hopefully we can thrash it out, it can be done and we can enjoy the summer." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Mark Minichiello has signed a new three-year contract with the club.

However, the article does not mention Mark Minichiello at all. Instead, it talks about Steve Sidwell, who has made 32 Championship appearances this season and is hoping to sign a new deal with the club.

2. The summary mentions that the midfielder has signed a new three-year contract, but the article states that Sidwell is hoping to sign a new deal, not that he has already signed one.

3. The summary does not provide any information about the length of the contract Sidwell is hoping to sign, whereas the article states that he is hoping to sign a new deal, which implies that the length of the deal is not yet certain.

4. The summary does not mention anything about Sidwell's previous experience in the Premier League, which is mentioned in the article.

5. The summary does not mention Sidwell's comments about wanting to play at the top level again, which are included in the article.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is actually describing Steve Sidwell, not Mark Minichiello, and it does not provide accurate information about the length of the contract or Sidwell's previous experience in the Premier League.
