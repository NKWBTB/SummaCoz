Find out why.

<Article>
Sidwell, 34, has made 32 Championship appearances this season to help the Seagulls achieve promotion to the top flight for the first time in 34 years.
With his contract due to expire at the end of the campaign, the midfielder is now hoping to sign a new deal.
"I want to be a part of it next year because I know we can stay in the Premier League," he said.
Brighton's recent win over Wigan confirmed their promotion, and with a four-point lead over second-placed Newcastle, Chris Hughton's side are now hoping to wrap up the league title in the final two matches.
Sidwell made 19 appearances for Albion on loan from Stoke during 2015-16 before signing a one-year deal with Brighton in June 2016.
He has previously played in the Premier League with Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Fulham and Stoke and believes he deserves the opportunity to play at the top level again.
Sidwell told BBC Radio Sussex: "When I signed the contract last year no-one expected me to play as many games as I have. I've probably given a better impact than expected.
"When I have played I've played well, I've put my best foot forward and I've given myself every opportunity to earn a new deal.
"If there's one on the table then hopefully we can thrash it out, it can be done and we can enjoy the summer."

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder is Steve Sidwell, not Mark Minichiello. The summary incorrectly names the player as Minichiello.
2. The article states that Sidwell has made 32 Championship appearances this season, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it states that he has signed a new three-year contract, which is not mentioned in the article.
3. The article does not mention anything about Sidwell signing a new contract. In fact, it states that he is hoping to sign a new deal, but no agreement has been reached yet.
4. The article mentions that Sidwell has previously played in the Premier League with several clubs, but the summary does not include this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly names the player, leaves out important information about the player's appearances and contract status, and omits details about the player's previous experience in the Premier League.
