Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation.
From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.
This deferral period has been left in place because there is a "window period" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable.
This window period is far less than 12 months.
The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days.
In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.
By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.
Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.
Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. "To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence."
But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: "The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses."
A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.
NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.
The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the complete ban on blood donation by men who have had sex with other men is being lifted, but a one-year deferral period remains in place.
2. The summary states that "gay men were unable to donate."
3. The problem is that the summary implies that the reason why gay men were unable to donate is because of the lifting of the ban, but the article does not support this implication.
4. In fact, the article states that the one-year deferral period is still in place for men who have had sex with other men, regardless of their sexual orientation.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the ban was the reason why gay men were unable to donate, when in fact the one-year deferral period is the reason.

So, the consistency issue is that the summary implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the lifting of the ban and the ability of gay men to donate, when the article does not support this implication.
