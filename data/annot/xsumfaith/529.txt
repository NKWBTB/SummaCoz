    Summary: 
    when i reported last year about the urgent need for blood donors i received many comments from gay men that they would like to donate but were unable to. 

    Article: 
    Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation.
From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.
This deferral period has been left in place because there is a "window period" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable.
This window period is far less than 12 months.
The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days.
In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.
By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.
Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.
Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. "To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence."
But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: "The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses."
A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.
NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.
The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that gay men who had ever had sex with another man were unable to donate blood, but the article states that the ban is being lifted, and men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.

2. The article explains that the deferral period has been left in place because there is a "window period" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable. This window period is far less than 12 months.

3. The article goes on to say that in other countries, such as the US, Canada, and France, there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men, whereas the UK is lifting the ban but imposing a 12-month deferral period.

4. The article quotes Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill as saying that the one-year deferral is too long, while Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust, says that the remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses.

5. The article notes that a one-year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well, such as anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.

6. Based on these points, it is clear that the summary statement "gay men were unable to donate blood" is not consistent with the article, as the ban is being lifted and men who have not had sex with another man in the past 12 months can donate. The summary statement focuses only on the fact that gay men were unable to donate, without mentioning the lifting of the ban or the deferral period. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
