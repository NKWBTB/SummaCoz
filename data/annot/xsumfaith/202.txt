<Article>
The Friesians were found in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday after eating poisonous tree clippings dumped in a farmer's field.
North Wales Police said the culprit is described as a heavily built man, aged 50 to 60, with curly brown hair, driving a dark blue pick-up truck.
Anyone with information can call 101.
"Apparently he has been dumping clippings over past two weeks. Has to be living/working local to Colwyn Bay," Sgt Rob Taylor, of the rural crime team, tweeted on Sunday.
A post-mortem examination showed the cows, aged 16 months, died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings.
Sgt Taylor said he was "appalled" by the "atrocious" act of fly-tipping and praised the "impressive" response to his appeal for information on social media.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "police are appealing for information after a cow was killed in conwy county on saturday",
  "conwy county on saturday"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the cows were found in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday, not on Saturday.
2. The summary mentions "Conwy county on Saturday", which is not accurate as the article does not mention Conwy county or any location on Saturday.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides incorrect information about the location and day when the cows were found.

Here's a breakdown of the consistency issues in the summary:

* "police are appealing for information after a cow was killed in Conwy county on Saturday" - The article does not mention Conwy county or any location on Saturday.
* "Conwy county on Saturday" - The article does not mention Conwy county or any location on Saturday.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
