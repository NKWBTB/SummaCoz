    Summary: 
    police are appealing for information after a cow was killed in conwy county on saturday. 

    Article: 
    The Friesians were found in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday after eating poisonous tree clippings dumped in a farmer's field.
North Wales Police said the culprit is described as a heavily built man, aged 50 to 60, with curly brown hair, driving a dark blue pick-up truck.
Anyone with information can call 101.
"Apparently he has been dumping clippings over past two weeks. Has to be living/working local to Colwyn Bay," Sgt Rob Taylor, of the rural crime team, tweeted on Sunday.
A post-mortem examination showed the cows, aged 16 months, died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings.
Sgt Taylor said he was "appalled" by the "atrocious" act of fly-tipping and praised the "impressive" response to his appeal for information on social media. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions a cow being killed in Conwy County on Saturday, but the article states that the Friesians were found dead in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday.
2. The summary does not mention anything about the cows dying from eating poisonous tree clippings, while the article explains that the cows died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings.
3. The summary does not mention the culprit's description or the dark blue pick-up truck, which are both included in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the post-mortem examination or the response to the appeal for information on social media, which are both mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the key information provided in the article.
