<Article>
The Friesians were found in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday after eating poisonous tree clippings dumped in a farmer's field.
North Wales Police said the culprit is described as a heavily built man, aged 50 to 60, with curly brown hair, driving a dark blue pick-up truck.
Anyone with information can call 101.
"Apparently he has been dumping clippings over past two weeks. Has to be living/working local to Colwyn Bay," Sgt Rob Taylor, of the rural crime team, tweeted on Sunday.
A post-mortem examination showed the cows, aged 16 months, died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings.
Sgt Taylor said he was "appalled" by the "atrocious" act of fly-tipping and praised the "impressive" response to his appeal for information on social media.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the incident occurred on Saturday, but the article states that the incident occurred on Friday.
2. The summary mentions that the cow was killed in Conwy County, but the article states that the incident occurred near Old Colwyn, which is not in Conwy County.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the cause of death, but the article states that the cows died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings.
4. The summary does not mention anything about a post-mortem examination, but the article states that a post-mortem examination was conducted.
5. The summary mentions that the police are appealing for information, but the article states that the police have already received information through social media.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a brief and inaccurate summary of the article.
