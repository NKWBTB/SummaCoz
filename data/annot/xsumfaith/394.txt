Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that David Lipton, the second in command at the IMF, made a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
2. In his speech, Lipton outlined some of the risks facing the global economy, which the IMF has been warning about for some time.
3. The article quotes Lipton as saying that the IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows a weakening baseline, and that the organization is likely to downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
4. However, the summary states that the head of the IMF has warned that the IMF is "latest".

Reasoning:

The summary is not consistent with the article because the word "latest" is not present in the article. The article quotes Lipton as saying that the IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows a weakening baseline, but the word "latest" is not used to describe the IMF. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate reflection of the article's content.
