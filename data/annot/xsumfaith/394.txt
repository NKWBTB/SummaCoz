<Article>
David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that David Lipton, the second in command at the IMF, made a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
2. In his speech, Lipton outlined some risks to the global economy, including weaker-than-expected trade figures from China.
3. The article quotes Lipton as saying, "The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline."
4. The article also states that the IMF is likely to downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
5. Based on these points, it is clear that the article is discussing the current state of the global economy and the risks it faces, rather than the head of the IMF's latest statement.
6. Therefore, the summary statement "the head of the international monetary fund (imf) has warned that the international monetary fund (imf) is ``latest\'\''" is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of the head of the IMF making a recent statement.
7. Similarly, the summary statement "the head of the international monetary fund (imf) has warned that the international monetary fund (imf) is ``latest" is also not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of the head of the IMF making any statement.

Overall, the summary statements are not consistent with the article because they do not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article discusses the current state of the global economy and the risks it faces, rather than the head of the IMF's latest statement.
