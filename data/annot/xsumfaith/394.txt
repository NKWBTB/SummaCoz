<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the head of the international monetary fund (imf) has warned that the international monetary fund (imf) is ``latest\'\'. 

    Article: 
    David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the head of the IMF has warned that the IMF is "latest".
2. However, the article does not mention the head of the IMF or any warning about the IMF being "latest". Instead, it mentions David Lipton, the second in command at the IMF, outlining some risks in a speech.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of the head of the IMF or any warning about the IMF being "latest" in the article.
4. The article does mention the IMF's latest reading of the global economy and its likely downgrade of its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth, but this is not the same as the summary's claim about the head of the IMF warning about the IMF being "latest".

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be inaccurate or misleading.
