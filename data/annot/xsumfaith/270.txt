The views were expressed following a meeting of the EU Negotiation Joint Ministerial Committee in London.
Mr Davis said the UK government would keep Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland up-to-date about negotiations.
However, Mr Russell said transparency about UK government plans was needed.
Mr Davis said he wanted to hold a monthly meeting to share analysis as part of a "two-way information flow" with each of the three nations.
He believed that would allow the devolved administrations to voice their views as the Westminster government prepares talks with Brussels.
Mr Davis said: "Today's meeting was an important step in bringing the devolved administrations together with the UK government to discuss how we can work together to get the best deal for the whole of the UK.
"Naturally, there are different standpoints around the table, but the meeting was constructive and amicable. We will meet regularly and share our latest thinking as the UK shapes its negotiating strategy.
"We will work positively with the Scottish government, the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Executive as we implement the decision of the people of the UK to leave the EU."
Mr Russell said it was "good" that the process of involving the Scottish government was under way.
But he added: "More than four months after the referendum the UK government has still not made its strategic intentions clear.
"There was a discussion over EU market access but we do not know whether UK ministers want to remain inside the single market or the customs union. This will remain a considerable problem as we continue to promote the interests of Scotland.
"The UK Government must provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions."
He said he made it "absolutely clear" that membership of the single market "is essential for the economic prosperity of Scotland".
The UK government hopes the High Court judgment on how Article 50 will be triggered will be overruled on appeal to the Supreme Court next month.
However, the Scottish government will seek to oppose the UK government in the Supreme Court during the appeal.
The intention is for Lord Advocate James Wolffe, Scotland's most senior law officer, to apply to be heard in the case.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Brexit Secretary David Davis met with the UK government for a meeting. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Mr. Davis met with the devolved administrations (Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) to discuss Brexit negotiations.
2. The summary does not provide any information about the content of the meeting, such as what was discussed or any agreements reached. The article provides detailed information about the topics discussed, including EU market access and the single market.
3. The summary does not mention any of the specific points made by Mr. Russell, such as the need for transparency and clarity from the UK government on its intentions for Brexit negotiations. The article quotes Mr. Russell extensively on these issues.
4. The summary does not provide any context for the meeting, such as the fact that it was held in London or that it was part of a regular series of meetings to be held between the UK government and the devolved administrations. The article provides this context.

Overall, the summary does not provide a accurate or informative summary of the article. It is a very brief and incomplete summary that does not capture any of the key points or details of the article.
