    Summary: 
    jersey\'s exit from the english football league has been criticised by uefa, the sport\'s football association has confirmed. 

    Article: 
    Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation.
Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials.
"This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin.
"From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria.
"In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport.
Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations.
But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
"I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin.
"We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly.
"One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Uefa has criticized Jersey's exit from the English Football League. However, the article states that Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid, which implies that Uefa is not rejecting Jersey's application but rather not allowing it to be discussed by the congress.
2. The summary mentions that Jersey's exit has been criticized by Uefa, but the article does not mention any criticism from Uefa. Instead, the article states that Uefa's executive will not allow the congress to discuss Jersey's bid.
3. The summary states that Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in September 2015.
4. The summary mentions that Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations, were accepted into Uefa, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Gibraltar's initial application was made before the rules were changed, and Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
5. The summary states that Jersey FA president Phil Austin said that the executive of Uefa do not have the authority to reject their application, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Austin said that Uefa's executive will not allow the congress to discuss Jersey's bid.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed information about Jersey's bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa, and the reasons why Uefa's executive will not allow the congress to discuss Jersey's bid.
