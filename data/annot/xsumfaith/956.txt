Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation.
Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials.
"This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin.
"From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria.
"In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport.
Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations.
But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
"I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin.
"We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly.
"One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Jersey's exit from the English Football League has been criticized by Uefa.
2. However, the article states that Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid, and that they have rejected the application.
3. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Uefa has criticized Jersey's exit from the English Football League, as they have not had the opportunity to discuss the matter.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Uefa has taken a negative stance on Jersey's exit, when in fact they have simply rejected the application.
5. The article does mention that Jersey FA president Phil Austin believes that the executive of Uefa do not have the authority to reject the application, and that it should be put to a vote at the congress. However, this is not mentioned in the summary.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article, as it does not accurately convey the content of the article and is not consistent with the information presented.
