<Article>
Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation.
Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials.
"This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin.
"From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria.
"In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport.
Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations.
But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
"I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin.
"We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly.
"One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "sport\\'s football association has confirmed",
  "football league"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "sport's football association" - The article does not mention anything about the sport's football association confirming anything. In fact, the article only mentions the Jersey FA president Phil Austin's comments about Uefa's rejection of their application. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not supported by the article.
2. "football league" - The article does not mention anything about a football league. The article only talks about Jersey's bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is also not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes two phrases that are not supported by the information in the article.
