Find out why.

<Article>
Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Anderson has cancelled his contract with Barrow by mutual consent to join a National League rival, but the summary claims that Torquay United have signed him from National League side Torquay United. This is a contradiction, as there is no mention of Torquay United signing Anderson in the article.
2. The article mentions that Anderson has played for several clubs in the past, including Aldershot, Exeter, and Italy, but the summary only mentions that he played for Torquay United. This is not consistent with the information in the article.
3. The article states that Anderson is a centre-back, but the summary does not mention his position. This is a minor inconsistency, but it could be important if the summary is intended to provide a summary of the article's content.
4. The article mentions that Keating, another player who has joined Torquay United, was recommended to the club by a former manager, but the summary does not mention this. This is another inconsistency that could be important if the summary is intended to provide a summary of the article's content.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. It is important to ensure that summaries accurately reflect the content of the original article to maintain the integrity of the information.
