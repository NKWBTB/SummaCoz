<Article>
Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

2. The article mentions that Anderson, a centre-back, has cancelled his contract with Barrow by mutual consent to join a National League rival, but the summary does not mention this fact.
3. The summary states that the transfer is for an undisclosed fee, but the article does not mention any transfer fee.
4. The article mentions that Anderson has previously played for Aldershot and Exeter, but the summary does not mention these clubs.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
