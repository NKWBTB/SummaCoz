    Summary: 
    torquay united have signed defender scott anderson from national league side torquay united for an undisclosed fee. 

    Article: 
    Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Torquay United signed defender Scott Anderson from a National League side, but the article does not mention any transfer of a player named Scott Anderson.
2. The article mentions a player named Myles Keating, who is a striker, but the summary does not mention any transfer of a striker.
3. The article mentions that Myles Keating was recommended to Torquay United by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams, but the summary does not mention any recommendation or connection to Micky Adams.
4. The article states that Myles Keating has previously played for Sligo Rovers, Galway United, and Finn Harps, but the summary does not mention any of these clubs.
5. The article mentions that Ruairi Keating, a 21-year-old striker, has joined Torquay United subject to international clearance, but the summary does not mention any transfer of a player named Ruairi Keating.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a player named Scott Anderson, who is not mentioned in the article, and also fails to mention other important details mentioned in the article, such as Myles Keating's previous clubs and the fact that he was recommended by Micky Adams.
