Find out why.

<Article>
Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

<Summary>
torquay united have signed former port vale striker james keatings on a two-and-a-half-year deal.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the player signed is a centre-back named Anderson, not a striker named Keatings.
2. The summary states that Torquay United signed a striker named James Keatings on a two-and-a-half-year deal.
3. The article does not mention any mention of James Keatings or a two-and-a-half-year deal for a striker.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions a player and contract that do not exist in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it refers to a player (James Keatings) and a contract (two-and-a-half-year deal) that are not mentioned in the article.
