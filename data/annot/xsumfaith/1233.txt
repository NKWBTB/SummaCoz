    Summary: 
    torquay united have signed former port vale striker james keatings on a two-and-a-half-year deal. 

    Article: 
    Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Torquay United have signed former Port Vale striker James Keatings on a two-and-a-half-year deal.

2. However, the article does not mention anything about Torquay United signing a striker named James Keatings. Instead, it mentions the signing of center-back Anderson and striker Ruairi Keating.

3. The article states that Ruairi Keating is a 21-year-old striker who has previously played for Sligo Rovers, Galway United, and Finn Harps.

4. The summary's reference to James Keatings is not supported by the article. The article only mentions Ruairi Keating as the striker who has joined Torquay United.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reference to James Keatings is an error or a misreading of the information provided in the article.
