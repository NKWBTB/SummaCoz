    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has been found guilty of murdering his mother and his mother in a park in dorset. 

    Article: 
    Ken Dickie, 64, died in hospital on 14 May, six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole.
Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother.
He shouted "yes" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court.
The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a "down phase" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May.
In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got "tanked up" on alcohol.
The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public.
Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight.
He and his mother Samantha, 57, also of Apple Close, also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events.
The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr Dickie had pushed Mrs Mitchell and she had pushed him back.
But Mr Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing what he described as a "tragic accident".
The pair will be sentenced on 6 February. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was found guilty of murdering his mother and his mother in a park in Dorset. However, the article states that the man, Ken Dickie, died in hospital on May 14th, six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole. This means that Ken Dickie did not survive the incident, and therefore could not have been found guilty of murdering anyone.

2. The summary also states that the man was found guilty of murdering his mother, but the article does not mention any charges or convictions related to Mrs. Dickie's death. The article only mentions that Jamie Mitchell, the man's son, had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight and that he and his mother, Samantha, had also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a conviction for murder, which is not supported by the information in the article. Additionally, the article does not mention any charges or convictions related to Mrs. Dickie's death, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that the man was found guilty of murdering his mother.
