The former Manchester City man, 30, won 61 caps for England after making his senior debut in 2009.
He was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships but played just three minutes at Euro 2016.
"The decision we've reached is about common sense. I wish Sam [Allardyce], the players, staff and supporters success in the future," Milner said.
Milner also holds the record for the most capped England Under-21 player, picking up 46 caps after making his first appearance in 2004.
He scored his first, and only, international goal in England's 5-0 victory over Moldova at the 2014 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.

[
  "former england midfielder adam milner has announced his retirement from international football"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Adam Milner won 61 caps for England and played in two World Cups and two European Championships.
2. The summary states that Adam Milner has announced his retirement from international football.
3. These two statements are inconsistent, as if Milner had announced his retirement, he would not have played in any of the tournaments mentioned in the article.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not supported by the information in the article, and is considered to be an inconsistency.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains a statement that is not supported by the information provided in the article.
