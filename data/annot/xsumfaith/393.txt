    Summary: 
    former england midfielder adam milner has announced his retirement from international football. 

    Article: 
    The former Manchester City man, 30, won 61 caps for England after making his senior debut in 2009.
He was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships but played just three minutes at Euro 2016.
"The decision we've reached is about common sense. I wish Sam [Allardyce], the players, staff and supporters success in the future," Milner said.
Milner also holds the record for the most capped England Under-21 player, picking up 46 caps after making his first appearance in 2004.
He scored his first, and only, international goal in England's 5-0 victory over Moldova at the 2014 Fifa World Cup qualifiers. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Adam Milner has announced his retirement from international football.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Adam Milner retiring from international football. Instead, it talks about his career with the England national team and his achievements.
3. The article states that Milner won 61 caps for England and was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships.
4. If Milner had retired from international football, it would be mentioned in the article. However, there is no mention of such a decision.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement about Milner retiring from international football is not supported by the text.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains a statement that is not supported by the text. The article does not mention Milner retiring from international football, and therefore the summary is incorrect.
