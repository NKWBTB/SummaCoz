The company says its Dtek50 smartphone offers improved security over rival Android devices, and will cost less than its previous handset Priv.
It is the firm's second Android handset after switching focus away from its struggling BB10 platform.
One analyst said the phone was the "right move" but that the company still faced an "uphill battle" with devices. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions that Google has announced a new Android smartphone, but the article does not mention Google at all. Instead, the article talks about BlackBerry and its Dtek50 smartphone.
2. The summary states that the new smartphone will be available at the end of the year, but the article does not mention a release date.
3. The summary mentions that the phone will cost less than BlackBerry's previous handset, the Priv, but the article does not provide any information about the price of the Dtek50.
4. The summary says that the Dtek50 offers improved security over rival Android devices, but the article does not mention anything about security. Instead, it focuses on the fact that the Dtek50 is BlackBerry's second Android handset and that the company is trying to compete with other devices.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions Google, a release date, and pricing, all of which are not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary talks about improved security, which is not a focus of the article.
