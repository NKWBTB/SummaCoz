</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "google has announced a new android android smartphone, which it says will be at the end of the year"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the company is releasing a new Android smartphone, but the summary incorrectly states that Google (not the company) has announced a new Android smartphone. Consistency issue.
2. The article states that the phone will be available at the end of the year, but the summary incorrectly states that the phone will be at the end of the year. Consistency issue.
3. The article mentions that the company is switching focus away from its BB10 platform, but the summary does not mention this. Consistency issue.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
