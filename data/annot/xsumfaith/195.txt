</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the company is launching a new Android smartphone, but the summary claims that Google (the company is not mentioned in the summary) is announcing a new Android smartphone.
2. The article states that the phone will be available at the end of the year, but the summary does not mention any release date.
3. The article mentions that the company is switching focus away from its BB10 platform, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. Specifically, it:

* Misidentifies the company (BlackBerry, not Google)
* Fails to mention the release date
* Omits the fact that the company is switching focus away from BB10.
