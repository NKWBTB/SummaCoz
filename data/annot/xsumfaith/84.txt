    Summary: 
    a gin distillery has opened its doors to the public in the scottish borders. 

    Article: 
    Lilliard Gin is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.
It comes ahead of a number proposals, which are at various stages of the planning process, to open the region's first whisky distillery since 1837.
Lead distiller Kate Macinnes said the potential to make the Scottish Borders a "region of distilling excellence" was "really exciting".
"Our gin production is on a completely different scale to the other distilleries in development," she said.
"Our still is one of the smallest production stills in the UK, and our entire operation fits into a cowshed, but if people like our gin, that's all that matters.
"We have a rich abundance of wild food on our doorstep in the Teviot valley, and Lilliard Gin aims to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour palette and our Borders 'terroir'."
John Henderson, of Born in the Borders, said the gin distillery was a natural companion to the Scottish Borders Brewery on the site.
"To be able to play host to the first new distillery in the Borders in nearly 200 years is incredible," he said.
"And the fact that Lilliard Gin are looking to use Borders botanicals means they are completely in tune with our own ethos of local sourcing.
"We just can't wait for them to get started, and to taste their gin."
The gin takes its name from a legendary Borders figure.
"Lilliard was the heroine of the Battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545, fought just north of the distillery," explained Ms Macinnes.
"Lilliard reputedly fought to avenge the death of her lover at the hands of the English. The battle site is also known as Lilliard's Edge.
"We wanted a name that reflected our landscape, and our strong female production team, and Lilliard seemed like a natural choice." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that the distillery is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh, but the summary does not include this information.

2. The article states that the distillery is the first whisky distillery to open in the region since 1837, but the summary does not mention whisky or the fact that it is the first distillery to open in the region in nearly 200 years.

3. The article highlights the use of local botanicals and the desire to capture the flavor palette of the Teviot valley, but the summary does not mention this.

4. The article introduces Lilliard Gin as a new distillery, but the summary refers to it as "a gin distillery" without specifying that it is a new distillery.

5. The article mentions that the distillery is small, with one of the smallest production stills in the UK, and that it fits into a cowshed, but the summary does not include this information.

6. The article highlights the significance of the name Lilliard, which is derived from a legendary Borders figure, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, as it omits several key details and includes some inaccuracies.
