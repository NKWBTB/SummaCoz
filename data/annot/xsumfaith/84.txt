<Article>
Lilliard Gin is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.
It comes ahead of a number proposals, which are at various stages of the planning process, to open the region's first whisky distillery since 1837.
Lead distiller Kate Macinnes said the potential to make the Scottish Borders a "region of distilling excellence" was "really exciting".
"Our gin production is on a completely different scale to the other distilleries in development," she said.
"Our still is one of the smallest production stills in the UK, and our entire operation fits into a cowshed, but if people like our gin, that's all that matters.
"We have a rich abundance of wild food on our doorstep in the Teviot valley, and Lilliard Gin aims to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour palette and our Borders 'terroir'."
John Henderson, of Born in the Borders, said the gin distillery was a natural companion to the Scottish Borders Brewery on the site.
"To be able to play host to the first new distillery in the Borders in nearly 200 years is incredible," he said.
"And the fact that Lilliard Gin are looking to use Borders botanicals means they are completely in tune with our own ethos of local sourcing.
"We just can't wait for them to get started, and to taste their gin."
The gin takes its name from a legendary Borders figure.
"Lilliard was the heroine of the Battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545, fought just north of the distillery," explained Ms Macinnes.
"Lilliard reputedly fought to avenge the death of her lover at the hands of the English. The battle site is also known as Lilliard's Edge.
"We wanted a name that reflected our landscape, and our strong female production team, and Lilliard seemed like a natural choice."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a gin distillery has opened its doors to the public in the Scottish Borders, which is not consistent with the article. The article states that the distillery is still in the planning stages and has not yet opened.
2. The summary does not provide any information about the distillery's production process, the use of local botanicals, or the name of the distillery, all of which are mentioned in the article.
3. The summary does not mention the legendary Borders figure after whom the distillery is named, which is mentioned in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the location of the distillery, which is mentioned in the article as being based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and does not provide accurate information about the gin distillery in the Scottish Borders.
