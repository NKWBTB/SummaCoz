Step 1: Identify the key points in the summary and article.

Summary:

Article:

* The theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.

Step 2: Identify the inconsistencies between the summary and article.

Inconsistency 1: The summary states that the theatre has been closed for more than 50 years, but the article does not mention any specific time frame for when the theatre was last in use.

Inconsistency 2: The summary mentions only the theatre reopening, but the article includes information about the BBC studios and the larger east wing restoration project.

Step 3: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies.

Reason 1: The summary may have focused solely on the theatre reopening, neglecting to mention the other aspects of the east wing restoration project.

Reason 2: The time frame for the theatre's closure may not have been accurately represented in the summary.

Conclusion: The provided summary is not consistent with the article because it only focuses on the theatre reopening and does not mention the other aspects of the east wing restoration project, and it inaccurately states that the theatre has been closed for more than 50 years.
