</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the theatre will reopen its doors for the first time in more than 50 years. However, the article states that the theatre has been unused for decades, not more than 50 years. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary does not provide any information about the theatre's history or the reason for its closure. The article, on the other hand, mentions that the theatre was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays, and all kinds of entertainment, and that it has languished unused for decades. This suggests that the summary does not accurately represent the theatre's background or its current state.
3. The summary does not mention the BBC studios, which are also part of the east wing restoration project. The article mentions that the BBC studios will be repaired and refurbished, but the summary does not include this information.
4. The summary does not provide any information about the funding for the restoration project. The article mentions that the Heritage Lottery Fund is contributing £18.8m towards the project, while Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m. The summary does not include this information, which is an important aspect of the project.
5. Finally, the summary does not accurately represent the theatre's intended use. According to the article, the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music. The summary simply states that the theatre will reopen its doors, without providing any information about its intended use.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the theatre's history, current state, or intended use. It also omits important information about the funding for the restoration project and the BBC studios, which are also part of the east wing restoration project.
