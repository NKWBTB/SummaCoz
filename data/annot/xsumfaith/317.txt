It is hoped the theatre, founded in 1875, will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy and live music.
The BBC studios, at the eastern end of the Palace, will also be repaired and refurbished.
If successful in raising funds it is hoped the theatre will reopen in 2018.
The theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.
As part of the renovations, the glazed east court will become a space for the public and for exhibitions.
Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) is contributing £18.8m towards the project, while Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m.
The entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of £26.6m.
Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust have committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017.
The theatre, which has languished unused for decades, still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place.
It was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays and all kinds of entertainment, even hosting early cinema screenings.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the theatre has been unused for decades, but it does not mention how long it has been unused. The summary states that the theatre has been closed for "more than 50 years," which is not supported by the article.
2. The article mentions that the theatre was created to showcase various forms of entertainment, including opera, musicals, plays, and early cinema screenings. However, the summary only mentions "theatre," which is not consistent with the information in the article.
3. The article states that the theatre and studios are part of a larger restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination. The summary does not mention this project or the scope of the restoration work.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important information. Specifically, the summary:

* Includes information that is not supported by the article (the claim that the theatre has been closed for "more than 50 years").
* Fails to mention important details from the article (the scope of the restoration project and the variety of entertainment forms the theatre was created to showcase).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
