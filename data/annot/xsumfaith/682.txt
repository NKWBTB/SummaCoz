</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "with a car on the a3 in hampshire",
  "a cyclist has died after being in a crash with a car on the a3 in hampshire",
  "cyclist"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the crash involved "several vehicles" but the summary only mentions a car. Inconsistency.
2. The article does not mention the word "cyclist" or "bicycle" anywhere, but the summary specifically mentions "a cyclist." Inconsistency.
3. The article states that the crash happened on the southbound carriageway near the Hindhead tunnel, but the summary does not mention the location of the crash. Inconsistency.
4. The article states that the 32-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene, but the summary does not mention the fatality. Inconsistency.
5. The article states that the road was closed between Thursley and Liphook while officers investigated the scene, but the summary does not mention the road closure. Inconsistency.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies listed above, the summary is not consistent with the article.
