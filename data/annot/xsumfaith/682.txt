</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the crash involved several vehicles, but the summary only mentions a car. The article does not mention a cyclist.
2. The article states that the man was pronounced dead at the scene, but the summary does not mention the man's death.
3. The article states that a 33-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention, but the summary does not mention any arrests.
4. The article states that the road was closed for several hours, but the summary does not mention any road closures.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions a cyclist, does not mention the man's death, does not mention any arrests, and does not mention any road closures. These omissions indicate that the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
