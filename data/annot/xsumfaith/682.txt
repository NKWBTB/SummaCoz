    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the cyclist died after being in a crash with a car on the A3 in Hampshire.

2. The article does not mention a crash between a cyclist and a car. Instead, it reports a multi-vehicle crash involving several vehicles.

3. The summary implies that the cyclist died as a result of the crash, but the article only states that a 32-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene, without specifying how he died.

4. The article does mention that a 33-year-old man from Waterlooville was arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention, but this is not mentioned in the summary.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the cyclist died in a crash with a car, when in fact the article only reports a multi-vehicle crash and does not specify how the man died. Additionally, the summary does not mention the arrest of the 33-year-old man.
