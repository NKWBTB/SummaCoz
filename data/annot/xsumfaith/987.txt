Find out why.

<Article>
The charge follows the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1.
City had forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho sent off, but Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action.
City manager Pep Guardiola apologised for his team's part in the incident.
Aguero, 28, received a four-match ban for what was his second dismissal for violent conduct this season, following a high and late challenge on Chelsea defender David Luiz.
Fernandinho clashed with Fabregas in the scuffle that followed Aguero's challenge, and the Brazil midfielder will serve a three-match ban.
Both clubs have until 18:00 GMT on 8 December to respond to the charge.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "manchester city manager jose mourinho has been charged by the football association for failing to reach the fa cup"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola apologized for his team's part in the incident, but there is no mention of Jose Mourinho being the manager of Manchester City.
2. The article does not mention anything about Manchester City failing to reach the FA Cup. In fact, the article states that the team won the game against Chelsea 3-1.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Jose Mourinho, who is not the manager of Manchester City, and it also mentions failing to reach the FA Cup, which is not a valid reason for a charge according to the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the spans that are highlighted as having consistency issues are correct.
