    Summary:

    Article: 
    The 39-year-old, from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, revealed the news live on BBC One's The One Show on Thursday evening but has yet to reveal the name.
It is Miss Jones' first child with partner Charlie Thomson and he was born in the morning of Sunday, 22 January, weighing 7lbs 11.
Ms Jones was concerned she had left it too late to have a baby after filming a documentary, Fertility and Me. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Leanne Jones has a baby boy, but the article does not mention the gender of the baby. The article only mentions that the baby was born on Sunday, January 22, and weighed 7lbs 11.
2. The summary states that Leanne Jones has a partner named Charlie Thomson, but the article does not mention a partner. Instead, it mentions that Leanne was concerned she had left it too late to have a baby after filming a documentary, Fertility and Me.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as the gender of the baby and the existence of a partner.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is because it includes additional information that is not supported by the article.
