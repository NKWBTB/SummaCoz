<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Leanne Jones has given birth to a baby boy, but the summary only mentions a baby without specifying the gender.
2. The article states that Leanne Jones is the mother of the baby, but the summary does not mention the mother's name.
3. The article provides the name of the partner, Charlie Thomson, but the summary does not mention him.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information as the article. Specifically, the summary does not mention the gender of the baby, the name of the mother, or the name of the partner.
