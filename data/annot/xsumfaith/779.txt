    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    luke potts, the star of the beast in the beast, is to star in the new film adaptation of the beast. 

    Article: 
    The star will play Mrs Potts, the housekeeper magically transformed into a teapot whom Dame Angela Lansbury voiced in the 1991 animated version of the film.
Fellow Oscar-winner Kevin Kline has also signed on to play Maurice, the father of the 'Beauty' character Belle.
The film will be released in US cinemas on 17 March 2017.
It was announced in January that Harry Potter star Emma Watson had been cast as Belle.
It was subsequently confirmed that Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens will play the Beast and that Luke Evans will co-star as the villainous Gaston.
Josh Gad, who voiced Olaf the snowman in Disney's animated hit Frozen, is also on board as Gaston's sidekick LeFou.
Bill Condon, director of Dreamgirls and the last two Twilight films, will direct the movie, which begins filming at Shepperton Studios in May. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Luke Potts is starring in the new film adaptation of "The Beast," but the article does not mention Luke Potts at all.
2. The article mentions Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as the Beast, and Luke Evans as Gaston, but there is no mention of a character named Luke Potts.
3. The summary also mentions Kevin Kline as Maurice, but the article only mentions that he has signed on to play Maurice, without providing any details about his character.
4. The article provides a release date for the film (March 17, 2017) and mentions that filming will begin in May at Shepperton Studios.
5. Based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes a character (Luke Potts) who does not exist in the article, and it also leaves out important details about the characters mentioned in the article (such as their roles in the film).

Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
