Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "Luke Potts, the star of the Beast in the Beast, is to star in the new film adaptation of the Beast."
2. However, the article does not mention anyone named Luke Potts. Instead, it mentions Luke Evans, who will co-star as the villainous Gaston.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a character named Luke Potts in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that there is no character named Luke Potts in the article. The article mentions Luke Evans, but not Luke Potts.
