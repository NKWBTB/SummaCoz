Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Emma Watson will play the role of Belle, while the summary states that "luke potts" will star in the film. This is inconsistent, as there is no character named "luke potts" in the article or in the original fairy tale.
2. The article also mentions that Dan Stevens will play the role of the Beast, but the summary makes no mention of this. This is another inconsistency, as the summary implies that "luke potts" will be playing the Beast, which is not supported by the article.
3. The article further mentions that Josh Gad will play the role of LeFou, but the summary makes no mention of this character or any other characters besides "luke potts." This is another inconsistency, as the summary only mentions one character (luke potts) while the article mentions multiple characters.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the cast of the film, omits important details, and is missing information that is provided in the article.
