    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a teenage boy has become the first in the world to be given a place in the welsh open final. 

    Article: 
    Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme.
GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character".
Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform.
"If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a teenage boy has become the first in the world to be given a place in the Welsh Open final. However, the article does not mention anything about the Welsh Open final.
2. The article only mentions that 14 successful candidates, including the teenager, will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of the Welsh Open final in the article. The article only mentions the Austrian Open.
4. The summary may have been incorrect or misleading, as it implies that the teenager has achieved something unique and special, but the article does not support this claim.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim that is not supported by the information in the article.
