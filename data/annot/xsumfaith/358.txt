<Article>
Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme.
GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character".
Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform.
"If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Luke, a 14-year-old boy, is one of 14 successful candidates in the Fighting Chance scheme.
2. The article does not mention anything about Luke participating in the Welsh Open or becoming the first person in the world to be given a place in the Welsh Open final.
3. The summary states that a teenage boy has become the first in the world to be given a place in the Welsh Open final. This statement is not supported by the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not present in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it includes information that is not supported by the article. The article does not mention Luke participating in the Welsh Open or becoming the first person in the world to be given a place in the Welsh Open final.
