<Article>
Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme.
GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character".
Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform.
"If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme." This means that Luke is one of the 14 selected candidates, but the summary states that he is the first to be given a place in the Welsh Open final, which is not supported by the article.
2. The article does not mention anything about the Welsh Open or Luke participating in the final. Instead, it focuses on the Fighting Chance scheme and the training regime that the selected candidates will undergo.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim that is not supported by the information provided in the article. The article does not mention Luke participating in the Welsh Open final, and therefore the summary is not accurate.

Therefore, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it makes a claim that is not supported by the information provided in the article.
