The 50 year-old said she was "lucky to be here" after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online.
O'Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched "women's heart attack symptoms", which included sudden nausea and aches, before taking a few aspirin.
She visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked.
O'Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became nauseous and feverish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Nyack village home, near New York.
In the blog entry on her website, a poem entitled "my heart attack", O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the "widow maker".
The star, who has acted in several films and TV shows including Drop Dead Diva, Will and Grace and Nip/Tuck, also said she did not call the emergency services.
However, she issued a warning to her readers: "Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911."
She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gameshow was cancelled in March due to low ratings.

<Summary>
actress and actress rosie o \'donnell has had a heart attack after she was diagnosed with a heart attack.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Rosie O'Donnell has had a heart attack.
2. However, the article does not mention that O'Donnell has had a heart attack. Instead, it states that she was diagnosed with a heart attack and received treatment.
3. The article specifically states that O'Donnell searched "women's heart attack symptoms" online and visited a cardiologist the next day, which suggests that she was diagnosed with a heart attack rather than having already experienced one.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it states that O'Donnell has had a heart attack, while the article only mentions that she was diagnosed with one.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and needs to be revised to reflect the information in the article more accurately.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Rosie O'Donnell has had a heart attack after she was diagnosed with a heart attack.
2. However, the article states that she visited a cardiologist the next day after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online. Thus, she had a heart attack before the diagnose.
3. The summary misuses a repetitive phrase "actress and actress".
