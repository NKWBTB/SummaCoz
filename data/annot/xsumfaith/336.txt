Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Lupita Nyong'o will be working with Ryan Coogler on the film Black Panther, but the summary claims that she has signed a two-year deal with a national league side. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Lupita Nyong'o signing a deal with a sports team.
2. The article mentions that Lupita Nyong'o played the character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the article provides information about Lupita Nyong'o's previous work in the Star Wars franchise.
3. The summary uses the phrase "star wars actor", which is not consistent with the article, as the article does not refer to Lupita Nyong'o as a Star Wars actor. The article mentions that she played a role in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but does not use the phrase "star wars actor".
4. The summary uses the phrase "has signed a two-year deal", which is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Lupita Nyong'o signing a deal with a sports team.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, including the fact that it mentions a two-year deal with a sports team, does not mention Lupita Nyong'o's previous work in Star Wars, and uses the phrase "star wars actor" inconsistently.
