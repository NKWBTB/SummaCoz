    He told The Hollywood Reporter he was "super excited" and wanted "to put a different spin on it", but did not expand on what role he would play.
The film will see Jordan reunite with his Creed director Ryan Coogler.
"I'm looking forward to working with Ryan once again. It's gonna be a good time," he said.
He added he could not wait to work with Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014, as well as Chadwick Boseman - who is currently on the big screen playing Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War.
Jordan played the Human Torch in last year's Fantastic Four flop reboot.  Nyong'o also played CGI character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Black Panther will be released in February 2018. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions that Lupita Nyong'o has signed a two-year deal with a national league side, but the article does not mention anything about her signing a deal with a sports team.
2. The article only mentions that Lupita Nyong'o will be working with Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler on the upcoming Black Panther movie, but the summary does not mention anything about the movie.
3. The summary implies that Lupita Nyong'o will be playing a role in the National League, but the article does not mention anything about her playing a role in the National League or any other sports team.
4. The article mentions that Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o have worked together before, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is misleading and contains inaccurate information about Lupita Nyong'o's involvement in the National League and her work with Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler.
