1. The summary states that Lupita Nyong'o, a Star Wars actor, has signed a two-year deal with a national league side.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Lupita Nyong'o signing a deal with a national league side. Instead, it mentions that she won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014 and played the CGI character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
3. The article also mentions that Nyong'o will be working with Michael B. Jordan in the upcoming film Black Panther, but there is no mention of her signing a deal with a national league side.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no information in the article about Lupita Nyong'o signing a two-year deal with a national league side.
