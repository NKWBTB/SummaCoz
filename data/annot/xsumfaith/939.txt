</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "protest against a planned airport airport in the republic of ireland",
  "republic of ireland"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the protest took place at an airport in London, specifically on the northern runway at 03:30 BST on Monday.
2. The summary states that the protest was against a planned airport in the republic of Ireland. This is inconsistent with the article, as there is no mention of Ireland or any planned airport expansion in the article.
3. The phrase "republic of Ireland" is also inconsistent with the article, as the article does not mention Ireland at all.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
