    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "men and women have been charged in connection with a protest against a planned airport airport in the republic of ireland."
2. However, the article states that the protest was against the expansion plans of an existing airport, not a planned airport.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to a planned airport, which is not mentioned in the article.
4. Additionally, the article mentions that the protest took place on the northern runway of the existing airport, but the summary does not mention this detail.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to a planned airport that does not exist and omits important details about the location of the protest.
