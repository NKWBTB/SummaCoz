</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the protest took place at Heathrow Airport in the UK, not in the Republic of Ireland.
2. The summary mentions a planned airport in the Republic of Ireland, which is not mentioned in the article.
3. The article states that the protesters were charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome, while the summary only mentions a protest against a planned airport.
4. The article is specific about the location of the protest (Heathrow Airport) and the charges brought against the protesters, while the summary is vague and does not provide any specific details.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary is incorrect in stating that the protest took place in the Republic of Ireland and does not mention the specific charges brought against the protesters.
