    batsman michael smith has been named australia\'s captain for the final two matches of the ashes in august. 

    Article: 
    Smith, 26, already leads the one-day side and will also captain the Twenty20 team in the absence of the injured Aaron Finch.
Fellow batsman David Warner, 28, has been named as Smith's vice-captain.
"At 26, Steve is a fine young man with extraordinary talent," said national selector Rod Marsh.
"He is highly regarded by the selectors and we congratulate him on being appointed to the role on an ongoing basis. He should be incredibly proud."
Clarke, 34, confirmed his decision to retire after his side surrendered the Ashes with a heavy defeat by England at Trent Bridge, which gave the hosts a 3-1 lead.
Smith had already captained the side in three Tests against India last summer, when Clarke was recovering from hamstring surgery and back issues.

"When Michael made his decision to retire last week it was a very straightforward decision for us to nominate Steve as his successor," added Marsh.
"He has big shoes to fill but everything about him suggests he is the right man for the job."
Warner has earned the vice-captain's role despite a history of disciplinary problems, and Marsh said of the opener: "David has matured and developed into an important senior figure in the Australian team. He has come a long way.
"We believe that he will respond well to the added responsibility of leadership."
Smith and Warner will lead Australia in the limited-overs matches that follow the final Ashes Test at the Oval, which starts on 20 August. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Michael Smith will captain Australia for the final two matches of the Ashes in August, but the article does not mention the Ashes.

The article only mentions that Smith will captain the side in the absence of Aaron Finch, who is injured, and that he has already captained the side in three Tests against India last summer.

Step 2: The summary states that David Warner has been named as Smith's vice-captain, but the article does not mention anything about Warner being named as vice-captain.

The article only mentions that Warner has been selected for the side and that he has matured and developed into an important senior figure in the Australian team.

Step 3: The summary states that Clarke confirmed his decision to retire after his side surrendered the Ashes, but the article does not mention anything about Clarke retiring.

The article only mentions that Clarke is retiring, but it does not provide any information about the circumstances surrounding his retirement.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, such as the Ashes and Clarke's retirement. Additionally, the summary omits information that is present in the article, such as Warner's selection and Smith's previous experience as captain.
