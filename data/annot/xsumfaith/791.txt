In 2008, about 40 were recorded on the seahorse study site at South Beach in the bay, but none have been spotted there since 2013.
Miranda Krestovnikoff has been investigating for Inside Out and speaking to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, and the Royal Yachting Association's Emma Barton. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a new study has been discovered at a nature reserve in Norfolk, but the article does not mention any new study.
2. The article does mention a seahorse study site at South Beach in the bay, but the last recorded sighting of seahorses there was in 2013.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no new study mentioned in the article, and the last recorded sighting of seahorses at the study site was in 2013, not in 2016 as implied in the summary.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it falsely claims the existence of a new study, when in fact there is no such study mentioned in the article.
