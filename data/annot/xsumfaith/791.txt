</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "a new study has been discovered at a nature reserve in norfolk, where a new study has been found"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "none have been spotted there since 2013" in reference to seahorses at South Beach in the bay. This indicates that there have been no sightings of seahorses at this location for at least three years.
2. The summary, on the other hand, states that "a new study has been discovered at a nature reserve in Norfolk." This suggests that the study was found at a different location than South Beach.
3. The article does not mention any study being conducted at a nature reserve in Norfolk. In fact, the article only mentions Norfolk in the context of the seahorse sightings at South Beach.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that a new study has been discovered at a nature reserve in Norfolk is not supported by the article.

Overall, the consistency issue in the summary is that it mentions a new study being found at a nature reserve in Norfolk, but the article does not provide any information about such a study.
