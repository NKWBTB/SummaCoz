    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Novak Djokovic lost to Japan's Gustavo in the second round of the Rogers Cup in Montreal, but the article does not mention anything about Djokovic playing in Montreal or losing to a Japanese player.
2. The article states that Djokovic lost to Brazilians Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares in Rio, which is a different tournament from the Rogers Cup in Montreal.
3. The summary mentions that Djokovic died, but the article does not mention anything about his death.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains incorrect information about Djokovic's loss and death, which are not supported by the article.
