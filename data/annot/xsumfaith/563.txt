    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Forest Green Rovers goalkeeper Sam Russell has signed a new one-year deal.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a new contract for Sam Russell. Instead, it mentions the signings of defenders Lee Collins and Callum Evans and midfielder Reece Brown.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a new contract for Sam Russell, which is not mentioned in the article.

The reason for this inconsistency is likely that the summary was written based on incomplete or inaccurate information, or that the information was misinterpreted or misunderstood. It is important to carefully read and review the information before writing a summary to ensure that it is accurate and consistent with the original source.
