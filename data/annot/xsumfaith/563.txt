Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the club is called "New Lawn" and not "forest green rovers." Therefore, the summary's reference to "forest green rovers" is inconsistent with the article.
2. The article mentions that the club won promotion to League Two last season, but the summary does not mention anything about the club's promotion or its current league status. This is inconsistent because the article provides important context about the club's recent achievements, but the summary does not include this information.
3. The article mentions that the club has signed new players, including defenders Lee Collins and Callum Evans and midfielder Reece Brown, but the summary does not mention anything about new signings. This is inconsistent because the article provides information about the club's recent activities, but the summary does not include this information.
4. The article mentions that the club's goalkeeper is Sam Russell, but the summary does not mention the goalkeeper's name or any information about the goalkeeper. This is inconsistent because the article provides specific information about the club's goalkeeper, but the summary does not include this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include important information about the club's name, promotion status, new signings, and goalkeeper.
