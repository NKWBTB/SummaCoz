    Summary: 
    supermarket giant teca has agreed to sell its yuca & easy & easy & easy & easy & easy & easy & easy & easy & easy & 

    Article: 
    The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time.
Around 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees are to transfer to the new business as part of the deal.
Tesco said in a statement that this is an "orderly and efficient exit from the US market".
Under the terms of the deal, Tesco will loan the new business around Â£80m.
Fresh & Easy, which operates 200 stores across California, Nevada and Arizona, has lost money since opening in 2007.
Tesco did not specify which stores are being transferred to Yucaipa, but it is understood the remaining 50 shops will be closed.
It will cost Tesco Â£150m to dispose of the Fresh & Easy brand, but part of that is a loan which may be paid back.
Also, if Yucaipa is sucessful and the business becomes profitable, Tesco has the option to buy a stake.
Yucaipa is a Los Angeles based private equity company focused on supermaket and restaurant businesses and is run by billionaire investor Ron Burkle.
In April of this year, Tesco reported its first fall in annual profits for 20 years. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Tesco has agreed to sell its "yuca & easy" business, but the article does not mention any such business. The article only mentions "Fresh & Easy", which is a loss-making US food chain that Tesco is looking to dispose of. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary states that Tesco will loan the new business around £80m, but the article does not mention any such loan. The article only states that Tesco will dispose of Fresh & Easy for £150m, and that it has the option to buy a stake in the new business if it becomes profitable.
3. The summary states that 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees will transfer to the new business, but the article does not mention any such transfer. The article only states that around 50 stores will be closed, without mentioning the number of employees.
4. The summary states that the new business will be run by Yucaipa, a Los Angeles-based private equity company, but the article does not mention any such company. The article only mentions that Tesco is disposing of Fresh & Easy and that it has the option to buy a stake in the new business if it becomes profitable.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
