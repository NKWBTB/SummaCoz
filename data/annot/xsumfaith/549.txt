It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury.
However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected.
Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later.
He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side.
There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby.
Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy.

[
  "club saracens against newcastle on sunday",
  "number eight billy",
  "2017"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "club saracens against newcastle on sunday" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about Billy Vunipola playing for Saracens against Newcastle. In fact, the article only mentions that Vunipola has been out of action since November with a knee injury, and there is no mention of him playing for Saracens or any other team.
2. "number eight billy" - This statement is also not consistent with the article because the article does not refer to Billy Vunipola as a "number eight." The article only refers to him as a "capped 32 times by England" and an "outstanding performer" without specifying his position.
3. "2017" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention the year 2017. The article only mentions that Vunipola could be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March or Ireland a week later, which suggests that the article is referring to the upcoming Six Nations tournament, not the 2017 season.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
