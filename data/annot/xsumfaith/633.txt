The body of the man in his 70s, was found at the house in Nettleden Road, Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, on Saturday afternoon.
A man in his 80s was also taken to hospital, a police spokeswoman said.
Detectives want to question 55-year-old Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, and have warned people not to approach him.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: "The investigation is still in its early stages.
"However, we are continuing to treat the death as murder. We urgently want to speak to Ian McLoughlin in connection with this offence."
He is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall, with straight, greying, collar-length hair and of average build.
He is believed to have been wearing sunglasses, blue jeans or three-quarter length trousers and a dark blue, light blue and white checked short-sleeved shirt with a button-down collar.
Anyone with information has been urged to contact police or Crimestoppers.
Officers have been conducting additional patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "dead",
  "hertfordshire",
  "in hertfordshire"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "dead": The article does not mention the word "dead" at all. The body of the man was found, but it does not specify whether he is dead or not. Therefore, the summary should not have included this word.
2. "hertfordshire": The article does mention that the body was found in Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, which is in Hertfordshire. However, the summary should have been more specific and mentioned "Berkhamsted" instead of just "hertfordshire".
3. "in hertfordshire": The article does not mention anything about the body being "in Hertfordshire". The summary should have been more accurate and not included this phrase.

Therefore, the summary should have read:

"Police are seeking a man over the murder of an elderly man found at a house in Berkhamsted."

This summary is more accurate and consistent with the information provided in the article.
