    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that police are seeking a man over the murder of an elderly man found dead at a house in Hertfordshire. However, the article does not mention anything about the police seeking a specific person or any details about the suspect.
2. The summary mentions that the body of the man in his 70s was found at a house in Nettleden Road, Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, on Saturday afternoon. However, the article does not mention the location of the house or the day the body was found.
3. The summary states that a man in his 80s was also taken to hospital. However, the article does not mention anything about another person being taken to the hospital.
4. The summary quotes Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brunning as saying "the investigation is still in its early stages" and "we are continuing to treat the death as murder." However, these quotes are not present in the article.
5. The summary describes the suspect as white, about 6ft tall, with straight, greying, collar-length hair and of average build. The article does not provide any description of the suspect.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary includes details that are not present in the article, such as the location of the house, the day the body was found, and the description of the suspect. Additionally, the quotes from Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brunning are not present in the article.
