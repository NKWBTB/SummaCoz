    Summary: 
    patrick ah van scored two tries on his return from a five-match ban to help widnes to victory at castleford. 

    Article: 
    Tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van and Chris Bridge gave Widnes a 14-6 half-time lead, with Cas loanee Paddy Flynn responding against his parent club.
Flynn scored another early in the second, but Ah Van, Lloyd White (2) and Joe Mellor tries made it 38-12.
Despite three Cas tries in four minutes - Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn's hat-trick score - Widnes held on.
The Vikings' victory had looked assured when Mellor took advantage of Castleford indecision on a short kick-off, running straight through to help them to a 26-point lead.
But, having lost nine of their previous 10 matches, their defence creaked as they let Patrick, who has just signed a three-year deal to move from Huddersfield after his loan spell, in for a try.
Gale and Flynn - on loan at Castleford from the Vikings until the end of the season - made it a nervy finish, but the Tigers suffered their fourth consecutive home league defeat.
Widnes moved above Wakefield into seventh, while Castleford remain in sixth, one point above the Vikings.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Patrick Ah Van scored two tries on his return from a five-match ban, but the article does not mention any such ban.

2. The article mentions that Ah Van scored a try, but it does not specify that it was his return from a ban.

3. The summary states that Patrick Ah Van helped Widnes to victory at Castleford, but the article does not mention any such victory. Instead, it states that Widnes held on to their lead despite a late surge from Castleford.

4. The summary does not mention the other tries scored by Widnes players, such as Macgraff Leuluai, Chris Bridge, Lloyd White, and Joe Mellor, which are mentioned in the article.

5. The summary does not mention the fact that Castleford's defence creaked and they let Widnes score several tries, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the events described in the article.
