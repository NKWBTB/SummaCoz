Weatherhogg, formerly of Guthrie, near Forfar, was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with the man between 10 September, 2013 and 17 September the following year.
He was also convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on 25 December, 2014.
The woman told the trial she had felt "blackmailed" by Weatherhogg.
Lady Wolffe told the Weatherhogg that she had to pass a sentence on him that "reflected society's abhorrence" at such conduct.

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the man was jailed for eight years for attempting to blackmail a woman and engaging in sexual activity with her boyfriend. However, the article does not mention blackmail. Instead, it states that the man coerced the woman to engage in sexual activity with him and with another man that he found through an adult website.
2. The summary mentions that the man sent a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day. However, the article does not mention this detail.
3. The summary states that the man was placed on the sex offenders register. While this is mentioned in the article, it is not the main focus of the article.
4. The summary does not mention the woman's feelings of being "blackmailed" by the man, which is mentioned in the article.
5. The summary mentions that the judge said the man posed a "moderate risk" of sexual re-offending. However, this is not mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the given summary is not a consistent summary of the article. It omits several important details and includes some inaccuracies.
