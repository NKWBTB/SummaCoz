He had denied the charges but was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff George Way remitted the case to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because its greater sentencing powers.
Weatherhogg, formerly of Guthrie, near Forfar, was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with the man between 10 September, 2013 and 17 September the following year.
He was also convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on 25 December, 2014.
The woman told the trial she had felt "blackmailed" by Weatherhogg.
Lady Wolffe told the Weatherhogg that she had to pass a sentence on him that "reflected society's abhorrence" at such conduct.
The judge said that Weatherhogg, a first offender, had been assessed as posing "a moderate risk" of sexual re-offending.
Defence counsel Jonathan Crowe said it had been "a dramatic shock" for Weatherhogg to be placed on remand ahead of sentencing.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man was convicted of attempting to blackmail a woman and engaging in sexual activity with her boyfriend.
2. However, the article states that the man, Clive Weatherhogg, was convicted of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity with a man he found through an adult website, and intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.
3. The article does not mention anything about the man attempting to blackmail the woman.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits the fact that the man was convicted of coercing the woman and instead focuses only on the blackmail aspect.
5. Additionally, the summary's mention of the man's sexual activity with the woman's boyfriend is not supported by the article, which only mentions the man's own sexual activity with the woman.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content and is therefore not consistent with the article.
