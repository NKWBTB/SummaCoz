    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the number of transgender and minority characters in the us has increased by more than a third in the year, according to a new report. 

    Article: 
    The advocacy group Glaad analysed shows seen or to be shown between June 2016 and May 2017 and counted 278 regular and recurring LGBT characters.
The number of transgender characters has risen from seven to 16 this year.
But Glaad bemoaned the fact that more than 25 lesbian and bisexual female characters died or were killed off.
They include the characters Poussey Washington and Bea Smith, who met violent ends in Orange is the New Black and Wentworth respectively.
The report also found a record high percentage of black characters on broadcast television, thanks mostly to shows like Empire, Luke Cage and How to Get Away with Murder.
Glaad's Where We Are on TV study based its findings on scripted broadcast, cable and streaming series already being shown or for which casting had been confirmed.
Glaad's president Sarah Kate Ellis said it was "heartening to see progress being made" but said numbers were "only part of the story".

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the number of transgender and minority characters in the US has increased by more than a third, but the article does not mention any specific increase in the number of transgender characters. Instead, the article states that the number of transgender characters has risen from seven to 16 this year.
2. The summary mentions that more than 25 lesbian and bisexual female characters died or were killed off, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the report found a record high percentage of black characters on broadcast television.
3. The summary mentions that the report is based on scripted broadcast, cable, and streaming series already being shown or for which casting had been confirmed, but the article does not mention this detail.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.

###Corrected:
