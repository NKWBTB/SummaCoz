     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Manchester City has agreed a deal to sign goalkeeper Carlos Tevez from Shanghai SIPG, but the article does not mention anything about Manchester City or a goalkeeper.
2. The summary mentions a salary of over £310,000 a week, but the article does not provide any information about Tevez's salary.
3. The summary states that Tevez played for seven years in the Premier League and won the title with both Manchester clubs, but the article only mentions that Tevez played for Boca Juniors and Shanghai SIPG, without any mention of the Premier League.
4. The summary mentions that Chelsea agreed terms with Shanghai SIPG for Brazil midfielder Oscar, but the article does not mention anything about Chelsea or Oscar.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
