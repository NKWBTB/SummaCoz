</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that UKIP won the May election, while the summary claims that the Conservatives retained control of the Green Party. This is inconsistent, as the article does not mention the Conservatives winning the Green Party or any control over it.
2. The article provides campaign spending figures for the four main parties, but the summary makes no mention of these figures or any financial information related to the Green Party. This is inconsistent, as the article highlights the significant difference in campaign spending between the parties.
3. The article states that the six highest-spending parties spent a total of £9,347,087 on campaigning, but the summary does not mention this figure or any information about the total campaign spending. This is inconsistent, as the article provides specific figures for each party's campaign spending.
4. The article mentions that all but Labour spent more than they did during the 2009 European election campaign, but the summary makes no mention of this fact. This is inconsistent, as the article provides information about the change in campaign spending between the two elections.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and should not be relied upon as an accurate representation of the information provided in the article.
