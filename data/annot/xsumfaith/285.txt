    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the motorcyclist died after a collision with a tractor in Lincolnshire.

2. The article states that the motorcyclist was killed in a collision with a tractor in Lincolnshire, but it does not mention the motorcyclist's death. Instead, it states that the motorcyclist lived locally and that the tractor driver was not injured.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the motorcyclist died, while the article does not confirm this.

4. The article only mentions that the motorcyclist lived locally and that the force has appealed for witnesses to the collision to come forward. It does not provide any information about the motorcyclist's death.

5. So, the summary is not accurate and is not supported by the information in the article.
