Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The first sentence of the summary states that a woman has been arrested, but the article does not mention any arrests.
2. The article states that the suspect, a 38-year-old man, has handed himself in to authorities, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article mentions that the victim is a 28-year-old woman who was found lying on a pavement with serious injuries, but the summary does not mention the victim's gender or age.
4. The article states that the victim and the suspect are both German citizens of Kurdish origin, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article mentions that the motive for the attack is not yet clear, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the information provided in the article. The summary incorrectly states that a woman has been arrested, fails to mention the suspect's self-surrender, and does not include important details about the victim and the motive for the attack.
