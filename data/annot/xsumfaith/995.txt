Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "woman's body": The article states that the victim was a 28-year-old woman, but the summary incorrectly refers to her as "woman's body". This is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately describe the victim as a person.
2. "hannover, county down": The article states that the incident occurred in Hamelin, Lower Saxony, but the summary incorrectly refers to the location as "hannover, county down". This is not consistent with the article, as "Hamelin" and "Hannover" are not the same place.
3. "county down": The article does not mention the word "county" or "Down" at all, so this is not consistent with the article.
4. "woman has been arrested": The article states that the suspect, a 38-year-old man, was taken into custody, but the summary incorrectly states that a woman has been arrested. This is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately describe the person who was taken into custody.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies with respect to the article.
