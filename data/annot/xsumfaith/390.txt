    Summary: 
    a woman who was treated for leukaemia after being diagnosed with leukaemia has said she is ``lucky to be alive\'\'. 

    Article: 
    Erin Cross, from Chester, received gene editing therapy in the USA after a Â£100,000 appeal raised the cash.
Doctors have told her parents she is now in remission after the therapy which took place in August.
Her mother Sarah Cross said: "It means she is now able to have a bone marrow transplant in Manchester."
She added: "I'm so glad I pushed for her to get on the trial here at Seattle, if I hadn't she wouldn't be here today."
Erin was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia using CAR (Chimaeric Antigen Receptor) T-Cell therapy which re-engineers the cells in the lab to attack and kill cancer cells when injected back into the patient's body.
"We got a call from the hospital who told us the cancer cells have gone - we couldn't believe it as she has never come back clear from any treatment before," said Ms Cross.
"She is running round now like any six year old," she added.
Erin is due to return to the UK within the next month for a transplant at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where a donor has already been found. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman is "lucky to be alive" after being treated for leukaemia. However, the article does not mention anything about the woman being "lucky" or her current health status being a miracle.
2. The summary mentions that the woman was treated for leukaemia, but the article does not mention leukaemia as one of the conditions the woman was treated for. Instead, the article states that the woman received gene editing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the woman being in remission or having a bone marrow transplant, which are both mentioned in the article.
4. The summary does not provide any specific information about the woman's treatment or her current health status, other than the fact that she is "lucky to be alive". The article, on the other hand, provides detailed information about the woman's treatment and her current health status.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
