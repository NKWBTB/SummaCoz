<Article>
Erin Cross, from Chester, received gene editing therapy in the USA after a Â£100,000 appeal raised the cash.
Doctors have told her parents she is now in remission after the therapy which took place in August.
Her mother Sarah Cross said: "It means she is now able to have a bone marrow transplant in Manchester."
She added: "I'm so glad I pushed for her to get on the trial here at Seattle, if I hadn't she wouldn't be here today."
Erin was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia using CAR (Chimaeric Antigen Receptor) T-Cell therapy which re-engineers the cells in the lab to attack and kill cancer cells when injected back into the patient's body.
"We got a call from the hospital who told us the cancer cells have gone - we couldn't believe it as she has never come back clear from any treatment before," said Ms Cross.
"She is running round now like any six year old," she added.
Erin is due to return to the UK within the next month for a transplant at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where a donor has already been found.

[
  "``lucky to be alive\\'\\'",

  "said"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "``lucky to be alive\'\'" - The quotation marks in the summary are not consistent with the article. In the article, the quote is written as "I'm so glad I pushed for her to get on the trial here at Seattle, if I hadn't she wouldn't be here today." The quotation marks in the summary are not accurate and do not match the quote in the article.
2. "lucky to be alive" - The phrase "lucky to be alive" is not in the article. The article states that Erin is "in remission" after receiving gene editing therapy, but it does not mention anything about being "lucky to be alive."
3. "said" - The summary states that Erin "said" she is "lucky to be alive," but the article does not quote Erin as saying this. The article quotes her mother, Sarah Cross, as saying "I'm so glad I pushed for her to get on the trial here at Seattle, if I hadn't she wouldn't be here today."

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate quotation marks, omits important information, and attributes a quote to the wrong person.
