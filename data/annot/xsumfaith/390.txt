<Article>
Erin Cross, from Chester, received gene editing therapy in the USA after a Â£100,000 appeal raised the cash.
Doctors have told her parents she is now in remission after the therapy which took place in August.
Her mother Sarah Cross said: "It means she is now able to have a bone marrow transplant in Manchester."
She added: "I'm so glad I pushed for her to get on the trial here at Seattle, if I hadn't she wouldn't be here today."
Erin was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia using CAR (Chimaeric Antigen Receptor) T-Cell therapy which re-engineers the cells in the lab to attack and kill cancer cells when injected back into the patient's body.
"We got a call from the hospital who told us the cancer cells have gone - we couldn't believe it as she has never come back clear from any treatment before," said Ms Cross.
"She is running round now like any six year old," she added.
Erin is due to return to the UK within the next month for a transplant at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where a donor has already been found.

<Summary>
a woman who was treated for leukaemia after being diagnosed with leukaemia has said she is ``lucky to be alive\'\'.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the woman was treated for leukaemia and is "lucky to be alive."
2. However, the article states that the woman is in remission after receiving gene editing therapy, and doctors have told her parents that she is now cancer-free.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the woman being in remission or cancer-free, which is a significant inconsistency with the article.
4. The article also mentions that the woman received CAR T-Cell therapy, which is a specific type of gene editing therapy, but the summary does not mention this detail.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the woman's current health status or the treatment she received.
