</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "British number four Aljaz Bedene was also knocked at the quarter-final stage of the Chennai Open in India on Friday." This means that Bedene was eliminated from the tournament.
2. The summary states that "British number two Kyle Edmund was knocked out of the Australian Open in the second round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto." This is incorrect, as there is no mention of the Australian Open or the Rogers Cup in the article.
3. The article does mention that Edmund was eliminated from the tournament, but it does not mention the Australian Open or the Rogers Cup. Instead, it states that Edmund was knocked out of the Chennai Open in India.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it incorrectly states that Edmund was eliminated from the Australian Open when in fact he was eliminated from the Chennai Open.

Overall, the summary is not accurate because it provides information that is not supported by the article.
