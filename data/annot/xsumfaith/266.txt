    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that Kyle Edmund, the British number two, lost to Stan Wawrinka in the second round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto.
    2. The summary states that Kyle Edmund was knocked out of the Australian Open, which is not correct as the article states that he was knocked out of the Rogers Cup.
    3. The article states that Edmund lost in three sets, 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 6-4, whereas the summary states that he was knocked out in the second round, which is not consistent with the article.
    4. The article also mentions that Wawrinka broke serve at 3-2 in the second set and twice in the decider to win the match, which is not mentioned in the summary.
    5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reason for this is that the summary is referring to the wrong tournament (the Australian Open instead of the Rogers Cup) and does not accurately describe the outcome of the match.
