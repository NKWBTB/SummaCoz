Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Dean Cooper rejoined New Lawn side in July 2016 and was ever-present as they won promotion to League Two last season. This means that Dean Cooper is a defender, not a striker.
2. The summary states that Dean Cooper has joined national league side Gateshead on loan until the end of the season. This is inconsistent with the article, which states that Dean Cooper is currently playing for New Lawn side.
3. The article also mentions that Mark Cooper has signed defenders Lee Collins and Callum Evans and midfielder Reece Brown, but there is no mention of Dean Cooper being signed by Gateshead.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Dean Cooper has joined Gateshead on loan until the end of the season is not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary contains inconsistent information about Dean Cooper's current club and position, which is not supported by the article.
