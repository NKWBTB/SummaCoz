    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Dean Cooper has joined Gateshead on loan until the end of the season.
2. However, the article states that Cooper rejoined the New Lawn side in July 2016 and was ever-present as they won promotion to League Two last season. This implies that Cooper is already a member of the club and has not joined Gateshead on loan.
3. Furthermore, the article mentions that Cooper has signed defenders Lee Collins and Callum Evans and midfielder Reece Brown, which suggests that he is still a member of the club and has not left to join Gateshead.
4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Cooper has joined Gateshead on loan when in fact he is already a member of the club.
