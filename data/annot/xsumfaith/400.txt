Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Global AgeWatch Index 2014 measures the social and economic welfare of those over 60 in 96 countries.
2. The article does not mention anything about the number of people living in the UK or any other country.
3. The summary states that the number of people living in the UK has risen dramatically in the past year.
4. This statement is not supported by the article, as the article does not provide any information about the UK or any changes in population.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the article does not provide any information about the UK or any changes in population, while the summary states that the number of people living in the UK has risen dramatically in the past year.
