     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary talks about the number of people living in the UK, while the article is about the Global AgeWatch Index 2014, which measures the social and economic welfare of people over 60 in 96 countries, and does not mention the UK at all.
2. The summary states that the number of people living in the UK has risen dramatically in the past year, but the article does not provide any information about the UK's population.
3. The article only mentions Norway and Afghanistan as the best and worst countries for older people, respectively, and does not mention the UK at all.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it talks about the UK, which is not mentioned in the article, and it also mentions a rise in the UK's population, which is not supported by the article.
