    Summary: 
    hungary\'s president michel szijjarto has warned that hungary could refrain from making attempts to withdraw three laws for asylum seekers. 

    Article: 
    He told Reuters that the EU should not interfere with "domestic issues".
He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights.
The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law.
Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros.
Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months.
Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: "No. Why should we?
"These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues."
The minister added that "my Polish colleague" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary.
EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously.
Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports.
Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law.
Hungary's Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest-based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines.
Meanwhile, draft legislation on NGOs is expected to go before parliament soon.
Human rights groups say it would stigmatise them as "foreign-backed" organisations.
Last month, the deputy head of the bloc's executive Commission, Frans Timmermans, warned action would be taken in coming weeks if there were no positive developments.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Based on the article, the summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The summary states that Hungary's president warned that Hungary could refrain from making attempts to withdraw three laws for asylum seekers, but the article states that the EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and that the country is under pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws.
2. The summary does not mention the EU's objections to Hungary's education law, which could lead to the closure of the Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros.
3. The summary does not mention the EU's pressure on Hungary to withdraw the three laws, or the threat of sanctions if Hungary does not comply.
4. The summary does not mention the human rights groups' criticism of Hungary's draft legislation on NGOs, which they say would stigmatize them as "foreign-backed" organizations.

Therefore, the summary does not provide an accurate representation of the article's content, and is not consistent with the article.
