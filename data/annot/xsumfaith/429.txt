A statement issued by the force said: "Northamptonshire Police has made a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to ensure transparency in examining police action and responses before and during the search for India Chipchase.
"We await the decision of the IPCC and will not be commenting further as the criminal investigation is now in the court process."
On Thursday Mr Tenniswood appeared at Northampton Crown Court via video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.
When asked if he could hear, Mr Tenniswood told the clerk of the court: "I can hear you, definitely."
After that he spoke only to confirm he could see the Judge Rupert Mayo, prosecutor Mary Loram and his lawyer Derek Johashen.
There was no application for bail and he was remanded in custody.
Ms Chipchase was last seen by friends on Bridge Street at about 01:15 GMT on Saturday.
Her disappearance was reported later that day after she failed to turn up to work at The Collingtree pub and restaurant.
Her body was found at the defendant's terraced house in Stanley Road. A post-mortem examination concluded she died as a result of pressure to the neck.
There will be a plea hearing on the 25 May, and a trial date was set for 18 July, to last for 10 days.

  "nightclub",
  NaN

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the body of India Chipchase was found in a terraced house in Stanley Road, but the summary says "nightclub". This is not consistent, as there is no mention of a nightclub in the article.
2. The article does not mention a man appearing in court, but the summary says "a man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a woman". This is also not consistent, as there is no mention of a man appearing in court in the article.
3. The article states that the defendant's name is Edward Tenniswood, but the summary does not mention this. This is also not consistent, as the article provides the name of the defendant but the summary does not include it.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article and omits information that is present in the article.
