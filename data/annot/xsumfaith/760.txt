    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the reasons step by step:

1. The summary mentions "Christmas weather," but the article does not mention Christmas at all. The article is about testing news knowledge with a quiz, and the questions are about events that happened in July 2016, not about Christmas.
2. The summary is written in a way that suggests the reader might be asked questions about their memories of Christmas, but the article does not ask any questions about Christmas. Instead, it provides a quiz with questions about news events from July 2016.
3. The phrase "how much do you remember" is not relevant to the content of the article, which is about testing news knowledge, not about remembering personal experiences or events.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the reader will be asked questions about Christmas, when in fact the article is about testing news knowledge with a quiz about events that happened in July 2016.
