</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "huddersfield giants have signed warrington wolves winger gene ormsby on a one-month loan deal"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the player, Gene Ormsby, plays for Warrington Wolves.
2. The summary states that Gene Ormsby has signed for Huddersfield Giants on a one-month loan deal.
3. The article does not mention anything about Gene Ormsby signing for Huddersfield Giants or any loan deal.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not supported by the information in the article.

The consistency issue is that the summary mentions a loan deal and a different team (Huddersfield Giants) than what is stated in the article (Warrington Wolves).
