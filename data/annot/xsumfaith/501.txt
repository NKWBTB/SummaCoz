    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Huddersfield Giants have signed Warrington Wolves winger Gene Ormsby on a one-month loan deal.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a loan deal. Instead, it states that Ormsby could make his debut for Super League's bottom side in Friday's trip to Hull FC.
3. This suggests that Ormsby has joined Huddersfield Giants permanently, not on a loan deal as stated in the summary.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Ormsby is joining Huddersfield Giants on a temporary basis, while the article suggests that he has joined the team permanently.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Ormsby is joining Huddersfield Giants on a loan deal, when in fact he has joined the team permanently.
