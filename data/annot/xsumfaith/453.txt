<Article>
On Saturday afternoon, members of the public have been invited to take part in planting thousands of new trees at Brackfield Wood in the Faughan Valley.
The project has been organised by the Woodland Trust, and is one of four new woods being created across the UK.
Its aim is to plant "millions" of native UK trees to commemorate the millions of people who died during WW1.
The four-year project is one of the trust's most ambitious planting programmes and uses the pledge: "We will stand for those who fell."
In Brackfield Wood, the conservation charity plans to plant 40,000 trees in tribute to the estimated 40,000 people from the island of Ireland who lost their lives in the conflict.
The trust said it was inviting local people and visitors to the Faughan Valley to "get involved and to make a mark on history through the simple act of tree planting".
Its director, Patrick Cregg, said: "This is a special opportunity to make a personal and hands-on contribution to Brackfield Wood, still very much in its infancy.  We do hope that as many people as possible will join us, roll their sleeves up, and plant a tree.
"By the end of the project, our aim is to have 40,000 native trees planted here at Brackfield, with carpets of wildflowers including iconic poppies.  It will be a place where wildlife will thrive and where people can walk, relax and reflect."
The charity is providing the saplings for members of the public to plant, and has advised volunteers to wear welly boots or "stout footwear".
Brackfield Wood is about seven miles outside Derry city, just off the Glenshane Road and limited parking is available for those taking part in the project.
"The trees, which will stand for generations to come, will be a living, growing tribute to the people from Ireland who played a part in the war: the soldiers, their families and loved ones," Mr Cregg said.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "thousands of people have taken part in a protest in londonderry" - This statement is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of a protest in the article. The article only mentions a tree planting event.
2. "to help save the lives of thousands of native oak trees" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about saving the lives of trees. The article only mentions planting trees as a tribute to the people who died in WW1.
3. "oak" - This word is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention the specific type of tree being planted. The article only mentions "native UK trees" in general.
4. "protest" - This word is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about a protest. The article only mentions a tree planting event.
5. "oak " - This word is not consistent with the article because there is no space between "oak" and the next word "". It should be "oak trees" instead.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article only mentions a tree planting event, but the summary describes a protest to save the lives of trees, which is not supported by the article.
