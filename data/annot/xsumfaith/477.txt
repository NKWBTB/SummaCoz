    Summary: 
    a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of a man was found in a house. 

    Article: 
    The body of the man in his 70s, was found at the house in Nettleden Road, Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, on Saturday afternoon.
A man in his 80s was also taken to hospital, a police spokeswoman said.
Detectives want to question 55-year-old Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, and have warned people not to approach him.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: "The investigation is still in its early stages.
"However, we are continuing to treat the death as murder. We urgently want to speak to Ian McLoughlin in connection with this offence."
He is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall, with straight, greying, collar-length hair and of average build.
He is believed to have been wearing sunglasses, blue jeans or three-quarter length trousers and a dark blue, light blue and white checked short-sleeved shirt with a button-down collar.
Anyone with information has been urged to contact police or Crimestoppers.
Officers have been conducting additional patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but the article does not mention any arrest.

2. The summary mentions the body of a man being found in a house, but the article does not mention a body being found. Instead, it states that the body of a man in his 70s was found outside of the house.

3. The summary mentions that the police want to question a 55-year-old man named Ian McLoughlin, but the article does not mention this name or any specific suspect.

4. The summary mentions that the investigation is still in its early stages, but the article states that the death is being treated as murder and the police are urgently seeking to speak to Ian McLoughlin in connection with the offence.

5. The summary does not mention any information about the suspect's appearance or clothing, but the article provides a detailed description of the suspect's appearance and clothing.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and was likely written based on incomplete or inaccurate information.
