The body of the man in his 70s, was found at the house in Nettleden Road, Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, on Saturday afternoon.
A man in his 80s was also taken to hospital, a police spokeswoman said.
Detectives want to question 55-year-old Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, and have warned people not to approach him.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: "The investigation is still in its early stages.
"However, we are continuing to treat the death as murder. We urgently want to speak to Ian McLoughlin in connection with this offence."
He is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall, with straight, greying, collar-length hair and of average build.
He is believed to have been wearing sunglasses, blue jeans or three-quarter length trousers and a dark blue, light blue and white checked short-sleeved shirt with a button-down collar.
Anyone with information has been urged to contact police or Crimestoppers.
Officers have been conducting additional patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but the article does not mention any arrests.
2. The article states that detectives want to question 55-year-old Ian John McLoughlin, but the summary does not mention any desire to question him.
3. The article describes the victim as being in his 70s, but the summary does not provide any information about the victim's age.
4. The article mentions that the investigation is still in its early stages, but the summary does not provide any information about the stage of the investigation.
5. The article urges people not to approach Ian McLoughlin, but the summary does not mention any warning about approaching him.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the investigation, the victim, or the suspect. The summary only mentions the most basic information, such as the fact that a body was found and a man is wanted for questioning, but it does not provide any additional details that are present in the article.
