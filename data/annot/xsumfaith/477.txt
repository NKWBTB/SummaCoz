The body of the man in his 70s, was found at the house in Nettleden Road, Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, on Saturday afternoon.
A man in his 80s was also taken to hospital, a police spokeswoman said.
Detectives want to question 55-year-old Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, and have warned people not to approach him.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: "The investigation is still in its early stages.
"However, we are continuing to treat the death as murder. We urgently want to speak to Ian McLoughlin in connection with this offence."
He is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall, with straight, greying, collar-length hair and of average build.
He is believed to have been wearing sunglasses, blue jeans or three-quarter length trousers and a dark blue, light blue and white checked short-sleeved shirt with a button-down collar.
Anyone with information has been urged to contact police or Crimestoppers.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the body of a man was found in a house, but the summary only mentions that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. This is inconsistent because the summary does not mention the body being found.
2. The article explains that the investigation is still in its early stages and that the police are treating the death as murder, but the summary does not mention any of this information.
3. The article provides a physical description of the suspect, including his height, hair color, and clothing, but the summary does not include any of this information.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article. It only mentions the arrest of a suspect, but does not provide any details about the body being found or the ongoing investigation. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
