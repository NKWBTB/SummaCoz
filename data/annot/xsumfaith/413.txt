</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the testimonial game will be streamed globally, but the summary claims that Wayne Rooney will make his first appearance in the United States. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Rooney traveling to the United States or playing there.
2. The article states that the game will be played at Old Trafford, which is in Manchester, England. There is no mention of the game being played in the United States.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the charities that Rooney will be supporting, which is mentioned in the article as a key aspect of the testimonial game.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the location of the game and omits important details about the charities that Rooney will be supporting.
