    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Wayne Rooney will make his first appearance in the United States next month. However, the article does not mention anything about Rooney making an appearance in the United States.
2. The summary implies that the testimonial game will be played at Old Trafford, which is Rooney's only professional club. However, the article states that the game will be streamed globally and does not mention a specific location.
3. The summary mentions that the game will be Rooney's first home appearance for Jose Mourinho's three summer signings, but the article does not mention anything about the game being Rooney's first home appearance.
4. The summary states that the game will be available to 1.7 billion people on the platform worldwide, but the article does not mention anything about the game being available on a platform or the number of people it will be available to.
5. The summary mentions that proceeds from the game will be distributed to Rooney's four chosen charities, but the article does not mention anything about the proceeds being distributed to charities.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
