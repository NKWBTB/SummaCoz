  "manchester united\\'s wayne rooney will make his first appearance in the united states next month",
  "first appearance in the united states next month"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Rooney's testimonial game will be streamed globally, but the summary mentions that Rooney will make his first appearance in the United States next month. This is inconsistent because the article does not mention anything about Rooney traveling to the United States or playing a game there.
2. The article does not mention anything about Rooney making his first appearance in the United States. It only mentions that the game will be streamed globally, which suggests that the game will be played at Old Trafford in Manchester, England.
3. The phrase "first appearance in the United States" is not supported by the article. Rooney has played for Manchester United for 12 years, and the article does not mention any previous trips to the United States.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Rooney making his first appearance in the United States, which is not supported by the text.
