    Summary: 
    a fire at a waste processing plant in greater manchester has been suspended after a fire broke out at the site. 

    Article: 
    Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays.
The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.
The firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said.
Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.
Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."
The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.
"The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said.
An EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.
"Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste."
The cause of the fire remains undetermined. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the fire at the waste processing plant in Greater Manchester has been suspended, but the article states that the Environment Agency (EA) has revoked the environmental permit for the site, which means that the company will no longer be able to operate from that site after August 7th. This is not consistent.

2. The summary mentions that the fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport, and the environment, but the article does not mention any concerns raised by the fire service.

3. The summary states that the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators, but the article states that the EA has revoked the environmental permit for the site. This is not consistent.

4. The summary does not mention the cause of the fire, but the article states that the cause remains undetermined.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. It appears that the summary may have been written based on incomplete or inaccurate information.
