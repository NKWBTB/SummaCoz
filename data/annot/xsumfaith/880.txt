Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays.
The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.
The firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said.
Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.
Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."
The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.
"The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said.
An EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.
"Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste."
The cause of the fire remains undetermined.

<Summary>
a fire at a waste processing plant in greater manchester has been suspended after a fire broke out at the site.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the waste processing plant in Greater Manchester has been "suspended" after a fire broke out at the site.
2. However, the article states that the Environment Agency (EA) has revoked the environmental permit for the site, which means that the company is no longer able to operate from that site.
3. The article does not mention anything about the site being suspended, only that the EA has taken enforcement action against the site operators and that the permit has been revoked.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the actions taken by the EA.
5. The summary implies that the site has been temporarily suspended, while the article states that the permit has been permanently revoked.
6. The summary also does not provide any information about the cause of the fire, which is mentioned in the article as undetermined.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate reflection of the article and contains some inaccuracies and omissions.
