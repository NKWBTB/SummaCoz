Find out why.

<Article>
Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays.
The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.
The firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said.
Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.
Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."
The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.
"The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said.
An EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.
"Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste."
The cause of the fire remains undetermined.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "waste processing plant" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention a waste processing plant. Instead, it refers to a "site" or "premises" that was operated by Asset and Land Group.

2. The article does not mention any suspension of the site's operations, nor does it mention a fire breaking out at the site. The article only mentions that the Environment Agency (EA) has revoked the environmental permit for the site, and that the company is still required to remove all the waste.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information about the site and its operations. Specifically, the summary refers to a waste processing plant, which is not mentioned in the article, and it implies that the site's operations have been suspended, which is not accurate.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and it contains inconsistencies that could potentially be misleading to readers.
