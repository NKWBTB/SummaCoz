    Summary: 
    plans to build a new generation of royal navy frigates on the isle of wight have been submitted to the government. 

    Article: 
    The decommissioned Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour.
Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships.
The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted.
Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March.
A final decision is not expected until the spring.
The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.
Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard.
She added: "For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life.
"My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction.
"We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism."
The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will "consider all options" for the frigates to ensure "best financial return for the taxpayer".
A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to "commercial sensitivity".
Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems.
They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.
Last year, the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was sold as scrap for Â£3m. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that plans to build a new generation of royal navy frigates on the Isle of Wight have been submitted to the government, but the article does not mention anything about building new frigates or the Isle of Wight.
2. The summary mentions the ships being moored in Portsmouth Harbour, but the article states that the ships are currently moored in Devonport.
3. The summary states that bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships, but the article states that the bidders are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March.
4. The summary mentions that the government's Disposal Services Authority wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary quotes Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, as saying that she is keen to see at least one of the ships saved from the scrapyard and that a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism, but the article does not include these quotes.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not mentioned in the article, such as building new frigates on the Isle of Wight, and leaves out other important details, such as the fact that the ships are currently moored in Devonport and that the government wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler.
