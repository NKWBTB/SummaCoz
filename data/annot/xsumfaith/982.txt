    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a woman is in a critical condition in hospital after she was hit by a bin lorry in east lothian. 

    Article: 
    The incident happened on Morningside Road, near to Jordan Lane, at about 11:45 on Sunday.
A local diversion was put in place at Comiston Road and Churchill Place, following the incident.
Police Scotland have appealed to anyone who may have seen the elderly woman, or the bin lorry, before the incident occurred.
Sgt Andrew Miller, of the road policing unit, said: "The woman was walking with a wheeled walking aid, similar to a zimmer frame, and we're hopeful anyone who might have seen her will come forward with relevant information." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman was in a critical condition in the hospital, but the article does not mention the woman's current condition. The article only states that she was injured and that police are appealing for witnesses.
2. The summary mentions that the incident occurred in East Lothian, but the article does not specify the location of the incident. The article only mentions that it happened on Morningside Road, near Jordan Lane.
3. The summary mentions that the woman was hit by a bin lorry, but the article does not mention the type of vehicle involved. The article only mentions that the incident happened and that police are appealing for witnesses.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides additional information that is not present in the article, such as the woman's condition and the location of the incident. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate summary of the article.
