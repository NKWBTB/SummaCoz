</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "east lothian",
  "in a critical condition in hospital after she was hit by a bin lorry in east lothian",
  "critical condition in hospital",
  "a woman is in a critical condition in hospital after she was hit by a bin lorry in east lothian"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident happened on Morningside Road, near to Jordan Lane, at about 11:45 on Sunday. However, the summary mentions "east lothian", which is not mentioned in the article.
2. The article does not mention the woman being in a critical condition in hospital. Instead, it states that Police Scotland have appealed to anyone who may have seen the elderly woman, or the bin lorry, before the incident occurred.
3. The summary mentions "critical condition in hospital" twice, which is not supported by the article.
4. The article only mentions the woman being hit by a bin lorry, but the summary adds "a woman is in a critical condition in hospital after she was hit by a bin lorry in east lothian".

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and it exaggerates the condition of the woman.
