    Summary: 
    one of india\'s most iconic artists, singapore item, has been stolen from a temple in the indian capital, delhi. 

    Article: 
    The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) bought the artwork for $650,000 (Â£420,000) from New York dealer Art of the Past in 2007.
The company's manager later admitted selling stolen Indian antiquities, including the bronze being returned.
The allegations first came to light during a 2012 court case against the firm for trafficking antiquities.
The sculpture of Hindu goddess Uma Parameshvari is thought to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu in southern India.
The decision to return the item came after discussions between Singapore's National Heritage Board and the Indian government body looking after its antiquities, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
The ASI submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May, according to the museum.
"While there is no conclusive proof that the sculpture was stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, India, ACM took note of the confession of Aaron Freedman, who was the manager of Art of the Past, of dealing in looted Indian antiquities and of criminal possession of 150 stolen objects," the museum said in a statement.
It was one of 30 objects ACM bought from the art dealer, although none of the others are thought to be listed as stolen. The ASI was reportedly allowed to view them, anyway.
The museum said it will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Singapore item was stolen from a temple in Delhi, but the article does not support this claim. The article states that the sculpture was bought by the Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) from a New York dealer in 2007, and there is no mention of it being stolen from a temple in Delhi.
2. The summary also mentions that the sculpture is of Hindu goddess Uma Parameshvari, but the article does not provide this information. The article only mentions that the sculpture is a bronze of a Hindu deity.
3. The summary states that the Indian government body, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the ACM decided to return the sculpture after discussions with the Indian government body.
4. The summary implies that the sculpture was stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, India, but the article does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The article only mentions that the sculpture was bought from a dealer in New York, and there is no mention of it being stolen.
5. The summary states that the ACM will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the ACM decided to return the sculpture after discovering that it was likely stolen.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides a different account of the events and does not support the claims made in the summary.
