<Article>
The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) bought the artwork for $650,000 (Â£420,000) from New York dealer Art of the Past in 2007.
The company's manager later admitted selling stolen Indian antiquities, including the bronze being returned.
The allegations first came to light during a 2012 court case against the firm for trafficking antiquities.
The sculpture of Hindu goddess Uma Parameshvari is thought to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu in southern India.
The decision to return the item came after discussions between Singapore's National Heritage Board and the Indian government body looking after its antiquities, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
The ASI submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May, according to the museum.
"While there is no conclusive proof that the sculpture was stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, India, ACM took note of the confession of Aaron Freedman, who was the manager of Art of the Past, of dealing in looted Indian antiquities and of criminal possession of 150 stolen objects," the museum said in a statement.
It was one of 30 objects ACM bought from the art dealer, although none of the others are thought to be listed as stolen. The ASI was reportedly allowed to view them, anyway.
The museum said it will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "indian capital, delhi",
  "artists, singapore item"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "indian capital, delhi" - The article does not mention Delhi as the location where the sculpture was stolen. Instead, it states that the sculpture was stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, India. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "artists, singapore item" - The article does not mention anything about an artist from Singapore or an item from Singapore. The article only mentions that the Asian Civilisation Museum in Singapore purchased the sculpture from a dealer in New York. Therefore, this statement in the summary is also not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains two statements that are not supported by the article, and therefore the summary is not consistent with the article.
