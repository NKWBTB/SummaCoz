<Article>
The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) bought the artwork for $650,000 (Â£420,000) from New York dealer Art of the Past in 2007.
The company's manager later admitted selling stolen Indian antiquities, including the bronze being returned.
The allegations first came to light during a 2012 court case against the firm for trafficking antiquities.
The sculpture of Hindu goddess Uma Parameshvari is thought to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu in southern India.
The decision to return the item came after discussions between Singapore's National Heritage Board and the Indian government body looking after its antiquities, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
The ASI submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May, according to the museum.
"While there is no conclusive proof that the sculpture was stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, India, ACM took note of the confession of Aaron Freedman, who was the manager of Art of the Past, of dealing in looted Indian antiquities and of criminal possession of 150 stolen objects," the museum said in a statement.
It was one of 30 objects ACM bought from the art dealer, although none of the others are thought to be listed as stolen. The ASI was reportedly allowed to view them, anyway.
The museum said it will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that one of India's most iconic artists has been stolen from a temple in Delhi.

Inconsistency: This statement is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention any theft or loss of an artwork from a temple in Delhi. Instead, it reports that the Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) bought the sculpture of Hindu goddess Uma Parameshvari from a New York dealer in 2007, and that the sculpture is believed to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, India.

2. The summary mentions "Singapore item," which suggests that the stolen artwork is located in Singapore.

Inconsistency: This statement is also not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention any connection between the sculpture and Singapore. Instead, it reports that the ACM bought the sculpture from a New York dealer and that the ASI submitted an official request for its return.

3. The summary does not provide any information about the confession of Aaron Freedman, the manager of Art of the Past, or the fact that the ACM will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud.

Inconsistency: This lack of information is a significant inconsistency with the article, as the article reports that Freedman admitted selling stolen Indian antiquities, including the bronze being returned, and that the ACM will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information and omits important details. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article.
