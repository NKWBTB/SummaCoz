The film's star Shailene Woodley also picked up best female performance, the Trailblazer Award and best kiss for a scene with Ansel Elgort.

Other winners included Bradley Cooper, who won best male performance for his role as the late Chris Kyle in American Sniper.
The 40-year-old actor said: "Chris Kyle would have turned 41 four days ago. Chris, this is for you," said Cooper.
Channing Tatum took home best comedic performance for 22 Jump Street and Meryl Streep picked up best villain for her role in Into the Woods.
Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lawrence, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne were also among the winners.
Kevin Hart, who was the target of many size-related jokes throughout the night, brought his kids on stage to accept the comedic genius award.
He said: "I do it all for them. I'm trying to leave a legacy behind."
In one of the more energetic moments of the show, Robert Downey Jr brought his fellow Avengers stars to their knees while accepting the Generation Award.
Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all took the stage to present their co-star with the award, which Downey called "the recognition I so desire".

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that JK Rowling was named the best actor, but the article does not mention anything about JK Rowling winning any awards.
2. The summary mentions the author John Green, but the article does not mention him either.
3. The summary talks about the winners of the awards, but the article does not provide any information about the winners. Instead, it focuses on the ceremony and the upcoming summer releases.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides information that is not present in the article. The article does not discuss the winners of any awards, and it does not mention JK Rowling or John Green.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that JK Rowling was named the best actor, but the article does not mention anything about JK Rowling winning any awards.
