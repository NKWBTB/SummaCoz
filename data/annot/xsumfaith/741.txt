Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jason Mooney is a footballer who has joined Alfreton Town on a two-year deal from Tranmere Rovers.
2. The summary claims that Alfreton Town have signed goalkeeper Jason Mooney on loan from League Two side York for the rest of the season.
3. The article does not mention anything about Mooney being a goalkeeper, nor does it mention York as the club he has joined.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not supported by the text. Specifically, the claim that Mooney is a goalkeeper and that he has joined York on loan is not accurate.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains false information about Mooney's position and the club he has joined.
