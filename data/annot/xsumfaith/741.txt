</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jason Mooney joined York City on a two-year deal in May, but has only made five appearances.
2. The summary states that Alfreton Town have signed Jason Mooney on loan from League Two side York for the rest of the season.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. If Mooney has only made five appearances for York, it is unlikely that he would be available for loan to another team for the rest of the season.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement in the summary is likely to be incorrect.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it claims that Mooney has been signed on loan by Alfreton Town, when in fact, he has only made a few appearances for York City and is unlikely to be available for loan.
