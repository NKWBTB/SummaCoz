He is available for Alfreton's game against Welling United on Saturday. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alfreton Town has signed Jason Mooney on loan from League Two side York for the rest of the season.
2. However, the article states that Mooney has only made five appearances for York since joining them in May, which suggests that he has not been a regular player for the team.
3. Therefore, it is unlikely that York would be willing to loan out a player who has not been a regular member of their squad, especially to a team in a lower league like Alfreton Town.
4. Moreover, the article mentions that Mooney has had previous stints at Wycombe and Oxford City, but does not mention anything about him joining York. This suggests that the summary's information about Mooney joining York is incorrect.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reason for this inconsistency is that the summary contains incorrect information about Mooney's playing history and current club.
