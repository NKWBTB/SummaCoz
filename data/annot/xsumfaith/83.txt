    Summary: 
    conor mcmanus scored a hat-trick as alloa came from behind to beat alloa athletic. 

    Article: 
    McManus netted from close range on the quarter-hour mark to open the scoring and Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead.
A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time.
But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Conor McManus scored a hat-trick. However, the article states that McManus netted one goal and Denny Johnstone scored another goal late on, but it does not mention a hat-trick for McManus.
2. The summary states that Alloa came from behind to beat Alloa Athletic, but the article does not mention Alloa Athletic as a team. Instead, it refers to the opposing team as Morton.
3. The summary does not mention Kyle McAusland's goal, which is mentioned in the article as pulling Alloa back into the game before half-time.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. Specifically, it misrepresents the number of goals scored by McManus, refers to the opposing team incorrectly, and leaves out important information about McAusland's goal.
