]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that McManus netted from close range to open the scoring, and that Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead. This means that Morton was leading 2-0 at some point in the game.
2. The summary states that Conor McManus scored a hat-trick as Alloa came from behind to beat Alloa Athletic. This implies that Alloa was trailing at some point in the game, but then came back to win.
3. However, the article does not mention anything about Alloa being behind. Instead, it states that McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time, but Morton still led 2-1 at the break.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Alloa came from behind to beat Alloa Athletic is not supported by the article. The article does not mention Alloa being behind, and it does not mention a comeback victory for Alloa.
5. Additionally, the statement that Conor McManus scored a hat-trick is also not supported by the article. The article only mentions one goal scored by McManus, and it does not mention any other goals scored by him.

So, the summary has consistency issues because it contains statements that are not supported by the article. Specifically, the statements about Alloa being behind and McManus scoring a hat-trick are not accurate based on the information provided in the article.
