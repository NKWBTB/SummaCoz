1. The article states that McManus netted from close range to open the scoring, but the summary states that Alloa came from behind to beat Morton. This is inconsistent as Alloa was behind in the game.
2. The article states that Ross Forbes' deflected strike doubled Morton's lead, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it states that Alloa came from behind to beat Morton, which is not supported by the article.
3. The article states that Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it states that Alloa came from behind to beat Morton, which is not supported by the article.
4. The article states that another McManus finish and a goal by Denny Johnstone ensured a comfortable win for the hosts, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it states that Alloa came from behind to beat Morton, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events described in the article. The summary states that Alloa came from behind to beat Morton, but the article states that Morton led for most of the game and won comfortably.
