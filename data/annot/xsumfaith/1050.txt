    Summary: 
    new zealand legend paul kalus has said he would be playing the cast of black panther, according to co-star paul o \'connell. 

    Article: 
    He told The Hollywood Reporter he was "super excited" and wanted "to put a different spin on it", but did not expand on what role he would play.
The film will see Jordan reunite with his Creed director Ryan Coogler.
"I'm looking forward to working with Ryan once again. It's gonna be a good time," he said.
He added he could not wait to work with Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014, as well as Chadwick Boseman - who is currently on the big screen playing Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War.
Jordan played the Human Torch in last year's Fantastic Four flop reboot.  Nyong'o also played CGI character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Black Panther will be released in February 2018. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Paul Kalus will play the cast of Black Panther, but the article does not mention Paul Kalus at all.
2. The article mentions Michael B. Jordan, who will play a role in the film, but there is no mention of Paul Kalus.
3. The summary quotes Paul O'Connell, but the article does not mention Paul O'Connell either.
4. The article does mention Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong'o, who will also be in the film, but there is no mention of Paul Kalus.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Paul Kalus, who does not exist in the article. The article only mentions Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, and Lupita Nyong'o.
