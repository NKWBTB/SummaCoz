<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
Opener Stuart Thompson hit 56 while Gary Wilson (41 no) and captain William Porterfield (39) added valuable runs as Ireland made 165-5 in Greater Noida.
It was not enough with Samiullah Shenwari (56) and Mohammad Shahzad (47) helping the Afghans to 171-4 with two overs to spare.
The sides meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday.
Ireland suffered an early blow when opener Paul Stirling was dismissed for a duck and with just one run on the board.
Thompson and Porterfield steadied the innings before Wilson helped the Irish to a competitive total.
Shahzad and Najeeb Tarakai (27) put on an opening stand of 51 as Afghanistan cruised to their victory target.
Afghan spinner Amir Hamza (2-23) was the only bowler to take more than one wicket on a day when the bat dominated.
"We fell a little bit short of potentially a very big score. We could have added another 15 and gotten up to the 180 we were looking for," said Porterfield.
"As well as we played I thought we just came up short with the ball. We didn't quite execute things as well as we would have liked."
The loss of paceman Boyd Rankin for the T20s, because of a back problem, was another setback for the Irish on Wednesday.
Rankin is expected to return for the five ODIs against Afghanistan, starting on 15 March.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "afghanistan",
  "beat afghanistan",
  "nine tries",
  "final of the first"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "Afghanistan": The article never mentions the word "Afghanistan" at all. The article is about a T20 match between Ireland and Afghanistan, but the word "Afghanistan" is not present in the summary.
2. "beat Afghanistan": The article does not mention that Ireland beat Afghanistan. In fact, the article states that Afghanistan won the match.
3. "nine tries": The article does not mention the word "tries" at all. The article is about a cricket match, and there is no mention of rugby or any other sport that involves tries.
4. "final of the first": The article does not mention a "final" or any other competition. The article is simply a report of the match between Ireland and Afghanistan.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues with the following spans:

* "Afghanistan"
* "beat Afghanistan"
* "nine tries"
* "final of the first"

These spans are not supported by the article and are therefore inconsistent with the original text.
