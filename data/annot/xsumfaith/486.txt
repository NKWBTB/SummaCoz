Find out why.

<Article>
Acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Fine Gael and Micheál Martin of  Fianna Fáil hope to avoid a second election.
Mr Martin has said his party will facilitate a minority government, but will not support a programme for government.
Water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement.
A commission to consider the future of national water utility Irish Water is one of the proposals being considered.
Fianna Fáil want to see the immediate removal of water charges, but Fine Gael see a role for them.
Following the election, almost two months ago, Fine Gael had 50 seats, Fianna Fáil 44, Sinn Féin 23 and the Labour Party got seven.
But no party was able to form a majority government and TDs have so far failed to elect a taoiseach.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Micheál Martin is to step down as leader of Fianna Fáil, but the article does not mention anything about him stepping down.
2. The article states that Fianna Fáil will facilitate a minority government but will not support a programme for government, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that Martin is stepping down.
3. The article mentions water charges as one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement, but the summary does not mention anything about water charges or the negotiations to form a government.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The statement about Micheál Martin stepping down is not supported by the information in the article.
