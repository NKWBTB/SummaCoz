<Article>
Acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Fine Gael and Micheál Martin of  Fianna Fáil hope to avoid a second election.
Mr Martin has said his party will facilitate a minority government, but will not support a programme for government.
Water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement.
A commission to consider the future of national water utility Irish Water is one of the proposals being considered.
Fianna Fáil want to see the immediate removal of water charges, but Fine Gael see a role for them.
Following the election, almost two months ago, Fine Gael had 50 seats, Fianna Fáil 44, Sinn Féin 23 and the Labour Party got seven.
But no party was able to form a majority government and TDs have so far failed to elect a taoiseach.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Micheál Martin is the leader of Fianna Fáil, but the summary states that he is to step down as leader of Fianna Fáil in the Republic of Ireland. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Martin stepping down as leader.
2. The article mentions that Fianna Fáil wants to see the immediate removal of water charges, but the summary does not mention anything about water charges or Fianna Fáil's stance on them. This is a significant omission, as water charges are one of the main sticking points in the formation of a government.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the election or the failure to elect a Taoiseach, which are the main focuses of the article. This is a significant inconsistency, as the article provides information about the political situation in Ireland and the attempts to form a government.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important information about Fianna Fáil's stance on water charges and the election, and it includes inaccurate information about Martin stepping down as leader.
