    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Chris Jones, a BBC radio presenter, was born on a Sunday night for the first time.
2. However, the article states that Chris Jones was born on a Sunday morning, not at night.
3. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains incorrect information about the time of day when Chris Jones was born.
4. The article states that Chris Jones was born in the morning of Sunday, 22 January, weighing 7lbs 11.
5. Therefore, the summary is not only inconsistent with the article, but it also contains false information about the time of day when Chris Jones was born.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the time of day when Chris Jones was born. The article states that Chris Jones was born in the morning, not at night, as the summary claims.
