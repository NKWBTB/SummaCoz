</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "for the first time",
  "bbc radio presenter chris",
  "chris",
  "sunday night"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "for the first time": The article does not mention that this is Chris Jones' first child or that he has never had a baby before. In fact, the article states that Chris Jones has a partner named Charlie Thomson and that they have a baby together. Therefore, the phrase "for the first time" is not supported by the article.
2. "bbc radio presenter chris": The article does not mention Chris Jones' job title or that he is a BBC radio presenter. The article only mentions that he is a 39-year-old man from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire.
3. "chris": The article does not mention the name "Chris" at all. The name of the person in the article is "Chris Jones."
4. "sunday night": The article states that the baby was born on a Sunday morning, not Sunday night.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations.
