</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Ms. Jones gave birth to her first child on Sunday, January 22nd, weighing 7lbs 11.
2. The summary states that Chris Jones (not Ms. Jones) was born on Sunday night.
3. Ms. Jones is the one who gave birth, not Chris Jones.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to a different person (Chris Jones) giving birth, instead of Ms. Jones.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly refers to a different person (Chris Jones) giving birth, instead of Ms. Jones.
