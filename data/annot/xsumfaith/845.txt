     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that winds have been canceled due to bad weather conditions, while the article does not mention any cancellations due to wind. Instead, it reports on the impact of the wind on various activities and events.
2. The summary mentions "torrential rain," which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions power cuts, train delays, and speed restrictions due to strong winds.
3. The summary does not mention any specific locations or events mentioned in the article, such as Rhosgadfan, Caernarfon, Gwynedd, or the Irish Sea.

Therefore, based on these differences, the given summary is not consistent with the article.
