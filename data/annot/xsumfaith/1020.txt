    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Accrington Stanley has signed Tom Browning on loan until the end of the season.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Accrington Stanley signing Tom Browning. Instead, it mentions that Browning has progressed through the youth system at Everton and made nine appearances for the Toffees.
3. The article also mentions that Browning missed the end of last season with a knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year.
4. Therefore, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of Tom Browning joining Accrington Stanley. The article only discusses his background and injury history with Everton.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Tom Browning has joined Accrington Stanley, when in fact, he has not.
