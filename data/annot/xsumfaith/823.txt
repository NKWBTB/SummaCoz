    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the proportion of Americans lacking health insurance in the UK has fallen sharply. However, the article does not mention anything about the UK. The article is specifically about poverty and income inequality in the United States.
2. The summary mentions a report, but the article does not mention any report. The article is based on data from the US Census Bureau.
3. The summary states that the proportion of Americans lacking health insurance fell to 15.7% from 16.3%. However, the article does not mention anything about health insurance or the percentage of Americans without health insurance. The article is focused on poverty and income inequality.
4. The summary mentions a record high poverty rate in 2010, but the article does not mention any record high poverty rate. The article states that the poverty rate was 15% in 2011, which is not the same as a record high.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions the UK, a report, health insurance, and a record high poverty rate, none of which are mentioned in the article. The article is focused on poverty and income inequality in the United States, and the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
