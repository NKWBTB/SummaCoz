</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the company is launching a new Android handset, the Dtek50, which suggests that the company is not shutting down its Android operating system.
2. The article mentions that the company is switching focus away from its BB10 platform, which implies that the company is continuing to produce Android devices.
3. The summary states that the company is shutting down its Android operating system, which is not supported by the information in the article.
4. The article mentions that the company is launching a new Android handset, which contradicts the claim in the summary that the company is shutting down its Android operating system.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reason for this inconsistency is that the summary contains false information.
