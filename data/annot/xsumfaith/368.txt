For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

  "swedish mobile phone firm company has announced it is shutting down its android operating system"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the company is launching a new Android handset, the Dtek50, which suggests that the company is not shutting down its Android operating system.
2. The article mentions that the company is switching focus away from its struggling BB10 platform, which implies that the company is continuing to develop and support its Android devices.
3. The summary states that the company is shutting down its Android operating system, which is not supported by the information in the article.
4. The article does not mention anything about the company shutting down its Android operating system, nor does it suggest that the company is discontinuing its Android devices.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement about the company shutting down its Android operating system is incorrect.

Overall, the inconsistency between the summary and the article is due to the fact that the summary contains false information about the company shutting down its Android operating system, which is not supported by the article.
