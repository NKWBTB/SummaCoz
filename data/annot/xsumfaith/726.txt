For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

  "a fire involving about 100 tonnes of waste wood and rubbish in newport was started deliberately, the police and fire service have said"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the fire occurred in Bloomery Circle, Llanwern, but the summary states that the fire was in Newport. This is inconsistent, as Newport is a different location from Llanwern.
2. The article mentions that the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers, but the summary does not mention this detail. This is inconsistent, as the summary should include all relevant information from the article.
3. The article states that the fire was believed to have been deliberately set, but the summary does not mention this detail. This is inconsistent, as the summary should include all relevant information from the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect location information, leaves out important details about the burning material, and fails to mention the suspicion of arson.
