    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the fire involved about 100 tonnes of waste wood and rubbish, while the article only mentions a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers. This discrepancy indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The article states that the fire burned for more than 10 hours before it was extinguished, while the summary does not mention the duration of the fire. This omission suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's information.
3. The article quotes a Gwent Police spokesman as saying that officers are investigating the circumstances surrounding the fire, which is believed to have been deliberately set. However, the summary does not mention anything about the fire being deliberately set. This lack of information suggests that the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it appears that the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content and may not be reliable.
