It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.
So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it.
Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online.
The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.

<Summary>
images courtesy of afp, epa, getty images and climbers and other sea creatures in the ocean have been caught on camera.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the team is using a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer to explore the Mariana Trench, and that the expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes, and deep sea coral.
2. The summary mentions "images courtesy of afp, epa, getty images." These are all news agencies that provide images to the media, but there is no mention of these images being related to the Deep Discoverer expedition or the Mariana Trench in the article.
3. The summary also mentions "climbers and other sea creatures in the ocean." There is no mention of climbers or other sea creatures in the article, and it is unlikely that the Deep Discoverer expedition would be exploring the ocean for climbers or other sea creatures, as their focus is on exploring the deepest parts of the trench.

Therefore, the inconsistency in the summary is that it mentions things that are not present in the article (images from news agencies and climbers/other sea creatures), and it does not accurately reflect the focus of the Deep Discoverer expedition as described in the article.
