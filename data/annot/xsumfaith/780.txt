Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the team is using a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer to explore the Mariana Trench and that the expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes, and deep sea coral.
2. The summary states that "images courtesy of afp, epa, getty images and climbers and other sea creatures in the ocean have been caught on camera."
3. The article does not mention anything about images or photographs of sea creatures or climbers being caught on camera. Instead, it mentions that the team is using a camera on the Deep Discoverer submarine to explore the trench.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions photographs and sea creatures, which are not mentioned in the article.
