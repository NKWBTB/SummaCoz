Find out why.

<Article>
Lancashire County Council has earmarked land on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College.
The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused.
The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre.
Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956.
The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council.
County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an "exciting step forward".
He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion.
He added: "It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area."
The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land.
Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961..
It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "south",
  "former"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "south": The article does not mention anything about the location of the new railway station being in the south of Lancashire. In fact, the article states that the proposed site is in Skelmersdale, which is located in the north west of England. Therefore, the mention of "south" in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "former": The article does not mention anything about the site being a former railway station. The article states that the site is the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College, but it does not use the word "former" to describe the site. Therefore, the mention of "former" in the summary is also not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains two inconsistencies with the article: the location of the new railway station is not in the south of Lancashire, and the site is not a former railway station.
