<Article>
Lancashire County Council has earmarked land on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College.
The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused.
The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre.
Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956.
The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council.
County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an "exciting step forward".
He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion.
He added: "It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area."
The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land.
Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961..
It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a new railway station is to be built on a former railway station site in south Lancashire.
2. However, the article states that the new railway station will be built on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College sites, not on a former railway station site.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the sites being former sports colleges or colleges, which is a key detail in the article.
4. The article states that Skelmersdale has not had a railway station since 1956, but the summary does not mention this fact.
5. The article mentions that the new railway station will have two direct trains to Liverpool per hour, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the details of the new railway station's location, the fact that the site is a former sports college and college, and the lack of a railway station in Skelmersdale since 1956. Additionally, the summary does not mention the possibility of future expansion or the good highway access and connectivity to the town and surrounding area, which are important details in the article.
