</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Ayr United remain third in the table, indicating that they were the home team and won the match.
2. The summary states that Ayr United moved to within a point of the play-off places, which is inconsistent with the article.
3. The article mentions that the visitors scored two quick fire goals, which suggests that Ayr United was the away team and lost the match.
4. The summary does not mention any details about the match, such as the score or the goalscorers, which suggests that it is not a reliable summary of the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a mistake or a misleading summary.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Ayr United moved to within a point of the play-off places with victory over bottom side Ayr United. The summary does not make common sense, as Ayr United can not win Ayr United themselves.
2. The article does not mention anything about within a point of the play-off places.
