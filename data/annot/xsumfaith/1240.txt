    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ayr United moved to within a point of the Scottish League One play-off places with a victory over bottom side Ayr United.

This is incorrect because Ayr United is the bottom side, and they lost the match. Therefore, they cannot have moved within a point of the play-off places.

2. The article states that Pars goalkeeper Sean Murdoch denied Jamie Adams in a first half of few chances before two quick fire goals put the visitors in control.

This suggests that Ayr United was the visiting team and they scored two goals in quick succession to take control of the match. However, the summary states that Ayr United lost the match.

3. The article also mentions that El Bakhtaoui raced on to a Ryan Wallace ball to score his first, before scoring a stunning 30-yard volley from Michael Paton's cross.

This suggests that Ayr United scored two goals, but the summary only mentions one goal.

4. Finally, the article states that Craig Moore fired a late chance over for Ayr United, who remain third.

This suggests that Ayr United remained in third place after the match, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events of the match.
