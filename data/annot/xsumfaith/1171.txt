It will be able to issue warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws.
The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT.
Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work.
People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary.
However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached.
James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Powys Council will receive £170,000 per year to carry out the work of the former Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in relation to estate agents. This suggests that Powys Council will be responsible for enforcing the Estate Agents Act and issuing warning and banning orders to agents who breach the law.
2. The article does not mention anything about estate agents in Powys considering banning agents operating on their estate. In fact, the article states that people complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, which suggests that the estate agents in Powys will not be involved in banning agents.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it suggests that estate agents in Powys are considering banning agents operating on their estate, which is not mentioned in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article. The article does not mention estate agents in Powys considering banning agents, and the summary should not have included this information.
