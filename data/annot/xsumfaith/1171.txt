It will be able to issue warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws.
The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT.
Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work.
People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary.
However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached.
James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future.
He spoke to Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales' Peter Johnson about what the new role will involve.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that estate agents in Powys are considering banning agents operating on their estate, but the article does not mention anything about estate agents being banned. Instead, the article states that Powys Council will be responsible for enforcing the Estate Agents Act and issuing warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws.
2. The summary implies that the estate agents in Powys are taking some kind of action against other agents, but the article does not support this. The article only mentions that Powys Council will be responsible for enforcing the Estate Agents Act.
3. The summary mentions "estate agents operating on their estate," which is not a phrase that appears in the article. The article only mentions "estate agents" and "agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws."

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that estate agents in Powys are taking some kind of action against other agents, when the article only mentions that Powys Council will be responsible for enforcing the Estate Agents Act.
