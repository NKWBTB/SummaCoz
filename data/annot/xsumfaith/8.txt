<Article>
The Reds, who are fifth in National Two South, beat third-placed Chinnor 29-12 for a second win in a row.
"Tommy Phillips, Ben Priddey and Craig Williams really led the team from the front," Churcher told BBC Cornwall.
"If your front row and front five are making 70-plus tackles in a game you're going to be doing well and that's what happened against Chinnor."
The Reds face seven teams who are below them in the table in their next eight games, as well as league leaders Old Elthamians.
Churcher believes his side still has a lot of room for improvement, adding: "Chinnor wasn't the complete performance, but emotionally it was a really dogged performance.
"We've got to build on what we did last weekend, because if we don't, last weekend will have been a waste of time."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Truro City beat Chinnor 29-12, but the summary only mentions the team's performance in the first half of the campaign. This is inconsistent because the article is specifically discussing the team's recent win against Chinnor, not their overall performance in the first half of the season.
2. The summary refers to Marek Churcher as the "truro city head coach", but the article uses the name "Marek Churcher" without the title "truro city head coach". This is inconsistent because the article does not use the title "truro city head coach" to refer to Churcher.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions the team's performance in the first half of the campaign, and it uses a title ("truro city head coach") that is not used in the article.
