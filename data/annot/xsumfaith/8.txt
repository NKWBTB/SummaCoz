    Summary: 
    truro city head coach marek churcher has praised his side\'s performance in the first half of their national rugby league campaign. 

    Article: 
    The Reds, who are fifth in National Two South, beat third-placed Chinnor 29-12 for a second win in a row.
"Tommy Phillips, Ben Priddey and Craig Williams really led the team from the front," Churcher told BBC Cornwall.
"If your front row and front five are making 70-plus tackles in a game you're going to be doing well and that's what happened against Chinnor."
The Reds face seven teams who are below them in the table in their next eight games, as well as league leaders Old Elthamians.
Churcher believes his side still has a lot of room for improvement, adding: "Chinnor wasn't the complete performance, but emotionally it was a really dogged performance.
"We've got to build on what we did last weekend, because if we don't, last weekend will have been a waste of time." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Truro City Head Coach Marek Churcher praised his side's performance in the first half of their national rugby league campaign. However, the article does not mention anything about the first half of the campaign.
2. The article only mentions the team's recent win against Chinnor, and Churcher's comments are focused on that specific game. There is no mention of the team's performance in the first half of the campaign.
3. The summary is not supported by the article because the article does not provide any information about the team's performance in the first half of the campaign. The article only provides information about the team's recent win against Chinnor and Churcher's comments on that game.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim (the team's performance in the first half of the campaign) that is not supported by the information in the article.
