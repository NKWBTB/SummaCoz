    Summary: 
    a student has been taken to hospital after a " suspicious " explosion at a cardiff university campus. 

    Article: 
    The university said the move at Singleton Park was "precautionary".
South Wales Police received a call at about 13:30 BST after concerns about the safe storage of chemicals before a controlled explosion took place.
Nobody was injured and a police spokesman said a cordon erected was precautionary while the chemicals were removed.
Student Alex Jones said there was "some panic" at the start of the incident and lectures were moved away from the area to other buildings.
South Wales Police said the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public.
The university said the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals "had become unstable". 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that the incident was not treated as suspicious by the police, and there was no risk to the public.

2. The article also states that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals "had become unstable".

3. However, the summary states that the explosion was "suspicious". This is inconsistent with the article, as the police did not treat the incident as suspicious.

4. Therefore, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly describes the nature of the explosion as "suspicious", when the article states that it was a controlled explosion carried out by the bomb disposal unit due to the instability of the chemicals.
