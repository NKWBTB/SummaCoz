Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a student was taken to the hospital after a "suspicious" explosion at a Cardiff University campus.
2. The article does not mention any hospitalization or injuries.

4. The article mentions that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals had become unstable.
