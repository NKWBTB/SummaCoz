</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Ben Browning is a former England Under-21 international who has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for Everton.
2. The article also mentions that Browning missed the end of last season with a knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year.
3. The summary states that Championship side Everton have signed Everton midfielder Ben Browning on a season-long loan deal.

The inconsistency between the article and the summary is that the article refers to Browning as a current Everton player, while the summary refers to him as a player for a different team (Championship side Everton). This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it suggests that Browning is joining a different team on loan, whereas the article states that he is already a member of the Everton team.
