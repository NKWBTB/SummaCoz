     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Everton has signed Ben Browning on a season-long loan deal, implying that he is joining the club from another team.
2. However, the article states that Browning is an Everton midfielder who has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for the Toffees. This means that he is already a part of the club and does not need to be signed on loan.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Browning is joining Everton from another team, while the article states that he is already a part of the club.

In conclusion, the summary is not accurate because it contains information that is not supported by the article.
