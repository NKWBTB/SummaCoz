]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Ben Browning is an England Under-21 international who has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for Everton.
2. The article also mentions that Browning missed the end of last season with a knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year.
3. Based on these facts, it is clear that Browning is a current player for Everton, and therefore it is inconsistent to refer to Everton as a "championship side" in the summary, as the article does not suggest that the team is in the Championship.
4. Additionally, the summary states that Browning has been signed on a season-long loan deal, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions that Browning missed the end of last season with an injury.
5. Therefore, the spans in the summary that have consistency issues are "championship side everton" and "season-long loan deal," as these statements are not supported by the information in the article.
