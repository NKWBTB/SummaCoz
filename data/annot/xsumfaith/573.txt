</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a woman died after her car crashed outside a bus depot, trapping 150 buses inside.
2. The article does not mention any deaths or buses being trapped inside a depot. Instead, it reports that the Lower Bristol Road was closed after a crash and that investigations are underway.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Here's why the summary is not accurate:

* The article does not mention any deaths, but the summary states that a woman died.
* The article does not mention any buses being trapped inside a depot, but the summary states that 150 buses were trapped.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content.
