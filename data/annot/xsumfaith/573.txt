</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "a woman has died after her car crashed outside a bus depot trapping 150 buses inside"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Lower Bristol Road was closed after a crash, but it does not mention any fatalities. The summary states that a woman has died, which is not supported by the article.
2. The article mentions that 150 buses were affected by the road closure, but it does not say that they were trapped inside the bus depot. The summary implies that the buses were trapped inside the depot, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two statements that are not supported by the information provided in the article.
