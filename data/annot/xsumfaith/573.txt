    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a woman died after her car crashed outside a bus depot, trapping 150 buses inside.

2. The article does not mention any fatalities or casualties. Instead, it reports that a road was closed due to a crash and that investigations are underway.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information about a fatality, which is not present in the article.

4. The article only mentions the closure of a road and the disruption caused to commuters and bus services, but it does not mention any fatalities or casualties.

5. The summary is not supported by the information in the article, and therefore it is not a consistent summary of the article's content.
