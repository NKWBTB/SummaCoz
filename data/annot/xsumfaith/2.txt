The Cherries went down 2-1 at Sunderland on Saturday, becoming the first team to lose to the Black Cats in the Premier League this season.
Dan Gosling's goal, which gave them the lead, was their first for three games.
"It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games."
He continued: "A couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take."
Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser, even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar's dismissal.
"We've had enough chances to win three games today," Howe added.
"Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it. It's how you move on from that which is key."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "manager eddie",
  "struggling \" after losing 2-0 to hull",
  "side are \" struggling \" after losing 2-0"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Bournemouth lost 2-1 to Sunderland, not 2-0 to Hull. Therefore, the summary's statement that Bournemouth lost 2-0 to Hull is incorrect.
2. The article quotes Eddie Howe as saying "It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence. We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games." This suggests that Bournemouth did well against Hull, scoring six goals, and therefore it is unlikely that they are struggling.
3. The summary states that Eddie Howe says his side are "struggling" after losing 2-0 to Hull. However, the article quotes Howe as saying the opposite - that the team should not be struggling due to their recent performance against Hull.
4. The summary also states that the side are "struggling" after losing 2-0 to Hull, but the article does not mention anything about the team struggling. In fact, the article quotes Howe as saying that the team has had enough chances to win three games, which suggests that they are not struggling.

Therefore, the consistency issues in the summary are:

* The summary states that Bournemouth lost 2-0 to Hull, but the article states that they lost 2-1 to Sunderland.
* The summary quotes Eddie Howe as saying the team is struggling, but the article quotes Howe as saying the opposite.
* The summary states that the team is struggling after losing 2-0 to Hull, but the article does not mention anything about the team struggling.
