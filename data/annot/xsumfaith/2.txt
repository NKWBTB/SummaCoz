The Cherries went down 2-1 at Sunderland on Saturday, becoming the first team to lose to the Black Cats in the Premier League this season.
Dan Gosling's goal, which gave them the lead, was their first for three games.
"It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games."
He continued: "A couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take."
Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser, even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar's dismissal.
"We've had enough chances to win three games today," Howe added.
"Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it. It's how you move on from that which is key."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Bournemouth lost 2-1 to Sunderland, not Hull.
2. The summary states that Bournemouth lost 2-0 to Hull, which is not consistent with the article.
3. The article quotes Eddie Howe as saying "We've had enough chances to win three games today," indicating that Bournemouth had plenty of opportunities to score and were unlucky to lose.
4. The summary, on the other hand, states that Bournemouth are "struggling" after losing to Hull, which suggests that they were not creating many chances or scoring goals.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Bournemouth are struggling to score goals, while the article states that they had plenty of chances to win the game.
