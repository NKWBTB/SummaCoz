    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has been arrested after a tractor and a tractor was seized by police in a tractor and trailer. 

    Article: 
    The John Deere tractor was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley and had two other males on board.
The vehicle had been seen in nearby Harrogate at about 05:00 GMT with no headlights on.
Police said the driver had no licence, was not insured and did not have permission from the tractor's owner.
The vehicle was seized, with the three due to be interviewed by officers.
Posting on Twitter, Insp Chris Galley said: "A strange end to a night shift. 15-year-old lad driving a tractor as a taxi for his drunk mates." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the driver of the tractor was a 15-year-old lad, but the summary mentions "a man" being arrested. This is not consistent, as the article only refers to a juvenile driver.

2. The summary mentions "a tractor and a trailer" being seized, but the article only mentions a single John Deere tractor being pulled over. This is not consistent, as there is no mention of a trailer in the article.

3. The summary states that the driver had no license, was not insured, and did not have permission from the owner, but the article only mentions that the driver had no license and was not insured. This is not consistent, as there is no mention of the driver not having permission from the owner in the article.

4. The summary mentions that the vehicle was seen in Harrogate with no headlights on, but the article does not mention this. This is not consistent, as there is no information in the article about the vehicle being seen in Harrogate or having no headlights on.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and may contain inaccuracies or misinformation.
