</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the driver of the tractor was a 15-year-old boy, while the summary claims that a man was arrested. This is a inconsistency, as the article does not mention the arrest of a man.
2. The article states that the tractor was seized, but the summary claims that a tractor and trailer were seized. This is another inconsistency, as the article only mentions the seizure of the tractor.
3. The article states that the driver of the tractor was driving without a license, and that the vehicle was not insured. The summary does not mention these details.
4. The article states that the police posted on Twitter about the incident, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
