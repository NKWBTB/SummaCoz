<Summary>
a man has been arrested after a tractor and a tractor was seized by police in a tractor and trailer.
</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "trailer",
  "man has been arrested after a tractor"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "trailer" - The article does not mention a trailer. The article only mentions a tractor being seized by the police. The summary incorrectly includes a trailer, which is not supported by the article.
2. "man has been arrested after a tractor" - The article does not mention an arrest. The article only mentions that the driver of the tractor was not licensed, did not have permission from the owner, and was not insured. The summary incorrectly includes an arrest, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the two spans in the summary that have consistency issues are "trailer" and "man has been arrested after a tractor". These errors indicate that the summary is not consistent with the article and may be inaccurate.
