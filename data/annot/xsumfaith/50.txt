Find out why.

<Article>
The Australian, 21, beat world number 29 Querrey 6-4 6-4 in 53 minutes to progress to the second round.
Kyrgios, ranked a career-high 12th in the world, won the Japan Open on Sunday and is closing in on the top 10.
"I was just a bit bored at times," said Kyrgios, when asked why he was not his usual vocal self against Querrey.
"I was feeling very tired. It was just tough. I'm just tired so maybe I just wanted to get the job done."
Kyrgios said his success in Japan, and the travelling involved in playing at the Qi Zhong Stadium, an hour from Shanghai city centre, had taken its toll.
"I didn't have the greatest sleep last night and obviously got in late the day before," he said. "The ride to the courts isn't great either."
It was at the Shanghai Masters last year that Kyrgios was fined $1,500 (Â£984) for a foul-mouthed outburst, describing the tournament a "circus".

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "of the shanghai masters",
  "number one",
  "world number one",
  "nick",
  "second round of the shanghai masters"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "of the shanghai masters": The article does not mention "of the shanghai masters" at all. The tournament is simply referred to as the "Shanghai Masters".
2. "number one": The article does not mention the word "number one" at all. The correct phrase would be "world number 29" to describe Querrey's ranking.
3. "world number one": As mentioned above, the article does not mention "world number one" at all.
4. "nick": The article does not mention "nick" at all. The correct name of the player is "Nick Kyrgios".
5. "second round of the shanghai masters": The article states that Kyrgios beat Querrey in the first round, not the second round.

Therefore, the summary has the following consistency issues:

* Incorrect phrase used to describe Querrey's ranking (should be "world number 29" instead of "number one")
* Incorrect phrase used to describe the tournament (should be "Shanghai Masters" instead of "of the shanghai masters")
* Incorrect name of the player (should be "Nick Kyrgios" instead of "nick")
* Incorrect round described (should be "first round" instead of "second round")
