    Summary: 
    a seven-year-old girl has died after being hit by a stone thrown by an elephant from its enclosure at rabat zoo in morocco. 

    Article: 
    The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the girl died after being hit by a stone thrown by an elephant, but the article does not support this claim. Instead, the article states that the girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, without specifying the cause of death.
2. The summary implies that the elephant directly targeted the girl with a stone, but the article suggests that the stone may have been thrown unintentionally or as a result of the elephant's frustration or boredom. The article quotes Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, as saying that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the enclosure met international standards, as stated in the article. This omission could be seen as an attempt to sensationalize the incident and make it seem more severe than it actually was.
4. The summary does not include the quote from Phyllis Lee, which provides important context and suggests that the elephant's behavior may have been a result of frustration or boredom rather than a deliberate attack on the girl.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the severity of the incident, misrepresents the elephant's behavior, and omits important context and quotes from the article.
