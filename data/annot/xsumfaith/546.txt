The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the girl was hit by a stone thrown by an elephant, implying that the elephant directly targeted her.
2. However, the article states that the elephant was not directly targeting the girl, but rather exhibiting frustration.
3. The article also mentions that the enclosure met international standards and that this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable, and unusual.
4. The Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, Phyllis Lee, is quoted as saying that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual and can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored.
5. The article includes a video that shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerving to show a stone on the ground, but does not show the girl being hit by the stone.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the elephant directly targeted the girl, while the article states that the elephant was exhibiting frustration and that this kind of accident is rare and unpredictable. Additionally, the video footage does not show the girl being hit by the stone, which further contradicts the summary.
