The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "morocco",
  "seven-year-old"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, but the summary only mentions that she died. This inconsistency is in the span "hospital".
2. The article mentions that the elephant threw a stone, but the summary only mentions that the elephant threw a stone without specifying that it was a stone. This inconsistency is in the span "stone".
3. The article states that the girl was hit by the stone, but the summary only mentions that she was hit. This inconsistency is in the span "hit".
4. The article mentions that the elephant was in its enclosure, but the summary does not mention this. This inconsistency is in the span "morocco".
5. The article states that the girl was seven years old, but the summary only mentions her age as "seven-year-old". This inconsistency is in the span "seven-year-old".

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey all the information provided in the article.
