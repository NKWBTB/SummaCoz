The US military says a strike targeting Taliban in the northern city of Kunduz may have caused "collateral damage".
Offering his "deepest condolences", Mr Obama said he expected a "full accounting of the facts" and would then make a definitive judgement.
At least 12 MSF staff members and seven patients were killed in the incident.
The UN called the strikes "inexcusable and possibly even criminal", with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon calling for a thorough and impartial investigation.
"International and Afghan military planners have an obligation to respect and protect civilians at all times, and medical facilities and personnel are the object of a special protection," said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Ra'ad Al Hussein Zeid.
The hospital, run by the medical charity MSF, was severely damaged by a series of strikes lasting more than an hour from 02:00 local time on Saturday. Dozens were also injured in the attack.
MSF president Meinie Nicolai described the incident as "abhorrent and a grave violation of international humanitarian law".
"All indications currently point to the bombing being carried out by international Coalition forces," MSF said.
A spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan, Col Brian Tribus, said on Saturday that US forces had conducted an air strike in Kunduz "against individuals threatening the force" at the same time.
He added: "The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility."
President Obama expressed his "deepest condolences" for the deaths in a White House statement.
He added: "The Department of Defense has launched a full investigation, and we will await the results of that inquiry before making a definitive judgment as to the circumstances of this tragedy."
MSF nurse Lajos Zoltan Jecs was sleeping at the facility when it was hit. "It was absolutely terrifying," he said.
He saw a fellow nurse "covered in blood, with wounds all over his body", a statement issued by MSF said.
Mr Jecs and other staff went outside when the bombing stopped.  "What we saw was the hospital destroyed. We tried to take a look into one of the burning buildings. There are no words for how terrible it was. In the intensive care unit six patients were burning in their beds."
The Afghan interior ministry said a group of 10 to 15 militants had been hiding in the hospital.
The Taliban denied that any of its fighters were there.
A Taliban statement described the air strikes which hit the hospital as "deliberate", and carried out by "the barbaric American forces".
There has been intense fighting in Kunduz since Taliban fighters swept into the northern city on Monday.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that President Obama called for an international inquiry into the Taliban attack on an Afghan hospital, but the article does not mention any such inquiry. Instead, the article reports that President Obama expressed his condolences for the deaths and said that the Department of Defense would launch a full investigation.
2. The summary refers to the attack as a "Taliban attack" on an Afghan hospital, but the article does not use the word "Taliban" to describe the attackers. Instead, the article states that the US military conducted an air strike that may have caused "collateral damage" to the hospital.
3. The summary does not mention the death toll or the damage caused by the air strike, while the article reports that at least 12 MSF staff members and seven patients were killed, and the hospital was severely damaged.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It misrepresents the nature of the attack and the response to it, and omits key details about the death toll and the damage caused.
