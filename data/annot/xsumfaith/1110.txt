BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died.
A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset.
The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.
The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to Â£11.7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care "must be eliminated by 2020/21".
"We will work to a faster timetable if at all possible," said a spokeswoman.
"We will consider Dr Carlyon's letter in detail once it arrives." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that an inquest found that a number of mental health patients died, but the article does not mention any specific number of patient deaths. Instead, it focuses on the death of one patient, David Knight, and the inquest's findings regarding his death.

2. The article states that the inquest found that Mr. Knight's death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset. The summary does not mention anything about an inadequate risk assessment or support.

3. The article mentions that the inquest heard that Mr. Knight was being treated at Cygnet Hospital because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall. The summary does not mention anything about the availability of psychiatric beds.

4. The article states that the NHS has placed 30 adult mental patients out of Cornwall in 2015/16, which is a higher number than the previous two years. The summary does not mention anything about the number of patients placed out of the area.

5. The article mentions that the Department of Health has accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce to eliminate the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care by 2020/21. The summary does not mention anything about the Department of Health's plans or recommendations.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary makes no mention of the specific details and findings of the inquest, such as the inadequate risk assessment and support, the availability of psychiatric beds, or the number of patients placed out of the area. Instead, it only mentions a general statement about the death of mental health patients, which is not supported by the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that an inquest found that a number of mental health patients died, but the article does not mention any other patients died. Instead, it focuses on the death of one patient, David Knight, and the inquest's findings regarding his death.
