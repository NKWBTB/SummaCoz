Daniel Timbers, 29, and Barry Joy, 56, were working at Harford Attachments in Spar Road when they were killed, shortly after 09:00 BST on Monday.
The men are believed to have been working in a paint-spraying area.
Their bodies were removed from the site on Tuesday afternoon.
A forensic search has been carried out at the company, which makes buckets for diggers.
Det Ch Insp Paul Durham said "significant progress" had been made with forensic inquiries and obtaining witness statements.
"Evidence gathered so far suggests there has been a flashover explosion, which occurs when you have a build-up of toxic fumes," he said.
"This, combined with some sort of ignition, has caused a fire-ball effect."
The Health and Safety Executive said its inspectors and electrical safety experts would be gathering evidence.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the two men died after a fire at Harford Attachments in Spar Road, but the summary says "scrapyard in Pembrokeshire." This is inconsistent because the article specifically names the location as Harford Attachments, while the summary uses a more general term "scrapyard."
2. The article does not use the word "suspicious" to describe the deaths. Instead, it reports that "significant progress" has been made with forensic inquiries and obtaining witness statements. The summary, on the other hand, states that the deaths are being treated as "suspicious." This is inconsistent because the article does not mention any suspicion or speculation about the cause of the deaths.
3. The article does not mention anything about the location of the fire being in Pembrokeshire. The summary mentions this, but it is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues because it uses different language and includes information that is not supported by the article.
