Daniel Timbers, 29, and Barry Joy, 56, were working at Harford Attachments in Spar Road when they were killed, shortly after 09:00 BST on Monday.
The men are believed to have been working in a paint-spraying area.
Their bodies were removed from the site on Tuesday afternoon.
A forensic search has been carried out at the company, which makes buckets for diggers.
Det Ch Insp Paul Durham said "significant progress" had been made with forensic inquiries and obtaining witness statements.
"Evidence gathered so far suggests there has been a flashover explosion, which occurs when you have a build-up of toxic fumes," he said.
"This, combined with some sort of ignition, has caused a fire-ball effect."
The Health and Safety Executive said its inspectors and electrical safety experts would be gathering evidence.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the deaths of the two men are being treated as "suspicious" by the police.
2. However, the summary only mentions that the deaths are being treated as "suspicious" without providing any details about the circumstances of the deaths or the investigation.
3. The article provides specific details about the location of the incident (Harford Attachments in Spar Road, Pembrokeshire), the time of the incident (shortly after 09:00 BST on Monday), and the fact that a forensic search has been carried out.
4. The summary does not include any of these details, indicating that it is not a consistent summary of the article.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and specific information about the incident and the investigation.
