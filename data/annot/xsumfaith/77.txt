    Summary: 
    the deaths of two men who died after a fire at a scrapyard in pembrokeshire are being treated as " suspicious ", police have said. 

    Article: 
    Daniel Timbers, 29, and Barry Joy, 56, were working at Harford Attachments in Spar Road when they were killed, shortly after 09:00 BST on Monday.
The men are believed to have been working in a paint-spraying area.
Their bodies were removed from the site on Tuesday afternoon.
A forensic search has been carried out at the company, which makes buckets for diggers.
Det Ch Insp Paul Durham said "significant progress" had been made with forensic inquiries and obtaining witness statements.
"Evidence gathered so far suggests there has been a flashover explosion, which occurs when you have a build-up of toxic fumes," he said.
"This, combined with some sort of ignition, has caused a fire-ball effect."
The Health and Safety Executive said its inspectors and electrical safety experts would be gathering evidence.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the deaths are being treated as "suspicious", but the article does not mention anything about the deaths being suspicious. Instead, it focuses on the investigation into the cause of the fire and the explosion.
2. The summary mentions two men dying, but the article only mentions two men who were killed, which is not the same as saying they died. The article states that their bodies were removed from the site on Tuesday afternoon, which suggests that they may have been injured or killed in the fire or explosion, but it does not confirm this.
3. The summary does not mention the name of the company where the men were working, but the article states that the men were working at Harford Attachments in Spar Road.
4. The summary does not mention the cause of the fire or explosion, but the article states that the investigation has revealed that there was a flashover explosion, which occurred when there was a build-up of toxic fumes that were ignited.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that are significant enough to change the meaning of the information being presented.
