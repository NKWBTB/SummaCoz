The restaurant began serving puppy platters after a new law was introduced allowing dogs to eat at restaurants -  as long as they were outdoors!
It looks like a right dog's dinner - check out this clip. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that a new law was introduced allowing dogs to eat at restaurants, but only outdoors.
2. The summary claims that the restaurant in London is encouraging dogs to eat at schools in England and Wales.
3. There is no mention of schools or any reference to indoor settings in the article.
4. The article only mentions outdoor settings and the restaurant serving puppy platters.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions indoor settings (schools) and outdoor settings (restaurants) in the same sentence, which is not supported by the article.
6. Additionally, the article only talks about a new law allowing dogs to eat at restaurants outdoors, but the summary does not mention anything about a law or any specific location (schools or restaurants).

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the text.
