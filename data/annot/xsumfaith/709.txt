Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "belfast giants" - The article does not mention the team as "belfast giants". Instead, it refers to them as "Manchester Storm". Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
2. "3-1" - The article does mention the score, but it's not a 3-1 defeat for the Belfast Giants. Instead, the score is 4-1 in favor of Manchester Storm. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
3. "belfast giants suffered a 3-1 defeat by manchester storm in sunday's elite league clash at the sse arena" - This sentence is not consistent with the article because it states that the Belfast Giants suffered a 3-1 defeat, which is not accurate according to the article. Additionally, the sentence mentions a "sunday's elite league clash", but the article does not mention the date of the game.
4. "sunday's elite league clash at the sse arena" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the game was not played on a Sunday. Instead, the game was played on a different day, as stated in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the phrases mentioned above.
