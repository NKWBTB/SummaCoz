 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "actor james" - The article does not mention James Nyong'o as an actor, only as a winner of a best supporting actress Oscar. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "oscar-winning actor james nyong \'o" - The article does not mention James Nyong'o as an actor, only as a winner of a best supporting actress Oscar. Additionally, the article does not mention the word "oscar-winning" to describe James Nyong'o. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. "in star wars: the force awakens" - The article does not mention James Nyong'o or any other actor starring in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
