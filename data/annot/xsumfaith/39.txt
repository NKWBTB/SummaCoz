Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that James Nyong'o is returning to star in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
2. However, the article states that Nyong'o played a CGI character named Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
3. The summary implies that Nyong'o is returning to star in the film, which is not consistent with the article, as she has already appeared in the film as a CGI character.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reason for this inconsistency is that the summary incorrectly states that Nyong'o is returning to star in the film, when in fact she has already appeared in the film as a CGI character.
