    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that James Nyong'o is returning to star in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but the article does not mention anything about him returning to the franchise. Instead, it mentions that he played a CGI character in the previous film, Maz Kanata.
2. The summary mentions that Jordan will be working with Nyong'o and Chadwick Boseman, but the article only mentions Nyong'o as someone Jordan is looking forward to working with.
3. The summary states that Jordan played the Human Torch in a Fantastic Four reboot, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits other information that is present in the article. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
