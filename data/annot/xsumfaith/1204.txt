<Article>
Mr Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time.
Specialist troops had been deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, police said.
Earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr Ruto's home.
"In circumstances that are yet unclear, he hit an officer on duty with a machete and managed to enter the farm complex," National Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said in a statement.
There were also reports of gunfire. The wounded police officer was in a stable condition, police said.
The incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative and regional elections.
The deputy president had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in the town of Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Mr Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month.
While Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left more than 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes.
However, experts say they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Mr. Ruto and his family were not at the compound near Eldoret at the time of the incident, which contradicts the summary that says a Kenyan man was shot dead during an election rally in Nairobi.
2. The article mentions that specialist troops were deployed to deal with an intruder who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, which suggests that the incident was not related to an election rally.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the identity of the person who was shot dead, whereas the article clearly states that the person who was injured was a police officer.
4. The article mentions that the incident occurred 10 days before the Kenyan elections, but the summary does not provide any context or information about the elections.

Therefore, based on the above points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is incomplete, inaccurate, and lacks context, which suggests that it may not be a reliable representation of the original article.
