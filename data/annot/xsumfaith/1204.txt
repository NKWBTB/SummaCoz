    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a kenyan man has been shot dead during an election rally in the capital nairobi, police say. 

    Article: 
    Mr Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time.
Specialist troops had been deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, police said.
Earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr Ruto's home.
"In circumstances that are yet unclear, he hit an officer on duty with a machete and managed to enter the farm complex," National Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said in a statement.
There were also reports of gunfire. The wounded police officer was in a stable condition, police said.
The incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative and regional elections.
The deputy president had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in the town of Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Mr Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month.
While Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left more than 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes.
However, experts say they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a Kenyan man was shot dead during an election rally in Nairobi, but the article does not mention any election rally or shooting incident in Nairobi.
2. The article mentions that Mr. Ruto and his family were not at their compound near Eldoret when the incident occurred, and there were no reports of gunmen entering his home.
3. The summary mentions a police officer being wounded, but the article does not mention any police officers being injured.
4. The article states that specialist troops were deployed to deal with an intruder who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, but the summary does not mention any intruder or building.
5. The article mentions that the incident occurred 10 days before Kenya's upcoming elections, but the summary does not mention any election-related context.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary appears to be a separate, unrelated incident or a completely fabricated story.
