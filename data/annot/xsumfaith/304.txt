    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistency
The inconsistency is that the summary states that Gateshead has signed defender Paul Cooper on a two-year deal, while the article states that Paul Cooper has rejoined Forest Green Rovers, not Gateshead.

Step 2: Analyze the article
The article states that Paul Cooper rejoined Forest Green Rovers in July 2016 and was ever-present as they won promotion to League Two last season. It also mentions that he made 144 appearances in his first spell with the club before spending the 2015-16 season with Gateshead.

Step 3: Analyze the summary
The summary states that Gateshead has signed defender Paul Cooper on a two-year deal following his release by Gateshead. This is inconsistent with the article, which states that Paul Cooper has rejoined Forest Green Rovers, not Gateshead.

Step 4: Identify the cause of the inconsistency
The cause of the inconsistency is that the summary has incorrect information about Paul Cooper's current club. The article states that he has rejoined Forest Green Rovers, but the summary states that he has signed with Gateshead.

Step 5: Correct the inconsistency
To correct the inconsistency, the summary should be revised to reflect the correct information that Paul Cooper has rejoined Forest Green Rovers, not Gateshead.
