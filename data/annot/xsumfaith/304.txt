Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Paul Cooper rejoined New Lawn side in July 2016, which implies that he was previously with the club and left before returning.
2. The summary states that Paul Cooper has signed with national league side Gateshead, which is a different team from the one he rejoined in the article.
3. The article mentions that Cooper made 144 appearances in his first spell with the club before spending the 2015-16 season with Gateshead, which suggests that he has experience with the club.
4. The summary states that Cooper was released by national league rivals Gateshead, which is not consistent with the article's statement that he spent the 2015-16 season with Gateshead.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Cooper was released by Gateshead, which is not supported by the information in the article.
