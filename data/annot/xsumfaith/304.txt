</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Paul Cooper has signed for Gateshead, a National League side, on a two-year deal.
2. The article states that Paul Cooper previously played for Gateshead on loan during the 2015-16 season.
3. However, the article also states that Cooper rejoined his current club, New Lawn, in July 2016 and was ever-present as they won promotion to League Two last season.
4. Therefore, it is inconsistent for the summary to state that Cooper has signed for Gateshead, as he is already playing for New Lawn.
5. Additionally, the article does not mention anything about Cooper leaving New Lawn or signing for Gateshead, so the summary is not supported by the article.
