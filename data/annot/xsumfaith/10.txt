    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Kevin Duffy has been appointed as the new head coach of Castleford Tigers.
2. However, the article states that Duffy has joined Featherstone on a one-year contract, not Castleford Tigers.
3. The article also states that Duffy will lead Featherstone in their final league game against Toulouse on Saturday before the upcoming Super 8 Qualifiers, which suggests that he is not the head coach of Castleford Tigers.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Duffy is the new head coach of Castleford Tigers, while the article states that he is the new head coach of Featherstone.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Kevin Duffy is the new head coach of Castleford Tigers, when in fact he is the new head coach of Featherstone.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Kevin Duffy has been appointed as the new head coach of Castleford Tigers.
2. However, the article states that Duffy has joined Featherstone on a one-year contract, not Castleford Tigers.
3. The article also states that Duffy will lead Featherstone in their final league game against Toulouse on Saturday before the upcoming Super 8 Qualifiers, which suggests that he is not the head coach of Castleford Tigers.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Duffy is the new head coach of Castleford Tigers, while the article states that he is the new head coach of Featherstone.
5. The summary uses the name of Kevin Duffy. However, the article does not mention Duffy's first name.
