The Seasiders struck with the first real chance after 12 minutes as Nathan Delfouneso jinked past his man and delivered a pinpoint chip into the area, where Jamille Matt turned the ball home from three yards.
Blackpool goalkeeper Sam Slocombe denied Matthew Briggs with a sensational save to push the ball behind after 17 minutes, but the visitors did equalise from the resulting corner as Kurtis Guthrie prodded in from close range after a goalmouth scramble.
Somehow, Colchester failed to re-take the lead on the stroke of half-time as Slocombe produced a brilliant save from George Elokobi's close-range effort, before Guthrie headed against the bar from two yards.
Blackpool should have clinched the win 15 minutes from time, as Tom Aldred was found unmarked from a corner, but he headed wide from eight yards.
Colchester finished the game with 10 men, after substitute Sean Murray was shown a straight red for a bad tackle on Jim McAlister in injury time.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the game ended in a draw, with Blackpool and Colchester United scoring one goal each.
2. The summary states that Sean Long scored an injury-time equaliser for Blackpool, implying that the team scored the equalising goal in the injury time.
3. However, the article does not mention anything about Sean Long scoring an equaliser in injury time. Instead, it states that Colchester United equalised from a corner kick in the 17th minute, and Blackpool had several other chances to score but failed.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Sean Long scoring an equaliser in injury time.

Conclusion:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Sean Long scoring an injury-time equaliser, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention any equalising goal in injury time, and instead focuses on Blackpool's failed chances to score and Colchester United's equalising goal from a corner kick.
