<Article>
The move was announced by Stormont's Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) Minister Arlene Foster.
She said Northern Ireland's agri-food industry was "hugely important", with almost 100,000 jobs including farming, fishing, retail and distribution.
The marketing body will be developed by the Agri-Food Strategy Board (AFSB).
Ms Foster said: "The establishment of a new industry-led agri-food marketing body, which would be similar to the already successful Scotland Food and Drink, will provide a significant and exciting opportunity for the Northern Ireland agri-food industry to work together for the benefit of the entire sector.
"This body will play a pivotal role in providing strategic leadership and direction for the marketing activities of both government and private sector organisations."
Stormont's Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill welcomed the announcement.
"Agri-food is one of the key sectors in delivering export-led economic growth for the north," she said.
She said industry representatives had made it clear that there was "a need for better coordination of current marketing activities" in Northern Ireland.
However, Ms O'Neill added that while the new body was "clearly a positive step", the plans could have "implications for the work of other organisations", including her own department.
She said she looked forward to discussing the plans with AFSB.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the announcement was made by Stormont's Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) Minister Arlene Foster, not the "first minister" of Northern Ireland.
2. The article does not mention the creation of a new body, only the development of a marketing body by the Agri-Food Strategy Board (AFSB).
3. The summary incorrectly states that the new body will be in Northern Ireland, when in fact the article states that the marketing body will be developed by the AFSB.

Therefore, the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

* "first" (should be "Enterprise, Trade and Investment" or "DETI")
* "new body" (should be "marketing body" or "Agri-Food Strategy Board")

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article.
