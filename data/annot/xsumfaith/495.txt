Santner, 24, broke his finger in only his second game for the county in 2016.
"There is some unfinished business with Mitch," director of cricket Steve Rhodes told Worcestershire's website.
"Last summer he was very unlucky. Losing Mitch was a massive blow to our hopes of qualifying. We'd had a good start and him playing all those games would have been an extra bonus for us."
The left-arm batsman and spinner, who made his Test debut in 2015, will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England.
Santner added: "I really enjoyed my time at Worcester with a great bunch of lads and it was so frustrating for me to pick up that injury in the very first T20 game.
"It's fantastic that I've got the chance to come back again next summer and hopefully I can make up for lost time and make an impact with bat and ball."
In August, Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game.

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game.
2. The summary states that Worcestershire have signed New Zealand all-rounder Colin Munro for the 2016 T20 Blast campaign.
3. The article does not mention Colin Munro or any New Zealand player.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Worcestershire have signed Colin Munro for the 2016 T20 Blast campaign is not supported by the article.
5. Additionally, the phrase "New Zealand all-rounder" is also not consistent with the article, as the article only mentions Australia pace bowler John Hastings.
6. Therefore, the two spans in the summary that have consistency issues are:

"worcestershire have signed new zealand all-rounder colin munro for the 2016 t20 blast campaign"

"new zealand all-rounder colin munro for the 2016 t20 blast campaign"

7. These two statements are not supported by the article and are therefore inconsistent with the rest of the text.
