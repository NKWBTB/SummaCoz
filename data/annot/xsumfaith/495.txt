    Summary: 
    worcestershire have signed new zealand all-rounder colin munro for the 2016 t20 blast campaign. 

    Article: 
    Santner, 24, broke his finger in only his second game for the county in 2016.
"There is some unfinished business with Mitch," director of cricket Steve Rhodes told Worcestershire's website.
"Last summer he was very unlucky. Losing Mitch was a massive blow to our hopes of qualifying. We'd had a good start and him playing all those games would have been an extra bonus for us."
The left-arm batsman and spinner, who made his Test debut in 2015, will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England.
Santner added: "I really enjoyed my time at Worcester with a great bunch of lads and it was so frustrating for me to pick up that injury in the very first T20 game.
"It's fantastic that I've got the chance to come back again next summer and hopefully I can make up for lost time and make an impact with bat and ball."
In August, Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game.

     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the key points in the summary and the article.

Summary:

* Worcestershire have signed Colin Munro for the 2016 T20 Blast campaign.

Article:

* Worcestershire have signed Mitchell Santner for the 2017 season across all formats of the game.

Step 2: Identify the inconsistency.

The inconsistency is that the summary mentions Colin Munro, but the article mentions Mitchell Santner.

Step 3: Explain why the inconsistency exists.

The inconsistency exists because the summary is referring to the 2016 T20 Blast campaign, while the article is referring to the 2017 season across all formats of the game. Therefore, the information in the summary is not consistent with the information in the article.

Step 4: Provide evidence from the article to support the inconsistency.

The article states, "In August, Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game." This evidence supports the inconsistency, as it shows that the article is referring to the 2017 season, while the summary is referring to the 2016 T20 Blast campaign.

Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the given summary is not consistent with the article.
