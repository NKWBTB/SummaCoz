    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistency

The summary states that the father of a 12-year-old boy who went missing in Ohio has been arrested, but the article states that the boy is now 18 years old and has been living with his father in Cleveland. This is an inconsistency between the two sources.

Step 2: Analyze the summary

The summary only provides information about the father being arrested and does not provide any information about the boy's age or whereabouts. This is a red flag that the summary may not be accurate or consistent with the article.

Step 3: Analyze the article

According to the article, the boy, Julian Hernandez, disappeared when he was five years old and is now 18 years old. He was found living with his father in Cleveland, and his father, Bobby Hernandez, was arrested and charged with tampering with records in Ohio. This information is not present in the summary.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistency

The inconsistency between the summary and the article is that the summary states that the father of a 12-year-old boy who went missing in Ohio has been arrested, while the article states that the boy is now 18 years old and has been living with his father in Cleveland. The summary does not provide any information about the boy's age or whereabouts, which is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is likely that the summary is inaccurate or incomplete.
