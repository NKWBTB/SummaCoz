</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the father of a 12-year-old boy who went missing in Ohio has been arrested.
2. However, the article states that the boy, Julian Hernandez, disappeared when he was five and is now 18, living with his father in Cleveland.
3. This implies that the father, Bobby Hernandez, was arrested for something related to the disappearance of his son, but the summary does not mention this.
4. Instead, the summary only states that the father was arrested in Ohio, without providing any information about the reason for his arrest.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately convey the information about the father's arrest and the reason for it.
