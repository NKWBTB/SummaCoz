The boy, Julian Hernandez, disappeared when he was five and is now 18, living with his father in Cleveland.
Bobby Hernandez, 53, was arrested and is being held at a jail in Ohio.
The FBI received a tip on 30 October that this teenager may be the long-missing child after problems he had applying for college.
The agency worked with Alabama police and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to confirm the boy's identity.
His mother has been notified of his recovery, AL.com reports.
His father is also charged with tampering with records in Ohio so he could obtain a driver's licence in 2012.
He is being held at the Cuyahoga County Jail in Ohio with a $250,000 (Â£164,100) bail.
Authorities suspected around the time of the boy's disappearance that his father was possibly the culprit, according to AL.com.
A missing persons database shows that Mr Hernandez said he was taking his son to pre-school in August 2002 but then fled.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the boy, Julian Hernandez, disappeared when he was five years old, not 12.
2. The summary incorrectly states that the father was arrested in Ohio, while the article states that he was arrested in Alabama.
3. The summary mentions that the boy went missing in Ohio, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the boy was last seen in August 2002 when his father said he was taking him to pre-school, but then fled.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the father is also charged with tampering with records in Ohio so he could obtain a driver's license in 2012.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, including the age of the boy, the location of the arrest, and the details of the father's charges.
