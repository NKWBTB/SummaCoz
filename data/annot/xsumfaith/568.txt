<Article>
Thirty-six whales were rescued and pushed back into the sea at Tuticorin on Tuesday, but 28 of them floated back to the shore and died on Wednesday.
Earlier, 45 whales died after 81 of the animals were stranded on Monday.
The last time such an incident occurred in Tuticorin was in 1973 when 147 whales died.
Local fishermen, helped by officials, have been using mechanised boats to float the stranded whales back into the sea, but many of the animals have returned to the shore, BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi reports.
"This is a well known phenomenon. When there is mass stranding, whales return ashore. Pilot whales are very social animals and they live in groups. They are very aware that some of their group members are in distress on the shore, possibly dead, so they don't wish to go back into the sea," whale expert Dr Kumaran Sathasivam said.
The dead whales are being buried near the shore at Tuticorin, officials say.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "has risen to 73",
  "short-finned",
  "indian state of tamil nadu"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "has risen to 73": The article states that 28 whales floated back to the shore and died on Wednesday, but the summary states that the number of dead whales has risen to 73. This is inconsistent because the article does not mention the number 73.
2. "short-finned": The article does not mention the type of whales that were stranded. The summary states that the whales were short-finned pilot whales, but this is not supported by the article.
3. "indian state of tamil nadu": The article does not mention the state of Tamil Nadu. The summary states that the stranding occurred in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, but this is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues with the following spans:

* "has risen to 73"
* "short-finned"
* "indian state of tamil nadu"

These inconsistencies suggest that the summary may not accurately reflect the content of the article.
