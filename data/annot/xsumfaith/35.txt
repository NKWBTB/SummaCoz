    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    work has begun on a permanent memorial to the victims of the police attack in westminster. 

    Article: 
    PC Keith Palmer's murder, in an attack outside the Houses of Parliament in March, prompted "greater emphasis" on the need for a permanent memorial.
The UK Police Memorial Trust appealed for £1.5m towards its construction at the National Memorial Arboretum.
It is set to bear the names of more than 1,400 officers and staff.
Sir Hugh Orde, chairman of the trust, said: "PC Palmer's death has put greater emphasis on the need to create a place where the nation can honour and commemorate our police service and where family, friends and colleagues of those killed on duty can go to carry out personal acts of remembrance.
"We need to establish a fitting memorial that recognises the vital contribution that policing makes to our society and acknowledges the courage and sacrifice made by police officers and police staff who have paid the ultimate price.
"That tribute must become part of the fabric of our national life."

The memorial, at the site in Alrewas, Staffordshire, will be dedicated to the courage and sacrifice of the officers, who have lost their lives over the past 250 years.
A brass screen will have leaf shapes cut out and given to the families of fallen officers, with the names of loved ones as a personal memorial.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the government had committed £1m towards the £4m needed for it.
"It is entirely fitting that those officers and staff who give their lives in the line of duty should be remembered with a lasting tribute," she said.
The memorial is expected to be completed by 2019. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that work has begun on a permanent memorial to the victims of the police attack in Westminster. However, the article does not mention any memorial to the victims of the Westminster attack. Instead, the article discusses a memorial to honor police officers and staff who have lost their lives over the past 250 years.

2. The summary does not mention anything about the location of the memorial, but the article states that the memorial will be built at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire.

3. The summary mentions nothing about the design of the memorial, but the article explains that the memorial will feature a brass screen with leaf shapes cut out, which will be given to the families of fallen officers as a personal memorial.

4. The summary does not mention Amber Rudd or the government's commitment to the memorial, but the article states that the government has committed £1 million towards the £4 million needed for the memorial.

5. Finally, the summary does not mention the expected completion date of the memorial, but the article states that the memorial is expected to be completed by 2019.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary mentions a memorial to the victims of the Westminster attack, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary does not mention the location, design, or government commitment to the memorial, all of which are discussed in the article.
