PC Keith Palmer's murder, in an attack outside the Houses of Parliament in March, prompted "greater emphasis" on the need for a permanent memorial.
The UK Police Memorial Trust appealed for £1.5m towards its construction at the National Memorial Arboretum.
It is set to bear the names of more than 1,400 officers and staff.
Sir Hugh Orde, chairman of the trust, said: "PC Palmer's death has put greater emphasis on the need to create a place where the nation can honour and commemorate our police service and where family, friends and colleagues of those killed on duty can go to carry out personal acts of remembrance.
"We need to establish a fitting memorial that recognises the vital contribution that policing makes to our society and acknowledges the courage and sacrifice made by police officers and police staff who have paid the ultimate price.
"That tribute must become part of the fabric of our national life."

The memorial, at the site in Alrewas, Staffordshire, will be dedicated to the courage and sacrifice of the officers, who have lost their lives over the past 250 years.
A brass screen will have leaf shapes cut out and given to the families of fallen officers, with the names of loved ones as a personal memorial.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the government had committed £1m towards the £4m needed for it.
"It is entirely fitting that those officers and staff who give their lives in the line of duty should be remembered with a lasting tribute," she said.
The memorial is expected to be completed by 2019.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "police attack in westminster"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I can help you identify the consistency issues in the summary. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions "PC Keith Palmer's murder" and the need for a permanent memorial, but it does not mention any "police attack in Westminster."
2. The summary states that work has begun on a permanent memorial to the victims of the "police attack in Westminster." This implies that there was a specific attack on police officers in Westminster, which is not mentioned in the article.
3. The article only mentions the murder of PC Keith Palmer outside the Houses of Parliament in March, and does not mention any other attacks on police officers in Westminster.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies the existence of a police attack in Westminster, which is not supported by the information in the article.

So, the inconsistency issue in the summary is the mention of a "police attack in Westminster," which is not present in the article.
