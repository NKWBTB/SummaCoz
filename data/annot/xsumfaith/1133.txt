    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    police investigating the murder of a man found dead at his home in cambridgeshire have issued a cctv appeal. 

    Article: 
    The body of the man in his 70s, was found at the house in Nettleden Road, Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, on Saturday afternoon.
A man in his 80s was also taken to hospital, a police spokeswoman said.
Detectives want to question 55-year-old Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, and have warned people not to approach him.
Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit, said: "The investigation is still in its early stages.
"However, we are continuing to treat the death as murder. We urgently want to speak to Ian McLoughlin in connection with this offence."
He is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall, with straight, greying, collar-length hair and of average build.
He is believed to have been wearing sunglasses, blue jeans or three-quarter length trousers and a dark blue, light blue and white checked short-sleeved shirt with a button-down collar.
Anyone with information has been urged to contact police or Crimestoppers.
Officers have been conducting additional patrols in the area to provide reassurance to residents. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that police have issued a CCTV appeal, but the article does not mention anything about a CCTV appeal.
2. The summary mentions the man found dead was in his 70s, but the article states he was in his 80s.
3. The summary mentions the police want to question a 55-year-old man named Ian John McLoughlin, but the article does not mention this name or any specific suspect.
4. The summary mentions the investigation is still in its early stages, but the article states it is being treated as murder and the police are urgently seeking to speak to Ian McLoughlin.

Therefore, based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that police have issued a CCTV appeal, but the article does not mention anything about a CCTV appeal.
2. The summary states a man found dead at his home in cambridgeshire. However, the article states that the body of a man was found at the house in Nettleden Road, Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted. The article does not mention the location of the body is in cambridgeshire.
