The event takes place from 4-13 August and there will be live coverage across the BBC.
Medals at July's World Para Athletics Championships, taking place from 14-23 July, will be similar, but feature distinctive disability sport equipment such as a prosthetic running leg and throwing chair.
Rather than engraving, the reverse will be inscribed with braille.
For the first time at the World Championships, 'coaches medals' will also be handed out to recognise those who prepare athletes.

  "friday, 3 august, for the first time",
  "first time",
  "the world para athletics championships are taking place in london on friday, 3 august, for the first time",
  "friday, 3 august"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "friday, 3 august, for the first time" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the article states that the event takes place from 4-13 August, not on a specific date like Friday, 3 August.
2. "first time" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention that this is the first time the event is taking place.
3. "the world para athletics championships are taking place in london on friday, 3 august, for the first time" - This sentence is a combination of accurate and inaccurate information. The event is taking place in London, but it is not on a specific date like Friday, 3 August, and it is not the first time the event is taking place.
4. "friday, 3 august" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the event does not take place on a specific date like Friday, 3 August.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides inaccurate information about the date and timing of the event, and it also includes phrases that are not supported by the article.
