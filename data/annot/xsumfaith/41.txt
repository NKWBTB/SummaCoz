</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that David Sullivan and David Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010, valuing the club at £105m.
2. The article also mentions that between them, they now own more than 85% of the club.
3. The summary denies reports that Sullivan and his family are in talks to buy the club from West Ham United.

The inconsistency between the article and the summary is that the article states that Sullivan and Gold already own a majority stake in the club, while the summary suggests that they are not in talks to buy the club.

Therefore, the reason for the inconsistency is that the summary is not accurate in denying reports of a takeover, as the article states that Sullivan and Gold already own a majority stake in the club.
