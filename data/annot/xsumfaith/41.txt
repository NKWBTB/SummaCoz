    Summary: 
    david sullivan and david gold have denied reports that he and his family are in talks to buy the club from west ham united. 

    Article: 
    It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club.
Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.
Between them they now own more than 85% of the club.
Since August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
Last year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that David Sullivan and David Gold have denied reports that they and their family are in talks to buy the club from West Ham United.
2. However, the article does not mention any such reports or denials. Instead, it discusses the possibility of the club being sold to energy drinks giant, Red Bull.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of any talks or denials of such talks in the article.
4. The article does mention that Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 and now own more than 85% of the club, but there is no mention of any plans to sell the club or any talks with Red Bull.
5. Based on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is incorrect and there is no basis for the claim that Sullivan and Gold have denied reports of talks to buy the club.
