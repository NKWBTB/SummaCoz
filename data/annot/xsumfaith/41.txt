It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club.
Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.
Between them they now own more than 85% of the club.
Since August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
Last year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that David Sullivan and David Gold own a majority stake in West Ham United, with over 85% ownership between them.
2. The summary states that David Sullivan and David Gold have denied reports that they are in talks to buy the club from West Ham United.

Consistency issue:
The article states that David Sullivan and David Gold already own a majority stake in the club, so it is inconsistent for them to be denying reports that they are in talks to buy the club.

1. The article mentions that West Ham United moved to London Stadium in August, and since then, the club has been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
2. The summary does not mention anything about these takeover attempts.

Consistency issue:
The article provides information about potential takeovers of the club, but the summary does not include this information.

1. The article states that David Sullivan and David Gold have said that they intend to pass on ownership of the club to their children.
2. The summary does not mention this information.

Consistency issue:
The article provides information about the long-term plans of the current owners, but the summary does not include this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include important details about the club's ownership and potential takeovers, and it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
