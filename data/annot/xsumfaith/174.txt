It would make the disused Fawley power station chimney the tallest such attraction south of London's Shard.
Developers Fawley Waterside said it would be the centrepiece of a "merchant city" development.
The power station closed in 2013 after more than 40 years in operation.
Architects plans show a petal-shaped glass structure at the centre of a Â£1bn development featuring a marina, housing and restaurants.
It also includes fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth.
With an application for outline planning permission due later this year, building could start in 2018.
The oil-fired Fawley Power Station, on the western side of Southampton Water, was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes.
The 300-acre site was sold to Fawley Waterside developers in 2016.
Aldred Drummond of the company said: "We'd be mad to knock the chimney down - its our signature piece of infrastructure.
"If you think of the money spent building the i360 in Brighton, or the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, this building is already there so with relatively little investment we can do something very spectacular."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the power station closed in 2013, but the summary states that plans have been submitted for a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront, which implies that the power station is still in operation.
2. The article mentions that the power station was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes, but the summary does not mention any of these details.
3. The article states that the 300-acre site was sold to Fawley Waterside developers in 2016, but the summary does not mention this information.
4. The article mentions that the developers plan to build a "merchant city" development featuring a marina, housing, and restaurants, but the summary only mentions a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the power station, such as its closure date, capacity, and the fact that it is no longer in operation. Additionally, the summary only mentions a glass tower, whereas the article mentions a larger development plan.
