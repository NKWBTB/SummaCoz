It would make the disused Fawley power station chimney the tallest such attraction south of London's Shard.
Developers Fawley Waterside said it would be the centrepiece of a "merchant city" development.
The power station closed in 2013 after more than 40 years in operation.
Architects plans show a petal-shaped glass structure at the centre of a Â£1bn development featuring a marina, housing and restaurants.
It also includes fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth.
With an application for outline planning permission due later this year, building could start in 2018.
The oil-fired Fawley Power Station, on the western side of Southampton Water, was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes.
The 300-acre site was sold to Fawley Waterside developers in 2016.
Aldred Drummond of the company said: "We'd be mad to knock the chimney down - its our signature piece of infrastructure.
"If you think of the money spent building the i360 in Brighton, or the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, this building is already there so with relatively little investment we can do something very spectacular."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "tower",
  "edge"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "tower": The article mentions a "petal-shaped glass structure" but not a "tower". The summary is inconsistent with the article because it only mentions a "tower".
2. "edge": The article does not mention anything about the power station being located on the "edge" of Southampton seafront. The summary is inconsistent with the article because it implies that the power station is located on the edge of the seafront, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two inaccuracies: it only mentions a "tower" instead of a "petal-shaped glass structure", and it implies that the power station is located on the edge of the seafront, which is not supported by the article.
