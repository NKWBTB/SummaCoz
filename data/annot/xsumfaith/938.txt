It would make the disused Fawley power station chimney the tallest such attraction south of London's Shard.
Developers Fawley Waterside said it would be the centrepiece of a "merchant city" development.
The power station closed in 2013 after more than 40 years in operation.
Architects plans show a petal-shaped glass structure at the centre of a Â£1bn development featuring a marina, housing and restaurants.
It also includes fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth.
With an application for outline planning permission due later this year, building could start in 2018.
The oil-fired Fawley Power Station, on the western side of Southampton Water, was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes.
The 300-acre site was sold to Fawley Waterside developers in 2016.
Aldred Drummond of the company said: "We'd be mad to knock the chimney down - its our signature piece of infrastructure.
"If you think of the money spent building the i360 in Brighton, or the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, this building is already there so with relatively little investment we can do something very spectacular."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Fawley power station is located on the western side of Southampton Water, and that it was commissioned in 1971.
2. The summary states that construction work has started on a new power station in Brighton. This is inconsistent with the article, as Brighton is not mentioned in the article as the location of the Fawley power station.
3. The article does not mention anything about building a new power station in Brighton. Instead, it focuses on the redevelopment of the Fawley power station site into a "merchant city" with a marina, housing, and restaurants.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that construction work has started on a new power station in Brighton is not supported by the article.

Overall, the inconsistency in the summary is due to the fact that it refers to a new power station being built in Brighton, while the article only discusses the redevelopment of the Fawley power station site in Southampton.
