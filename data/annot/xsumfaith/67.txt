<Article>
Paramedics were called to attend a sudden death at Joe's Bar in Dungiven at 06:00 BST on 6 October 2014, Limavady Magistrates Court was told.
Police arriving a short time later found several people still at the bar.
Till receipts showed alcohol was being served as late as 04:49 BST. The judge ordered its closure for three months.
Colleen O'Neill, 43, of Kevin Lynch Park in the town, was charged with two counts of allowing the consumption of liquor outside licensing hours.
James Thomas, 44, of the same address, faced one count of the same charge.
A defence solicitor told the court that the licensing laws in Dungiven "were not strictly adhered to".
He said it was clear that the premises had not been run in a proper manner and had been running well into the morning.
The judge said Ms O'Neill, who is the license holder, had "an appalling record" and expressed concern that he did not have power to impose a custodial sentence.
"This was as bad a case as I have come across and as bad a record," he said.
Ms O'Neill was also fined £3,000, while Mr Thomas was fined £1,000.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the bar was fined £2,000 after the death of its owner.
2. The article does not mention the death of the owner. Instead, it reports that paramedics were called to attend a sudden death at the bar, but does not provide any information about the identity of the deceased.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of the owner's death in the article.
4. The article does mention that the bar was ordered to be closed for three months, and that the license holder, Colleen O'Neill, was fined £3,000, while another person, James Thomas, was fined £1,000.
5. The summary does not provide any information about the closure of the bar or the fines imposed on the license holder and the other person.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions the death of the owner, which is not present in the article. The article provides information about the bar being ordered to be closed for three months and the fines imposed on the license holder and another person, but the summary does not include this information.
