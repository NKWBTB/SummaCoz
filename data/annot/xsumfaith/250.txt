<Article>
The charge follows the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1.
City had forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho sent off, but Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action.
City manager Pep Guardiola apologised for his team's part in the incident.
Aguero, 28, received a four-match ban for what was his second dismissal for violent conduct this season, following a high and late challenge on Chelsea defender David Luiz.
Fernandinho clashed with Fabregas in the scuffle that followed Aguero's challenge, and the Brazil midfielder will serve a three-match ban.
Both clubs have until 18:00 GMT on 8 December to respond to the charge.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Manchester City have been charged by the Football Association for the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1.
2. The article specifically mentions that the charge is for the incident involving Sergio Aguero and David Luiz, and that Aguero has been given a four-match ban and Fernandinho has been given a three-match ban.
3. However, the summary states that Manchester City have been charged for "failing to control their players at the Etihad Stadium". This is not consistent with the article, as the charge is specific to the incident involving Aguero and Luiz, and not a general charge for failing to control players.
4. Additionally, the summary incorrectly states "manchester city" instead of "Manchester City". This is a minor inconsistency, but it does indicate a lack of attention to detail in the summary.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misstates the reason for the charge and contains a minor inconsistency in the spelling of the team name.
