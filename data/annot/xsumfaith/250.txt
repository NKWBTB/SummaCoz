    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Manchester City has been charged by the Football Association for failing to control their players at the Etihad Stadium.
2. However, the article states that the charge is due to the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1.
3. The article mentions that City had forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho sent off, but Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the specific incidents that led to the charges, only that Manchester City has been charged for failing to control their players.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any information about the specific incidents that led to the charges, whereas the article provides detailed information about the incidents and the charges.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any information about the specific incidents that led to the charges, whereas the article provides detailed information about the incidents and the charges.
