    Summary: 
    cardiff blues suffered their first european challenge cup defeat of the season as gloucester came from behind to beat gloucester at kingsholm. 

    Article: 
    A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded.
Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.
But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win.
The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.
Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.
In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties.
More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up.
However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break.
Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.
England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the given summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the key points in the summary.

The summary mentions the following points:

* Cardiff Blues suffered their first European Challenge Cup defeat of the season.
* Gloucester came from behind to beat Cardiff Blues at Kingsholm.

Step 2: Identify the key points in the article.

The article mentions the following points:

* Cardiff Blues were leading the game at one point, but Gloucester came back to win.
* Gloucester's Jonny May, Tom Marshall, Mark Atkinson, and Henry Purdy scored tries in the second half.
* Cardiff Blues' Alex Cuthbert and Ross Moriarty traded tries in the first half.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies.

The summary states that Cardiff Blues suffered their first European Challenge Cup defeat of the season, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Cardiff Blues were leading the game at one point but lost in the end.

Additionally, the summary does not mention the names of the players who scored tries for Gloucester in the second half, such as Jonny May, Tom Marshall, Mark Atkinson, and Henry Purdy. These players are mentioned in the article, but not in the summary.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistencies.

The inconsistencies in the summary are likely due to a lack of attention to detail and a failure to accurately summarize the article. The summary focuses on the final result of the game (Gloucester winning) without providing a complete picture of the game's events.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the events of the game and omits important details, such as the names of the players who scored tries for Gloucester in the second half.
