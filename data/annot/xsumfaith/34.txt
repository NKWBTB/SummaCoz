The Seasiders struck with the first real chance after 12 minutes as Nathan Delfouneso jinked past his man and delivered a pinpoint chip into the area, where Jamille Matt turned the ball home from three yards.
Blackpool goalkeeper Sam Slocombe denied Matthew Briggs with a sensational save to push the ball behind after 17 minutes, but the visitors did equalise from the resulting corner as Kurtis Guthrie prodded in from close range after a goalmouth scramble.
Somehow, Colchester failed to re-take the lead on the stroke of half-time as Slocombe produced a brilliant save from George Elokobi's close-range effort, before Guthrie headed against the bar from two yards.
Blackpool should have clinched the win 15 minutes from time, as Tom Aldred was found unmarked from a corner, but he headed wide from eight yards.
Colchester finished the game with 10 men, after substitute Sean Murray was shown a straight red for a bad tackle on Jim McAlister in injury time.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "draw"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Blackpool and Colchester United played a match that ended in a draw, with the final score being 1-1.
2. The summary states that Colchester's unbeaten run came to an end, which implies that they did not win the match.
3. However, the article states that the match ended in a draw, which means that neither team won or lost.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Colchester's unbeaten run came to an end is not consistent with the article, as the match ended in a draw rather than a loss.

So, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary states that Colchester's unbeaten run came to an end, while the article states that the match ended in a draw.
