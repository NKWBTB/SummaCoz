    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a former labour councillor has denied possessing indecent images of a child. 

    Article: 
    Hull city councillor Steven Bayes also pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image when he appeared at the city's crown court.
The 55-year-old was suspended from the Labour Party in October after it "became aware of a police investigation into him", a party spokesman said.
He was released on unconditional bail and is due to stand trial on 5 February 2018 at the same court.
Mr Bayes was first elected as a councillor in 1985.
He was involved in Hull's bid to secure the UK City of Culture title and is a former vice chair of the Hull 2017 company, which is organising arts activities and events for the year-long celebration. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the former labour councillor denied possessing indecent images of a child.
2. However, the article states that the councillor, Steven Bayes, pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image.
3. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about indecent images of a child, but rather an extreme pornographic image.
4. Therefore, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the summary includes information that is not present in the article (indecent images of a child).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
