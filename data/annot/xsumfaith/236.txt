Hull city councillor Steven Bayes also pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image when he appeared at the city's crown court.
The 55-year-old was suspended from the Labour Party in October after it "became aware of a police investigation into him", a party spokesman said.
He was released on unconditional bail and is due to stand trial on 5 February 2018 at the same court.
Mr Bayes was first elected as a councillor in 1985.
He was involved in Hull's bid to secure the UK City of Culture title and is a former vice chair of the Hull 2017 company, which is organising arts activities and events for the year-long celebration.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the councillor, Steven Bayes, pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image, but the summary states that he denied possessing indecent images of a child. This is inconsistent because the article does not mention anything about child pornography.
2. The word "child" in the summary is not supported by the article. The article does not mention the word "child" at all.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the reference to "child" in the summary is not accurate and does not match the content of the article.

Overall, the summary is not a faithful representation of the article because it includes information that is not present in the article. It is important to ensure that summaries accurately reflect the content of the original article to maintain consistency and avoid misinformation.
