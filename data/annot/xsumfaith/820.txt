    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain the reasoning step by step. Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Number of participants: The summary mentions "thousands of people" taking part in the event, while the article states that "more than 20 competitors" are due to take part. The article does not mention thousands of participants.
2. Tool usage: The summary states that only chainsaws are allowed, which is correct. However, the article does not mention this detail.
3. Prize: The summary mentions the Claymore Trophy, which is correct. However, the article does not mention the prize.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as the number of participants and the tool usage. Additionally, it omits information that is present in the article, such as the prize.
