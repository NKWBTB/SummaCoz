</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "thousands",
  "scottish grand prix",
  "the first round",
  "first round of the scottish grand prix"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "thousands": The article states that "more than 20 competitors" will take part in the event, which is a far cry from "thousands" of people. The summary exaggerates the number of participants.
2. "scottish grand prix": The article does not mention anything about a "scottish grand prix". The event is simply referred to as a "competition" and a "carving contest".
3. "the first round": The article does not mention anything about "rounds" or a "tournament" structure. The competition is a one-time event.
4. "first round of the scottish grand prix": This phrase is a combination of the previous two inaccuracies. There is no "scottish grand prix" and there is only one round of the competition, not a "first round".

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the number of participants, misrepresents the nature of the event, and includes elements that are not mentioned in the article at all.
