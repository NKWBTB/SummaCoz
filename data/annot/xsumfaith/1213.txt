    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a major road has reopened in Bristol following a crash involving two commuters. However, the article states that the A36 road closure was lifted at 14:00 GMT, which contradicts the summary's claim that the road has reopened.
2. The article does not mention anything about the road reopening or the crash involving two commuters. Instead, it focuses on the disruption and delays caused by the road closure during rush hour and the investigation into how the collision happened.
3. The summary's claim that the road has reopened is not supported by the article, which indicates that the road is still closed as of 14:00 GMT.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reason for this inconsistency is that the summary contains information that is not supported by the article.
