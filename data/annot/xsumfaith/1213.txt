</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the A36 road was closed due to a crash, but the summary does not mention any crash.
2. The article mentions that the road was closed for 11 hours, from 03:00 GMT to 14:00 GMT, but the summary does not provide any information about the duration of the closure.
3. The article mentions that the collision is under investigation, but the summary does not provide any information about the cause of the closure.
4. The article mentions that First bus services were affected by the closure, but the summary does not provide any information about the impact on bus services.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any information about the crash, the duration of the closure, the cause of the closure, or the impact on bus services.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions a crash involving two commuters. However, the article does not mention anything about two commuters.
