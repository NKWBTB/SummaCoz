<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
Mr Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time.
Specialist troops had been deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, police said.
Earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr Ruto's home.
"In circumstances that are yet unclear, he hit an officer on duty with a machete and managed to enter the farm complex," National Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said in a statement.
There were also reports of gunfire. The wounded police officer was in a stable condition, police said.
The incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative and regional elections.
The deputy president had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in the town of Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Mr Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month.
While Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left more than 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes.
However, experts say they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "capital of the month of kenya\\'s parliament",
  "in the head of the capital of the month of kenya\\'s parliament"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident occurred in Eldoret, which is a town located in the western part of Kenya, and not in the capital city of Kenya.
2. The summary mentions that the incident occurred in the "capital of the month of Kenya's parliament", which is not accurate as there is no capital city of Kenya called "the month of Kenya's parliament".
3. The summary also mentions that the police officer was shot "in the head of the capital of the month of Kenya's parliament", which is not accurate as there is no such place as the "head of the capital of the month of Kenya's parliament".
4. The article does not mention anything about a police officer being shot or injured, let alone in the capital city of Kenya or in the "head" of such a place.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the spans highlighted in the question are the ones that have consistency issues.
