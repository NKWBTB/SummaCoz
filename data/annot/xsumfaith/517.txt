<Article>
Her Royal Highness took the baton at the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra's new home, the Elbphilharmonie concert hall.
It was part of an event where 250 schoolchildren were introduced to music in front of the Duke and Duchess.
The Royal party are due back in the UK on Friday evening, after a five-day tour that began in Poland on Monday.
On the last day of the tour, the Duchess, who comes from a musical family and played the flute at school, took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven's fifth symphony.
The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra.
Earlier, Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments, including a violin, flute, timpani [kettle drums] and trombone.
Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg.
Prince George tried on a pilot's helmet while Princess Charlotte played with buttons in the cockpit.
The Duke flew helicopters when he was an air ambulance pilot.
Antoine van Gent, head of flight testing at Airbus, said: "The Duke was very relaxed showing his children the professional aircraft he uses.
"George was excited, with the first helicopter he wanted to sit in the cockpit and then he wanted to sit in the next one, he already knew there was a difference between them."
Charlotte was less impressed after taking a tumble on the concrete after leaving the aircraft but Mr van Gent said she enjoyed playing in the pilot's seat.

[
  "cambridge tried her hand at conducting a prestigious",
  "germany"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Duchess of Cambridge played the flute at school, but the summary does not mention anything about the Duchess playing the flute.
2. The article states that the royal couple listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, but the summary does not mention anything about the symphony being adapted for young people.
3. The article states that the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg, but the summary does not mention anything about the Duke giving his children a tour of a helicopter.
4. The article states that the Duchess was introduced to music in front of the Duke and Duchess, but the summary does not mention anything about the Duke being present.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information in the article. The spans that have consistency issues are:

* "cambridge tried her hand at conducting a prestigious" - The Duchess did not conduct a symphony orchestra, she played the flute.
* "germany" - The article does not mention anything about the royal tour being in Germany.
