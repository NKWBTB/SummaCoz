    Summary: 
    worcestershire have re-signed south africa all-rounder mitch santner for this summer\'s t20 blast. 

    Article: 
    Santner, 24, broke his finger in only his second game for the county in 2016.
"There is some unfinished business with Mitch," director of cricket Steve Rhodes told Worcestershire's website.
"Last summer he was very unlucky. Losing Mitch was a massive blow to our hopes of qualifying. We'd had a good start and him playing all those games would have been an extra bonus for us."
The left-arm batsman and spinner, who made his Test debut in 2015, will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England.
Santner added: "I really enjoyed my time at Worcester with a great bunch of lads and it was so frustrating for me to pick up that injury in the very first T20 game.
"It's fantastic that I've got the chance to come back again next summer and hopefully I can make up for lost time and make an impact with bat and ball."
In August, Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Worcestershire have re-signed Mitch Santner for this summer's T20 Blast, but the article does not mention anything about re-signing him. Instead, it mentions that he broke his finger in only his second game for the county in 2016 and that he will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England.
2. The summary implies that Santner has been playing for Worcestershire for multiple summers, but the article states that he only played two games for the county in 2016 before breaking his finger.
3. The summary mentions nothing about Santner's injury or his return to the team, which are key points in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a fictional or made-up summary.
