    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a search is under way for a man who has been missing since last month. 

    Article: 
    Trevor Deely, 22, was last seen walking home from a Christmas party in December 2000.
A search of a site in Chapelizod in Dublin started early on Saturday morning, Irish national broadcaster, RTÉ reports.
The area is three acres of Woodlands beside the R112 which runs down to the River Liffey.
Gardaí said the search will involve excavations and is expected to take a number of weeks.
Earlier this year a team of six detectives began conducting a complete review of Mr Deely's disappearance.
CCTV footage from the night he went missing was enhanced using specialist technology.
It shows Mr Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street, where he worked.
It is understood he was returning to get an umbrella after the party.
Detectives released the footage in April and appealed for the man to come forward.
They believe he was the same man captured on CCTV following Mr Deely, who was from County Kildare in the Republic of Ireland, a short time later on Haddington Road.
On Saturday gardaí said the man seen in the CCTV has not yet been identified and they renewed their appeal for him to come forward. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a man has been missing since last month, but the article states that Trevor Deely went missing in December 2000, which is not last month.
2. The summary does not mention anything about a search for Trevor Deely, but the article states that a search of a site in Chapelizod in Dublin started early on Saturday morning.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the search involving excavations, but the article states that the search will involve excavations and is expected to take a number of weeks.
4. The summary does not mention anything about detectives conducting a complete review of Mr. Deely's disappearance, but the article states that earlier this year, a team of six detectives began conducting a complete review of Mr. Deely's disappearance.
5. The summary does not mention anything about CCTV footage being enhanced using specialist technology, but the article states that CCTV footage from the night Mr. Deely went missing was enhanced using specialist technology.
6. The summary does not mention anything about detectives releasing the footage in April and appealing for the man to come forward, but the article states that detectives released the footage in April and renewed their appeal for the man to come forward.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a man has been missing since last month, but the article states that Trevor Deely went missing in December 2000, which is not last month.
