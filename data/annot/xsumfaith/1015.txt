<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the london athletics world athletics championships will be held in london this summer. 

    Article: 
    Symbols of every event feature on the design, while the London skyline is included with Tower Bridge, the London Eye, the Shard and Big Ben.
The reverse features London Stadium, the championships' venue.
The event takes place from 4-13 August and there will be live coverage across the BBC.
Medals at July's World Para Athletics Championships, taking place from 14-23 July, will be similar, but feature distinctive disability sport equipment such as a prosthetic running leg and throwing chair.
Rather than engraving, the reverse will be inscribed with braille.
For the first time at the World Championships, 'coaches medals' will also be handed out to recognise those who prepare athletes. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the London Athletics World Athletic Championships will be held in London this summer, which is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention the London Athletics World Athletic Championships.
2. The article mentions the World Para Athletics Championships, which will take place from July 14-23, but the summary does not mention this event.
3. The article mentions that medals at the World Para Athletics Championships will feature distinctive disability sport equipment such as a prosthetic running leg and throwing chair, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that the reverse of the medals will be inscribed with braille, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article mentions that 'coaches medals' will be handed out for the first time at the World Championships, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information mentioned in the article, and it includes information that is not present in the article (the London Athletics World Athletic Championships).
