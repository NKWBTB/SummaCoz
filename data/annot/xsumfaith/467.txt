    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that tributes have been paid to William McIlvanney, who has died at the age of 87. However, the article does not mention anything about McIlvanney's death.
2. The article discusses the council's plan to name a new campus in Kilmarnock after McIlvanney, but the summary does not mention anything about a campus or a new building.
3. The article mentions that McIlvanney was born and educated in Kilmarnock, but the summary does not provide any information about his background or where he was from.
4. The article highlights McIlvanney's career as a writer and his contributions to Scottish literature, but the summary does not mention anything about his writing or his achievements in the field.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about William McIlvanney's death, the council's plan to name a campus after him, or his background and achievements as a writer.
