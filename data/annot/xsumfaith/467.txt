[
  "tributes have been paid to scottish writer william mcilvanney, who has died at the age of 87"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the council is planning to name a new campus in Kilmarnock after William McIlvanney.
2. The summary states that William McIlvanney has died at the age of 87.
3. The problem here is that the summary mentions McIlvanney's death, but the article does not. The article only mentions the council's plan to name the campus after him.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article. Specifically, it mentions McIlvanney's death, which is not mentioned in the article.

So, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary includes information that is not supported by the article.
