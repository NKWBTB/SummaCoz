    He told The Hollywood Reporter he was "super excited" and wanted "to put a different spin on it", but did not expand on what role he would play.
The film will see Jordan reunite with his Creed director Ryan Coogler.
"I'm looking forward to working with Ryan once again. It's gonna be a good time," he said.
He added he could not wait to work with Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014, as well as Chadwick Boseman - who is currently on the big screen playing Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War.
Jordan played the Human Torch in last year's Fantastic Four flop reboot.  Nyong'o also played CGI character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Black Panther will be released in February 2018. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that actress Ryan Nyong'o played the character Black Panther in the film Star Wars. However, the article does not mention anything about Ryan Nyong'o being in Star Wars. Instead, it mentions that she played a CGI character named Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
2. The summary also states that Ryan Nyong'o played the character Black Panther in the film The New York Panther. There is no such film as The New York Panther mentioned in the article.
3. The article only mentions that Ryan Nyong'o played a CGI character named Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and that she won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014. It does not mention her playing the character Black Panther in any film.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Ryan Nyong'o playing two characters (Black Panther in Star Wars and The New York Panther) that do not exist in the article. The article only mentions her playing one character (Maz Kanata) in one film (Star Wars: The Force Awakens).
