    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the new campus in Scotland will be renamed in honor of author William McIlvanney.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about renaming the campus. Instead, it discusses the new Â£45m facility that will be built in Kilmarnock and the various schools and centers that will be housed there.
3. The only mention of William McIlvanney in the article is that the council leader, Douglas Reid, stated that he was delighted to be able to "preserve" the William McIlvanney name in Kilmarnock as the writer was "passionate about the provision of good education for young people".
4. This suggests that the council is considering naming the campus after McIlvanney, but the article does not confirm this.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the campus will be renamed in honor of McIlvanney, while the article only mentions that the council is considering naming the campus after him.
