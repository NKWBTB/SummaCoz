For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "renamed",
  "largest"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "renamed": The article does not mention anything about the campus being renamed. The article only mentions that the council is considering asking permission from the McIlvanney family to name the campus in his honour. Therefore, the word "renamed" is not supported by the article.
2. "largest": The article does not provide any information about the size of the campus or its ranking in terms of size. The article only mentions that the campus will house primary and secondary schools, a Gaelic school, and a childcare centre. Therefore, the word "largest" is not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary has consistency issues because it contains two statements that are not supported by the article.
