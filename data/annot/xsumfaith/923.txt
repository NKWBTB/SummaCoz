    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the new facility will be named after William McIlvanney, but the article does not mention anything about the facility being named after him. Instead, the article states that the council will ask permission from the McIlvanney family to name the campus in his honour.
2. The summary mentions that William McIlvanney was a novelist, but the article does not provide any information about his profession or background.
3. The summary states that the facility will house primary and secondary schools, a Gaelic school, and a childcare centre, but the article only mentions that the facility will house primary and secondary schools and a Gaelic school.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the location of the facility, but the article states that the facility will be built at Sutherland Drive in Kilmarnock.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, such as the facility being named after William McIlvanney, and it omits information that is present in the article, such as the location of the facility.
