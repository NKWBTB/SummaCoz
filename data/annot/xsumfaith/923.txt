Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the new £45m facility in Ayrshire will be named after William McIlvanney, a renowned writer who was born and educated in Kilmarnock.
2. The article does not mention anything about honoring Mark McIlvanney's novel. In fact, there is no mention of Mark McIlvanney at all in the article.
3. The summary states that the new facility will honor Mark McIlvanney's novel, which is not supported by the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not present in the article.

Overall, the inconsistency in the summary is due to the fact that it refers to Mark McIlvanney and his novel, which are not mentioned in the article.
