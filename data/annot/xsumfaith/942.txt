</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "glasgow",
  "murder"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the body was found in a house in Glenfinnan Road, but the summary says "a house in Glasgow." The article does not mention Glasgow, so this is inconsistent.
2. The article does not mention a murder investigation, but the summary says "a murder investigation is under way." This is inconsistent because the article does not provide any information about a murder investigation.

Therefore, the two spans that have consistency issues are "Glasgow" and "murder." These two statements are not supported by the article, and including them in the summary would be misleading.
