    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a murder investigation is underway, but the article does not mention anything about murder. Instead, it mentions that a post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish the exact cause of death.
2. The summary mentions a man's body being found at a house in Glasgow, which is consistent with the article.
3. However, the summary does not mention anything about police cordoning off the property or a bunch of flowers being laid outside, which are both mentioned in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (murder investigation) and omits information that is present in the article (police cordoning off the property and the bunch of flowers).

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it includes inaccurate information and omits accurate information.
