<Article>
Hatfield Colliery closed in June with the loss of 430 jobs after almost a century of production.
The short ceremony took place at the mine, near Doncaster.
John Grogan, chairman of the Hatfield Employee Benefit Trust, which has run the mine since 2013, said it was "the end of an era".
He said: "On Monday the company will be wound up in the High Court and that will represent the end of coal mining in South Yorkshire after many generations.
"In 1980 there were 50,000 miners in South Yorkshire. On Monday morning when we're in the High Court there will be none.
"We're presenting this piece of coal as a symbol of our respect for all the miners who have gone before us in South Yorkshire and helped build the economy of our country and keep the lights on for many decades."
Accepting the gift the Mayor of Doncaster Ros Jones said: "On behalf of Doncaster and South Yorkshire I'm humbled to accept this."
The only remaining deep coal mine in England, Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire, is due to close later this year.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Hatfield Colliery closed in June with the loss of 430 jobs, but the summary states that the coal mine has collapsed. This is inconsistent, as there is no mention of a collapse in the article.
2. The article explains that the mine closed due to the loss of the coal mine, but the summary attributes the closure to a collapse. This is also inconsistent, as there is no mention of a collapse as the cause of the closure.
3. The article mentions that the mine has been running since 1980 and that there were 50,000 miners in South Yorkshire at one point, but the summary makes no mention of these facts. This lack of information is inconsistent with the article, which provides context and history about the mine.
4. The article quotes John Grogan, the chairman of the Hatfield Employee Benefit Trust, as saying that the mine's closure represents the end of an era and that there will be no more coal mining in South Yorkshire. The summary makes no mention of these quotes or the sentiment behind them. This lack of information is inconsistent with the article, which provides direct quotes and context.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article. The inconsistencies in the summary suggest that it was not carefully written or reviewed, and that it may not be a reliable representation of the article's content.
