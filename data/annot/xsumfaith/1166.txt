    Summary: 
    tesco is looking to unveil its chief executive, yulia tesco,\'s chief executive of the supermarket chain, ksfa, 

    Article: 
    The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time.
Around 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees are to transfer to the new business as part of the deal.
Tesco said in a statement that this is an "orderly and efficient exit from the US market".
Under the terms of the deal, Tesco will loan the new business around Â£80m.
Fresh & Easy, which operates 200 stores across California, Nevada and Arizona, has lost money since opening in 2007.
Tesco did not specify which stores are being transferred to Yucaipa, but it is understood the remaining 50 shops will be closed.
It will cost Tesco Â£150m to dispose of the Fresh & Easy brand, but part of that is a loan which may be paid back.
Also, if Yucaipa is sucessful and the business becomes profitable, Tesco has the option to buy a stake.
Yucaipa is a Los Angeles based private equity company focused on supermaket and restaurant businesses and is run by billionaire investor Ron Burkle.
In April of this year, Tesco reported its first fall in annual profits for 20 years. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "Yulia Tesco" as the Chief Executive of Tesco, but there is no mention of such a person in the article. The correct name is "Dave Lewis" who has been the CEO of Tesco since 2014.
2. The summary states that Tesco is looking to unveil its Chief Executive, but the article does not mention anything about Tesco looking to unveil a new CEO. Instead, the article states that Tesco has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time.
3. The summary mentions that 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees will transfer to the new business as part of the deal, but the article does not mention anything about the transfer of employees.
4. The summary states that Tesco will loan the new business around £80m, but the article does not mention this detail. Instead, the article states that Tesco will dispose of its Fresh & Easy brand at a cost of £150m.
5. The summary mentions that Yucaipa is a Los Angeles-based private equity company, but the article does not mention the location of the company.
6. The summary states that Tesco has the option to buy a stake in the new business if it becomes profitable, but the article does not mention this detail.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. The correct information about Tesco's disposal of its Fresh & Easy chain can be found in the article.
