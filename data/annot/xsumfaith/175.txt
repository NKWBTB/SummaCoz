    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jordan Taylor has scored 24 tries in 37 appearances for Warrington Wolves.
2. The summary states that Castleford Tigers have signed Jordan Taylor on loan until the end of the season.
3. These two statements are not consistent, as Jordan Taylor is currently playing for Warrington Wolves and has not been signed by Castleford Tigers.
4. The article explains that Jordan Taylor could make his debut for Super League's bottom side in Friday's trip to Hull FC, which further supports the fact that he is still a member of Warrington Wolves and has not been signed by Castleford Tigers.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement about Castleford Tigers signing Jordan Taylor on loan is incorrect.
