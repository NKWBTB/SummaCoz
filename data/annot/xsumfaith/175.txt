Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the player, Jordan Taylor, has scored 24 tries in 37 appearances for the Wolves. This information is not consistent with the summary, which states that the player has signed on loan with Castleford Tigers.
2. The article also mentions that Taylor could make his debut for Super League's bottom side in Friday's trip to Hull FC. This information is not included in the summary.
3. The managing director of the Wolves, Richard Thewlis, is quoted in the article as saying that the opportunity for another outside back to come into the squad was there. This information is not included in the summary.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not a accurate representation of the article. The summary does not include all of the information from the article, and it includes information that is not supported by the article. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
