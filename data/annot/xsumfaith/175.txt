</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jordan Taylor is a half-back for Warrington Wolves, and that he has scored 24 tries in 37 appearances for the team.
2. The summary states that Castleford Tigers have signed Jordan Taylor on loan until the end of the season.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other, as Jordan Taylor is currently playing for Warrington Wolves, not Castleford Tigers.
4. The article provides context for the statement about Jordan Taylor's current team, stating that he could make his debut for Super League's bottom side in Friday's trip to Hull FC. This suggests that Jordan Taylor is currently playing for Warrington Wolves and has not been signed by Castleford Tigers.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Jordan Taylor has been signed by Castleford Tigers, when in fact he is currently playing for Warrington Wolves.
