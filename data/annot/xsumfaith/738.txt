]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that MacDonald made 67 league appearances for National League club Torquay after signing in 2014 following the collapse of previous club Salisbury. This indicates that MacDonald is currently playing for Torquay.
2. The summary states that Championship side Barnsley have signed Torquay defender Angus MacDonald on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee. This implies that MacDonald has left Torquay and joined Barnsley.
3. However, the article does not mention anything about MacDonald leaving Torquay or joining Barnsley. In fact, the article quotes the head coach of Torquay, Paul Heckingbottom, saying that the squad is young and hungry, and MacDonald fits that mould perfectly.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that MacDonald has left Torquay and joined Barnsley, whereas the article does not mention any such information.

So, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary states that MacDonald has left Torquay and joined Barnsley, which is not supported by the article.
