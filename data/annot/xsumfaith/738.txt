    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Barnsley, a championship side, has signed Angus MacDonald on a two-year deal. However, the article states that MacDonald has played for National League club Torquay, which is a lower division team. This is inconsistent with the summary as it suggests that MacDonald is joining a higher division team.
2. The article does not mention any transfer fee for MacDonald's move to Barnsley, whereas the summary states that the deal was done for an undisclosed fee. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not be accurate.
3. Additionally, the article does not mention anything about MacDonald being a defender, which is mentioned in the summary. This inconsistency further suggests that the summary may not be accurate.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article and may not be accurate.
