</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that MacDonald made 67 league appearances for Torquay after signing in 2014.
2. The summary states that MacDonald has signed for Championship side Barnsley on a two-year deal.
3. The article does not mention anything about MacDonald signing for Barnsley or leaving Torquay.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not supported by the text.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains new information (MacDonald signing for Barnsley) that is not present in the article.
