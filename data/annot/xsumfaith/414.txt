Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Campaigners from action group Plane Stupid staged the demonstration on Monday in opposition to the airport's expansion plans." This implies that the protest was held by a group of campaigners, not by two individuals.
2. The article also states that "the men and women have been charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome." This suggests that multiple people were involved in the protest, not just two individuals.
3. The summary states that "two men have been arrested in connection with a protest at a protest against a protest at the international airport in London." This implies that there were two individuals involved in the protest, which contradicts the article's statement that multiple people were involved.
4. Additionally, the phrase "a protest at a protest" is nonsensical, as a protest is a single event, not a series of events. This suggests that the summary is not accurately summarizing the article.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and should be revised to accurately reflect the information presented in the article.
