    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that two men were arrested "in connection with a protest at a protest." However, the article does not mention any protests within protests. Instead, it mentions a single protest staged by Campaigners from Action Group Plane Stupid.
2. The summary mentions that the men were charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome. However, the article only mentions that they were charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area, without specifying that it was an aerodrome.
3. The summary states that the protest took place on the northern runway at 03:30 BST on Monday. However, the article does not mention the location of the protest or the time it took place.
4. Finally, the summary mentions that the Metropolitan Police said security at the airport would be reviewed. However, the article does not mention anything about the police reviewing security at the airport.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
