    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Jos Buttler has signed a new three-year contract with Somerset.

However, the article states that Buttler moved to Lancashire in 2013, and his new deal ties him to the club until 2019. This means that he cannot have signed a new three-year contract with Somerset.

2. The summary mentions that Buttler has been playing in the Indian Premier League with Mumbai Indians, which is not mentioned in the article.

3. The article states that Buttler will return to Lancashire for Friday's T20 Blast home game against Durham, which is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not supported by the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
