<Article>
Oxford City Council said the money had mostly been used for "ground investigations of possible sites" but nowhere suitable had been found.
Two cemeteries still have space, in Wolvercote and Botley, but they are expected to be full by 2018 and 2021.
The council said it had not given up and was "still exploring options".
Linda Smith, board member for leisure, parks and sport, said the council has been "searching for a suitable new burial site for many years".
She added: "But ultimately, as with new housing sites, we have run out of suitable land within Oxford.
"So far all the council-owned sites that we have identified have, following ground investigations and surveys, had to be discounted.
"Either due to the size of the site, the ground conditions, a high water table or a covenant restricting the use of the site."
After the two remaining cemeteries are full the council said only the reopening of family plots, the use of a few reserved plots, and the interment of ashes would be possible.
The last increase in burial space in Oxford was in 1932.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Oxford City Council has been "searching for a suitable new burial site for many years" and that they have run out of suitable land within Oxford.
2. The article also states that the council has identified several council-owned sites that have been discounted due to various reasons such as size, ground conditions, high water table, or covenant restrictions.
3. The article does not mention anything about the council losing £30,000 to build a new cemetery.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary "a council has said it has lost almost £30, 000 to build a new cemetery in oxford" is not supported by the article.

The consistency issue in the summary is that the statement about the council losing £30,000 is not accurate and is not supported by the information in the article.
