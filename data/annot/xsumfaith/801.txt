    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a controlled explosion was carried out by police after an explosive device was found at a bomb disposal unit in Cardiff.
2. However, the article states that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit, not the police.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about the police carrying out a controlled explosion.
4. The article states that the controlled explosion was carried out as a precautionary measure after concerns were raised about the safe storage of chemicals.
5. The summary does not mention anything about the safe storage of chemicals or the precautionary nature of the controlled explosion.
6. Therefore, the summary is not only inconsistent with the article, but it also omits important information about the reason for the controlled explosion.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article and should not be relied upon as a summary of the content.
