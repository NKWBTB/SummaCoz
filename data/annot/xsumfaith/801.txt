Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit, not the police.
2. The summary claims that the controlled explosion was carried out by the police.
3. The article states that the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public, which contradicts the summary's suggestion that an explosive device was found.
4. The article states that the chemicals "had become unstable", which is not mentioned in the summary.
