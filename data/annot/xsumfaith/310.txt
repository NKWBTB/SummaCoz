<Article>
The Rhinos have been training across the city of Leeds since the river Aire burst its banks at Christmas.
Chief executive Gary Hetherington told BBC Radio Leeds: "It is looking like £1m in total. It has caused massive disruption.
"But sport throws up all sorts of challenges and this is another one."
All seven training pitches and the main building at the Kirkstall site the Rhinos share with rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie were contaminated by flood water at the end of December.
The Rhinos, who begin the defence of their Super League title against Warrington on 4 February, say that 80 members of staff based at the site, plus 120 players, have been kept out for the last month.
"We couldn't get anywhere near the site," said Hetherington.
"When we were able to access it, the reality hit everybody. The whole site was under water. The changing rooms, medical rooms and gymnasium, and all the equipment was completely destroyed.
"All the pitches are contaminated so they need to be dug up and reseeded. The 3G pitch needs to be replaced. The buildings need to be replastered, all the floors need to come up.
"It will be the best part of six months before we can use the grass pitches and gymnasium."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "grade ii-listed lido",
  "given"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "grade ii-listed lido": The article does not mention anything about a "grade ii-listed lido" in Leeds. The article only mentions that the Rhinos have been training across the city of Leeds since the river Aire burst its banks at Christmas, and that the flooding has caused massive disruption. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not supported by the article.
2. "given": The article does not mention anything about the Rhinos being given £1m to help save the lido. The article only mentions that the Rhinos have been affected by the flooding and that it will take the best part of six months to repair the damage. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is also not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes two phrases that are not supported by the information in the article.
