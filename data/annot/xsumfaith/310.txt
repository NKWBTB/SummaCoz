    Summary: 
    leeds rhinos have been given # 1m to help save the grade ii-listed lido in leeds. 

    Article: 
    The Rhinos have been training across the city of Leeds since the river Aire burst its banks at Christmas.
Chief executive Gary Hetherington told BBC Radio Leeds: "It is looking like £1m in total. It has caused massive disruption.
"But sport throws up all sorts of challenges and this is another one."
All seven training pitches and the main building at the Kirkstall site the Rhinos share with rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie were contaminated by flood water at the end of December.
The Rhinos, who begin the defence of their Super League title against Warrington on 4 February, say that 80 members of staff based at the site, plus 120 players, have been kept out for the last month.
"We couldn't get anywhere near the site," said Hetherington.
"When we were able to access it, the reality hit everybody. The whole site was under water. The changing rooms, medical rooms and gymnasium, and all the equipment was completely destroyed.
"All the pitches are contaminated so they need to be dug up and reseeded. The 3G pitch needs to be replaced. The buildings need to be replastered, all the floors need to come up.
"It will be the best part of six months before we can use the grass pitches and gymnasium." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Leeds Rhinos have been given £1m to help save the grade II-listed lido in Leeds.

However, there is no mention of a lido in the article. Instead, the article discusses the flooding of the Rhinos' training ground and the disruption it has caused to their training.

2. The article does mention that the Rhinos have been given £1m to help with the cleanup and repairs, but this money is not specifically for the lido.

3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a lido, which is not present in the article.

4. The article is focused on the flooding of the Rhinos' training ground and the impact it has had on their training, while the summary is focused on the £1m funding given to the Rhinos.

5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.
