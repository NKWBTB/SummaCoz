    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    plans for a new railway station in lancashire have been approved by councillors in lancashire. also approved plans for the first time. 

    Article: 
    Lancashire County Council has earmarked land on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College.
The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused.
The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre.
Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956.
The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council.
County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an "exciting step forward".
He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion.
He added: "It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area."
The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land.
Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961..
It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that plans for a new railway station in Lancashire have been approved by councillors, and that this is the first time plans have been approved.

However, the article does not mention anything about plans being approved. Instead, it mentions that the council has earmarked land for a potential railway station and that a comparative study has been conducted by Network Rail.

2. The summary states that the railway station will be built in Lancashire, but the article does not provide any information about the location of the proposed station.

3. The summary states that Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans, but the article does not mention anything about Liverpool or the number of trains that could be running through the proposed station.

4. The summary states that the council has confirmed it will start the process of acquiring the relevant land, but the article does not mention anything about the council acquiring land.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and it omits information that is present in the article. For example, the article does not mention anything about plans being approved, and it does not provide any information about the location of the proposed station or the number of trains that could be running through it.
