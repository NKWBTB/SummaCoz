<Article>
Lancashire County Council has earmarked land on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College.
The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused.
The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre.
Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956.
The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council.
County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an "exciting step forward".
He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion.
He added: "It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area."
The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land.
Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961..
It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "plans for a new railway station in Lancashire have been approved by councillors in Lancashire." This is not accurate, as the article states that the council has earmarked land for a potential railway station, but has not yet approved any plans.
2. The summary also states that this is the first time plans for a railway station have been approved in Lancashire. However, the article states that Skelmersdale had a railway station that closed to passengers in 1956, so this is not the first time plans for a railway station have been approved in the area.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the potential location of the new railway station or the partners involved in the plans, which is provided in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains inaccuracies.
