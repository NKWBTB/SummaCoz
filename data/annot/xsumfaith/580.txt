Visitors to the Hebridean Celtic Festival will be able to use an app to trigger online information from items such as signs and posters on the site.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "scottish music",
  "scottish"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "scottish music" - The article does not mention "scottish music" explicitly. While the festival does feature Scottish bands and musicians, the article does not limit the music to only Scottish acts. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
2. "scottish" - The article does not use the word "scottish" to describe the festival or its content. The festival is held on the Isle of Lewis, which is a part of Scotland, but the article does not emphasize the Scottish aspect of the festival. Therefore, this phrase is also not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary should be revised to better reflect the content of the article. Here's a revised summary that is more consistent with the original article:

"The Hebridean Celtic Festival will offer festival-goers an augmented reality experience, allowing them to access online information and interviews, buy tickets, and get a taste of the unique festival atmosphere from anywhere in the world."
