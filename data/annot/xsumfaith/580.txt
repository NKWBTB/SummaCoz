    Summary: 
    a scottish music event is to offer festival-goers an augmented reality experience.

    Visitors to the Hebridean Celtic Festival will be able to use an app to trigger online information from items such as signs and posters on the site.
Videos and band interviews will be among the online material available to view on phones and tablets.

The Waterboys, Imelda May, Lucy Spraggan, Skerryvore, Peatbog Faeries and Dougie MacLean are among this year's acts.
HebCelt director Caroline Maclennan said: "We are offering the new augmented reality experience as an extra feature to add to the enjoyment of visiting the festival this year.
"But it will also mean people around the world can interact with the festival and capture a flavour of its atmosphere at any time.
"The message will be updated in the run up to HebCelt and during the event, allowing people to instantly access information and interviews, buy tickets and also get a taste of our unique festival wherever they are." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Hebridean Celtic Festival is offering an augmented reality experience to festival-goers.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about an augmented reality experience. Instead, it talks about an app that will allow visitors to access online information, videos, and band interviews.
3. The article does mention that the app will provide an "extra feature" to enhance the festival experience, but it does not describe this feature as an augmented reality experience.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the festival is offering an augmented reality experience, which is not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is an overstatement or exaggeration of the information provided in the article.
