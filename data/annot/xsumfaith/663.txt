    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    declan mcmanus scored twice as greenock morton beat scottish championship bottom side alloa athletic, who remain 10 points adrift. 

    Article: 
    McManus netted from close range on the quarter-hour mark to open the scoring and Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead.
A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time.
But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Declan McManus scored twice, but the article states that he netted once and Denny Johnstone scored late on, so the summary is not consistent with the article.

2. The summary states that Greenock Morton beat Scottish Championship bottom side Alloa Athletic, but the article states that Alloa pulled one back before half-time, so the summary is not accurate.

3. The summary does not mention Ross Forbes' deflected strike, which is mentioned in the article as one of the goals scored by Greenock Morton.

4. The summary states that Alloa remain 10 points adrift, but the article does not mention this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reasons for this are:

* The summary does not accurately reflect the number of goals scored by Declan McManus.
* The summary does not accurately reflect the final score of the match.
* The summary does not mention a significant event mentioned in the article (Ross Forbes' deflected strike).
* The summary includes information not present in the article (Alloa's position in the league table).
