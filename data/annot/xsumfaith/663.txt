Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "McManus netted from close range on the quarter-hour mark to open the scoring." However, the summary states "declan mcmanus scored twice." This is inconsistent because the article only mentions one goal scored by McManus.
2. The article also states "Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead." However, the summary does not mention this goal at all. This is inconsistent because the article mentions a second goal scored by Morton, but the summary does not include this information.
3. The article states "A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time." However, the summary does not mention this goal at all. This is inconsistent because the article mentions a goal scored by Alloa, but the summary does not include this information.
4. The article states "But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts." However, the summary only mentions one goal scored by McManus. This is inconsistent because the article mentions two goals scored by McManus, but the summary only includes one.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. Specifically, it misrepresents the number of goals scored by McManus and does not include information about the other goals scored in the match.
