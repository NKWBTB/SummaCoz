</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Declan McManus scored twice for Greenock Morton in their win against Alloa Athletic.
2. The article does not mention Declan McManus as one of the goalscorers for Morton. Instead, it mentions McManus netting from close range on the quarter-hour mark, but does not specify that he scored twice.
3. The article mentions Ross Forbes' deflected strike as the second goal for Morton, but the summary does not include this information.
4. The summary states that Alloa remain 10 points adrift, but the article does not mention this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Incorrectly states that Declan McManus scored twice, when the article only mentions one goal for him.
* Omits Ross Forbes' goal, which is mentioned in the article.
* Includes information about Alloa's position in the table, which is not present in the article.

Overall, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
