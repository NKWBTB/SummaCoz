<Article>
The turkey firm was sold to the food tycoon Ranjit Boparan on Tuesday.
There had been fears that the new owners would not take on the existing workers' pension scheme.
But Unite regional officer Steve Harley said: "We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured."
Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover.
The Boparan Private Office, the "chicken king" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.
Mr Harley met with representatives from Boparan at the Great Witchingham headquarters.
He said: "It was made clear that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business.
"This would be achieved by greater investment in the business, cost savings and utilising the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just turkeys."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "restore bernard matthews's chicken and chicken" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about restoring chicken. The article only mentions that the new owner, Ranjit Boparan, plans to invest in the business, achieve cost savings, and utilize the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just turkeys. There is no mention of restoring chicken.
2. "chicken and chicken" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the article only mentions chicken once, and that is in the context of the new owner's plans to process chicken and not just turkeys. There is no mention of chicken and chicken.
3. "union" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about a union. The article only mentions that Unite regional officer Steve Harley had productive talks with representatives from Boparan at the Great Witchingham headquarters, and that he was given guarantees that all current agreements would be honored. There is no mention of a union.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains phrases that are not supported by the information in the article.
