    Summary: 
    a new pension scheme to restore bernard matthews\'s chicken and chicken has been given guarantees by the unite union. 

    Article: 
    The turkey firm was sold to the food tycoon Ranjit Boparan on Tuesday.
There had been fears that the new owners would not take on the existing workers' pension scheme.
But Unite regional officer Steve Harley said: "We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured."
Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover.
The Boparan Private Office, the "chicken king" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.
Mr Harley met with representatives from Boparan at the Great Witchingham headquarters.
He said: "It was made clear that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business.
"This would be achieved by greater investment in the business, cost savings and utilising the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just turkeys." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a new pension scheme has been given to Bernard Matthews' chicken, but the article does not mention anything about a new pension scheme.
2. The summary mentions that the new owners will honor all current agreements, but the article states that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews will continue under the new ownership.
3. The summary states that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business, but the article does not mention anything about this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions a new pension scheme, which is not mentioned in the article, and it also mentions the new owner's desire to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position, which is also not mentioned in the article.
