    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a suspected human foot has been found in a park in bristol, police have said. 

    Article: 
    The limb was found in a garden in Cranwells Park on Wednesday and has been sent for forensic analysis, Avon and Somerset Police said.
A force spokesman said detectives were "keeping an open mind" as to whether it was linked to two similar incidents in the city.
All three feet have been found within a few hundred yards of each other.
Tests showed the first foot found in Weston Park East in February was  "probably" a medical teaching aid. The second foot, found last month in the same area, is still undergoing tests.
"The same officers are looking into the latest discoveries and will look to confirm beyond all reasonable doubt that they are linked and if there are any new lines of inquiry which can be taken forward," the spokesman added. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the limb was found in a park in Bristol, while the article states that the limb was found in a garden in Cranwells Park. This is inconsistent, as the article does not mention the limb being found in a park.
2. The summary states that the police have said that the limb is a human foot, while the article states that the police are keeping an open mind as to whether it is linked to two similar incidents in the city. This is inconsistent, as the summary implies that the police have confirmed that the limb is a human foot, while the article states that the police are still investigating and have not made any conclusions.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the first foot found in Weston Park East in February was "probably" a medical teaching aid, which is mentioned in the article. This is inconsistent, as the summary does not provide all the information contained in the article.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article.
