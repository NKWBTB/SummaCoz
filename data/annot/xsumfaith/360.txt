The limb was found in a garden in Cranwells Park on Wednesday and has been sent for forensic analysis, Avon and Somerset Police said.
A force spokesman said detectives were "keeping an open mind" as to whether it was linked to two similar incidents in the city.
All three feet have been found within a few hundred yards of each other.
Tests showed the first foot found in Weston Park East in February was  "probably" a medical teaching aid. The second foot, found last month in the same area, is still undergoing tests.
"The same officers are looking into the latest discoveries and will look to confirm beyond all reasonable doubt that they are linked and if there are any new lines of inquiry which can be taken forward," the spokesman added.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the limb was found in a garden in Cranwells Park, but the summary says it was found in a park in Bristol. This is inconsistent because the article specifically mentions the location of the find as Cranwells Park, while the summary simply says "a park in Bristol."
2. The article does not mention the word "suspected" in relation to the limb found. The summary introduces this word, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, based on these two inconsistencies, it can be concluded that the summary is not consistent with the article.
