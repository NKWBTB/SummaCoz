    Summary: 
    mcdonald\'s has said it is ``deeply concerned\'\'about the future of mcdonald\'s restaurants in mcdonald\'s restaurants. 

    Article: 
    A formal complaint has been made to the European Commission by a group of Italian consumers' organisations.
They accuse McDonald's of forcing franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees.
McDonald's said it shared risks and rewards with its licencees.
In a statement, McDonald's said: "We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses.
"This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers."
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European unions, including the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union in the UK, are supporting the formal antitrust complaint.
"McDonald's abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald's accountable," said SEIU organising director, Scott Courtney.
The European Commission said it would now study the submission. It has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded.
The consumer organisations claim franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts.
They also said licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates.
It is claimed this leads to poorer consumer choice and higher prices in franchise stores as opposed to those owned directly by the company.
Franchisees own and operate 73% of McDonald's restaurants in Europe.
McDonald's received $9.27bn (Â£6.40bn) in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide in 2014. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that McDonald's is "deeply concerned" about the future of its restaurants, but the article does not mention anything about McDonald's being concerned. Instead, it mentions a formal complaint made by a group of Italian consumers' organisations against McDonald's.
2. The summary mentions that McDonald's forces franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees, but the article does not support this claim. In fact, the article states that McDonald's shares risks and rewards with its licencees, and that the approach has been successful for many years.
3. The summary mentions that the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European unions are supporting the formal antitrust complaint, but the article does not mention the SEIU or any other unions.
4. The summary mentions that franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts, but the article does not mention anything about contracts or switching to competitors.
5. The summary mentions that licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates, but the article does not mention anything about lease rates or premises.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary claims that McDonald's is "deeply concerned" about its future, but the article does not mention any such concern. Additionally, the summary claims that McDonald's forces franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees, but the article states that McDonald's shares risks and rewards with its licencees. Finally, the summary mentions several claims that are not supported by the article, such as the SEIU and European unions supporting the formal antitrust complaint, and franchisees being prevented from switching to competitors.
