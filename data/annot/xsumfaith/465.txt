<Article>
A formal complaint has been made to the European Commission by a group of Italian consumers' organisations.
They accuse McDonald's of forcing franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees.
McDonald's said it shared risks and rewards with its licencees.
In a statement, McDonald's said: "We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses.
"This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers."
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European unions, including the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union in the UK, are supporting the formal antitrust complaint.
"McDonald's abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald's accountable," said SEIU organising director, Scott Courtney.
The European Commission said it would now study the submission. It has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded.
The consumer organisations claim franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts.
They also said licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates.
It is claimed this leads to poorer consumer choice and higher prices in franchise stores as opposed to those owned directly by the company.
Franchisees own and operate 73% of McDonald's restaurants in Europe.
McDonald's received $9.27bn (Â£6.40bn) in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide in 2014.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "deeply concerned'': The word "deeply" is not present in the original article. The article states that McDonald's "shared risks and rewards with its licencees" and "is proud of its franchisees," but it does not mention the company being "deeply concerned" about anything.
2. "about the future": The article does not mention the future of McDonald's restaurants. It discusses the present situation and allegations made by consumer organisations.
3. "in mcdonald's restaurants": This phrase is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about McDonald's restaurants. The article discusses McDonald's franchisees and the allegations made by consumer organisations.
4. "mcdonald's restaurants": The correct spelling is "McDonald's" with an initial capital letter. The summary uses lowercase "mcdonald's" throughout.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains words and phrases that are not present in the original article, and it uses incorrect spelling and capitalization.
