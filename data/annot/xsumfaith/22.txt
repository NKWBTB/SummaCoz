For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "former england under-21 world champion shaun mckenzie will fight for the vacant wbc world title at york\\'s alexandra palace on 29 april"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that McKenzie will fight for the English super-middleweight championship, not the WBC world title.

2. The summary mentions that McKenzie will fight for the vacant WBC world title, which is not consistent with the article.

3. The article does not mention anything about McKenzie being a former England under-21 world champion, which is also not consistent with the summary.

4. The venue mentioned in the summary, Alexandra Palace, is not mentioned in the article. The article states that the fight will take place at York Hall.

Therefore, based on the above inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
