</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that McKenzie will fight for the English super-middleweight championship on November 12th at York Hall.
2. The summary states that McKenzie will fight for the vacant WBC world title on April 29th at York's Alexandra Palace.
3. These two dates and titles do not match. The article mentions a domestic championship fight in November, while the summary mentions a world title fight in April.
4. Additionally, the article does not mention anything about McKenzie being a former England under-21 world champion, which is stated in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains incorrect information about the date, title, and McKenzie's background.
