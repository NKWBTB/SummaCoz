    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Mansfield Town has signed Marcus Bignot on loan until the end of the season. However, the article states that Bignot's side have reached an agreement to bring him in on a free transfer. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Bignot is being loaned to Mansfield Town, whereas the article states that he is being signed on a free transfer.

2. The summary also mentions that Bignot has spent the first half of the season on loan at Crawley, which is not accurate. According to the article, he spent the first half of the season on loan at Crawley, but he is now joining Mansfield Town on a free transfer.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and implies that Bignot is being loaned to Mansfield Town when he is actually joining on a free transfer.
