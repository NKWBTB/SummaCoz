Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Marcus Bignot is joining Grimsby Town on a free transfer, not Mansfield Town. The summary incorrectly states that Mansfield Town has signed Marcus Bignot on loan.
2. The article mentions that Marcus Bignot spent the first half of the season on loan at Crawley, scoring three goals in 23 appearances. The summary does not include this information.
3. The article states that Marcus Bignot will officially join Grimsby Town on January 1st, becoming Bignot's first signing for the Mariners. The summary does not mention this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the team that signed Marcus Bignot, his loan status, and his scoring record at Crawley.
