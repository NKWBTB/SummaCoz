     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Number of clubs: The summary states that Shanghai SIPG has agreed to sign up to 1,000 Chinese Super League clubs, while the article only mentions the signing of one player, Carlos Tevez, and one coach, Gus Poyet.
2. Contract details: The summary does not provide any information about the contract details of Tevez, while the article mentions that the deal is worth £40m and includes a salary in excess of £310,000 a week.
3. Club information: The summary mentions Shanghai SIPG, while the article only mentions Shanghai.
4. Player information: The summary mentions Tevez, but the article only mentions Oscar as the player signed by Shanghai SIPG.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides incorrect information about the number of clubs signed, contract details, club information, and player information.
