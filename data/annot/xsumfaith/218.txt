Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident occurred at Singleton Park, but the summary incorrectly says "students at swansea university have been moved from the site." This is inconsistent because Singleton Park is not part of the university, it's a separate location where the incident occurred.
2. The article does not mention any students being moved from the site. Instead, it reports that lectures were moved to other buildings as a precautionary measure. The summary incorrectly states that students were moved from the site.
3. The article states that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit, but the summary does not mention this detail. This is inconsistent because the article provides important information about the nature of the incident and the response to it.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important details.
