    Summary: 
    students at swansea university have been moved from the site following a controlled explosion. 

    Article: 
    The university said the move at Singleton Park was "precautionary".
South Wales Police received a call at about 13:30 BST after concerns about the safe storage of chemicals before a controlled explosion took place.
Nobody was injured and a police spokesman said a cordon erected was precautionary while the chemicals were removed.
Student Alex Jones said there was "some panic" at the start of the incident and lectures were moved away from the area to other buildings.
South Wales Police said the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public.
The university said the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals "had become unstable". 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that students at Swansea University were moved from the site following a controlled explosion. However, the article does not mention any controlled explosion.
2. The article explains that the move was precautionary due to concerns about the safe storage of chemicals. This suggests that the students were moved as a precautionary measure, but not because of a controlled explosion.
3. The article also states that the chemicals "had become unstable", which further supports the idea that the students were moved as a precautionary measure, rather than due to a controlled explosion.
4. The summary does not mention the reason for the move, which is a key piece of information that is missing.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary implies that a controlled explosion took place, but the article does not support this claim.
