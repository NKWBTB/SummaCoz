    Summary: 
    fiji, fiji, fiji, fiji and fiji have been one of the country\'s best-known economies since the 2011 coup. 

    Article: 
    However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation.
In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.
A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.
These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.
Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.
In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.
In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.
Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.
The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.
Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.
There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.
Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing.
Nonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "Fiji, fiji, fiji, fiji, and fiji" as one of the country's best-known economies since the 2011 coup, implying that Fiji's economy has been consistently strong and stable. However, the article states that Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, which is not consistent with a strong and stable economy.
2. The summary does not mention any of the political instability, coups, and international isolation that the article highlights as major factors affecting Fiji's economy. The article states that Fiji has experienced four coups in 20 years, which has caused great harm to the economy, particularly the tourism industry.
3. The summary mentions that Fiji's population is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, but it does not mention the tensions and divisions between the two groups, which the article highlights as a source of instability.
4. The summary does not mention Fiji's suspension from the Commonwealth in 2009, which the article states was due to Fiji's lack of progress towards democracy.

Overall, the summary presents a misleadingly positive view of Fiji's economy and fails to mention the significant political instability and international isolation that the article highlights.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions Fiji as one of the country's best-known economies since the 2011 coup, implying that Fiji's economy has been consistently strong and stable. However, the article states that Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, which is not consistent with a strong and stable economy.
2. The summary mentions the 2011 coup. However, the article states nothing about the 2011 coup.
3. The summary uses the phrase "fiji, fiji, fiji, fiji and fiji", which is repetitive and does not make any sense.
