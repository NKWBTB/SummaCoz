]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the boat capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug.
2. The summary states that the three people were rescued from a burning boat off a river in the Firth of Forth, Scotland.
3. The article does not mention anything about a burning boat. Instead, it states that the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service initially said one of the three teenagers made it ashore, and efforts were being made to reach the other two who were stranded on an island in the river.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary about the boat being on fire is not supported by the article.
5. Additionally, the summary states that the three people were rescued, but the article only mentions that one of the teenagers made it ashore and efforts were being made to reach the other two.
6. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information about the boat being on fire and the number of people rescued.
