<Summary>
three people have been rescued from a burning boat off a river in the firth of forth, scotland.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that three people were rescued from a burning boat off a river in the Firth of Forth, Scotland.
2. The article states that the boat capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug, and that the three people were stranded on an island in the river.
3. The article does not mention that the boat was burning.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a burning boat, which is not present in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it includes the detail of the boat being on fire, which is not supported by the article.
