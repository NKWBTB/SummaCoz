</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article is about a woman who was found lying on a pavement in Hamelin, Germany with serious injuries, and her ex-partner has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
2. The summary, on the other hand, states that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death in New York City.
3. The two locations mentioned in the article and the summary are not the same. Hamelin is in Germany, while New York City is in the United States.
4. The article does not mention anything about the victim being stabbed to death, but rather that she had serious injuries and underwent an emergency operation.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that the victim was stabbed to death, which is not supported by the information in the article.
