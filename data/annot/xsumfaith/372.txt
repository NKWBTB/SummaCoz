Oxford City Council said the money had mostly been used for "ground investigations of possible sites" but nowhere suitable had been found.
Two cemeteries still have space, in Wolvercote and Botley, but they are expected to be full by 2018 and 2021.
The council said it had not given up and was "still exploring options".
Linda Smith, board member for leisure, parks and sport, said the council has been "searching for a suitable new burial site for many years".
She added: "But ultimately, as with new housing sites, we have run out of suitable land within Oxford.
"So far all the council-owned sites that we have identified have, following ground investigations and surveys, had to be discounted.
"Either due to the size of the site, the ground conditions, a high water table or a covenant restricting the use of the site."
After the two remaining cemeteries are full the council said only the reopening of family plots, the use of a few reserved plots, and the interment of ashes would be possible.
The last increase in burial space in Oxford was in 1932.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the site of a new burial site in Oxford has been approved by the city council.
2. However, the article states that the council has not found a suitable new burial site and has been searching for many years.
3. The article also mentions that the two remaining cemeteries in Oxford are expected to be full by 2018 and 2021, and that only a few reserved plots and the interment of ashes would be possible after they are full.
4. Therefore, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of the council approving a new burial site.
5. The inconsistency can be attributed to the fact that the summary is a misleading statement that does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
6. The article provides information about the council's ongoing search for a new burial site and the limited burial space available in Oxford, but the summary does not convey this information accurately.
