<Article>
Oxford City Council said the money had mostly been used for "ground investigations of possible sites" but nowhere suitable had been found.
Two cemeteries still have space, in Wolvercote and Botley, but they are expected to be full by 2018 and 2021.
The council said it had not given up and was "still exploring options".
Linda Smith, board member for leisure, parks and sport, said the council has been "searching for a suitable new burial site for many years".
She added: "But ultimately, as with new housing sites, we have run out of suitable land within Oxford.
"So far all the council-owned sites that we have identified have, following ground investigations and surveys, had to be discounted.
"Either due to the size of the site, the ground conditions, a high water table or a covenant restricting the use of the site."
After the two remaining cemeteries are full the council said only the reopening of family plots, the use of a few reserved plots, and the interment of ashes would be possible.
The last increase in burial space in Oxford was in 1932.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the city council has not given up and is "still exploring options" for a new burial site. This implies that no specific site has been approved yet.
2. The article mentions that the council has been searching for a suitable new burial site for many years, but so far, all the council-owned sites that have been identified have had to be discounted due to various reasons such as size, ground conditions, high water table, or covenant restrictions.
3. The article does not mention anything about a specific site being approved. Instead, it states that the council is still exploring options and that only the reopening of family plots, the use of a few reserved plots, and the interment of ashes would be possible after the two remaining cemeteries are full.
4. Therefore, based on the information in the article, it is not accurate to say that the site of a new burial site in Oxford has been approved by the city council. Instead, the council is still in the process of exploring options and has not yet identified a suitable site.

So, the span "approved" in the summary is not consistent with the article.
