    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a driver who killed a motorcyclist in conwy county has been jailed for six months. 

    Article: 
    Hospital radiographer Aidan McNicholl, 36, died following the collision on the A5 at Cerrigydrudion on Sunday.
Andreas Werner, 46, of Leipzig, failed to spot the motorcyclist as he turned his VW Transporter right causing the fatal crash.
The father-of-four pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Llandudno Magistrates' Court.
He was fined Â£1,000 and also banned from driving in the UK for two years.
Prosecutor Sarah Marsh told the court the victim's family saw no value in Werner, who was staying in a cottage with his family near Bala, being sent to jail.
She said: "They accept it was a momentary lapse and nothing will bring him back."
Craig Hutchinson, defending, said Werner was remorseful and could offer no explanation for the crash. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the driver was jailed for six months, but the article states that the driver was fined £1,000 and banned from driving in the UK for two years. This is not consistent, as the article does not mention any jail sentence.
2. The summary also states that the driver failed to spot the motorcyclist, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the driver pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving.
3. The summary mentions the victim's family seeing no value in the driver being sent to jail, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that the prosecutor said the family accepted that it was a momentary lapse and nothing would bring the victim back.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
