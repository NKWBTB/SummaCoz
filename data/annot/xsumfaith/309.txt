<Article>
Wellington monument on the Blackdown Hills, in Somerset, was built in 1817 but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris.
The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding.
Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was "crucial".
Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo.
But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been "expensive and unsustainable".
Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to "understand this unique and somewhat complex monument".
"We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected," he said.
"The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk."
Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a "more effective repair approach".

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Duke of Wellington has been given the go-ahead by the National Trust. However, the article does not mention anything about the Duke of Wellington being given approval by the National Trust.
2. The summary implies that the National Trust is responsible for the Duke of Wellington, which is not accurate. The article states that the National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar to study the Wellington monument, but it does not mention anything about the Duke of Wellington.
3. The summary uses the phrase "one of the UK's most famous landmarks," which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions the Wellington monument, not any other landmarks.
4. The summary is written in a very brief and simplistic style, which is not consistent with the detail and complexity of the article. The article provides specific information about the Wellington monument, such as its history, the materials used to build it, and the reasons for its current state.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Mentions the Duke of Wellington, which is not mentioned in the article.
* Implies that the National Trust is responsible for the Duke of Wellington, which is not accurate.
* Uses a phrase that is not supported by the article ("one of the UK's most famous landmarks").
* Is written in a very brief and simplistic style, which is not consistent with the detail and complexity of the article.
