It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
Wellington monument on the Blackdown Hills, in Somerset, was built in 1817 but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris.
The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding.
Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was "crucial".
Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo.
But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been "expensive and unsustainable".
Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to "understand this unique and somewhat complex monument".
"We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected," he said.
"The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk."
Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a "more effective repair approach".

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "duke",
  "one of the uk\\'s most famous",
  "given the go-ahead"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "duke": The article does not mention the word "duke" at all. The correct term used in the article is "Duke of Wellington."
2. "one of the uk's most famous": The article does not describe the Wellington monument as "one of the uk's most famous" landmarks. It simply states that it is a "landmark" on the Blackdown Hills in Somerset.
3. "given the go-ahead": The article does not mention anything about the National Trust giving the Wellington monument "the go-ahead." Instead, it states that the National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar to study the monument and develop a more effective repair approach.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains three inaccuracies:

* It misquotes the name of the monument, referring to it as "the duke" instead of "the Duke of Wellington."
* It exaggerates the significance of the monument, describing it as "one of the uk's most famous" instead of simply a "landmark" in Somerset.
* It misrepresents the National Trust's actions, stating that they have "given the go-ahead" when in fact they are simply using ground-penetrating radar to study the monument and develop a repair approach.
