</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Tom Wells is an all-rounder, but the article does not mention anything about his bowling or other skills besides his batting.
2. The summary mentions a new two-year contract, but the article only mentions Wells' performance in the T20 Blast last season and does not mention any contract extensions.
3. The summary does not provide any specific details about the contract, such as the length of the contract or the salary, while the article provides more information about Wells' batting statistics and his praise for the club's environment.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about Wells' skills, contract, or performance.
