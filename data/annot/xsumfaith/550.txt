Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Wells impressed in the T20 Blast last season, scoring 373 runs at 28.69 with a strike rate of 138.66.
2. The summary states that Wells has signed a new two-year contract with Leicestershire until the end of the 2018 season.
3. The article does not mention anything about Wells signing a new contract or committing to Leicestershire for two years.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Wells has signed a new two-year contract is not supported by the article.
5. Additionally, the phrase "all-rounder" is not used in the article to describe Wells, so it is not consistent with the article to refer to him as an all-rounder in the summary.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not mentioned in the article (Wells signing a new contract) and uses a term (all-rounder) that is not used in the article to describe Wells.
