    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Tom Wells has signed a new two-year contract with Leicestershire, which is not consistent with the article.
2. The article does not mention anything about Tom Wells signing a new contract. Instead, it mentions his performance in the T20 Blast last season and his positive comments about the club's direction.
3. Therefore, the summary is not supported by the article, and it is not consistent with the information provided.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the article does not mention Tom Wells signing a new contract, whereas the summary states that he has signed a new two-year contract.
