<Article>
Police said that someone opened fire from a passing car and witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired close to the main police station.
"Nothing is known about the culprits yet but we can guess that this involves local crime gangs," investigators told German media.
The suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off.
The shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, as local people enjoyed the Ascension Day holiday in the sunshine.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "up to a dozen shots" were fired, but the summary only mentions "shots" in the plural form, without specifying the number.
2. The article states that "at least three people were wounded", but the summary only mentions "two seriously". This implies that the summary is not consistent with the article's statement that at least three people were wounded.
3. The article mentions that the shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, but the summary does not provide any information about the location of the shooting.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey all the information provided in the article. Specifically, it understates the number of people wounded and fails to mention the location of the shooting.
