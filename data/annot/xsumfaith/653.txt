    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    at least three people were wounded, two seriously, when shots were fired in the german city of frankfurt on thursday. 

    Article: 
    Police said that someone opened fire from a passing car and witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired close to the main police station.
"Nothing is known about the culprits yet but we can guess that this involves local crime gangs," investigators told German media.
The suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off.
The shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, as local people enjoyed the Ascension Day holiday in the sunshine. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "at least three people were wounded, two seriously." However, the article does not mention any wounded people. Instead, it states that "Police said that someone opened fire from a passing car."
2. The summary implies that the shooting was a targeted attack, as it states "three people were wounded, two seriously." However, the article does not provide any information to support this claim. Instead, it suggests that the shooting may have been a random act of violence, as the police have not identified any specific targets.
3. The summary mentions "up to a dozen shots being fired," but the article only states that "someone opened fire from a passing car." This suggests that the summary may have exaggerated the number of shots fired.
4. The summary states that "the suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off." However, the article does not mention any suspects or a cordoned-off area. Instead, it states that the police have not identified any culprits and are investigating the incident.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article provides a more factual and nuanced account of the incident, and does not support the sensationalized claims made in the summary.
