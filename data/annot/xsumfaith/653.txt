<Article>
Police said that someone opened fire from a passing car and witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired close to the main police station.
"Nothing is known about the culprits yet but we can guess that this involves local crime gangs," investigators told German media.
The suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off.
The shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, as local people enjoyed the Ascension Day holiday in the sunshine.

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "someone opened fire from a passing car" and "witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired." This implies that there were multiple shooters and multiple shots fired.
2. The summary states that "at least three people were wounded, two seriously." This implies that there were only three people wounded, which contradicts the article's mention of "up to a dozen shots."
3. The article does not mention any information about the seriousness of the wounds, while the summary states that two of the wounded were seriously injured. This is not supported by the article.
4. The article states that the shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, while the summary does not provide any information about the location of the shooting.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the number of people wounded, the seriousness of the wounds, or the location of the shooting.
