<Summary>
a former football football football player has appeared in court accused of stealing millions of pounds worth of money.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the accused is a "former football football football player." However, the article does not mention anything about the accused being a former football player. Instead, it states that the accused is an accountant.
2. The summary claims that the accused has been accused of stealing "millions of pounds worth of money." However, the article states that the accused is accused of stealing £572,206 from Patrick Bradley Ltd, which is a much smaller amount than "millions of pounds."
3. The summary does not provide any information about the charges against the accused, other than the fact that they are accused of stealing money. The article, on the other hand, provides detailed information about the charges, including the amount of money allegedly stolen and the time period during which the alleged thefts occurred.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information about the accused's identity and the charges against them. The summary also omits important details about the alleged thefts that are provided in the article.
