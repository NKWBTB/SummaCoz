    Summary: 
    a former football football football player has appeared in court accused of stealing millions of pounds worth of money. 

    Article:

The accused's name was given to Coleraine Magistrates Court as John Malachy McGurk of Oakland Crescent in Knockloughrim, Magherafelt, County Londonderry.
He was charged with stealing £572,206 from Patrick Bradley Ltd, based in Kilrea, also in County Londonderry.
Mr McGurk was also accused of 36 counts of fraud relating to sums of allegedly stolen money lodged in his bank account.
All the offences are alleged to have happened between 1 July 2006 and 31 December 2011. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the accused is a former football player, but the article does not mention anything about football or sports.
2. The summary mentions that the accused is accused of stealing millions of pounds, but the article only mentions £572,206 as the amount allegedly stolen.
3. The summary mentions 36 counts of fraud, but the article only mentions one count of fraud.
4. The summary states that the accused will appear in court on 19 November, but the article does not mention a specific date for the next court appearance.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
