Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "millions of pounds" - The article states that Mr. McGurk is accused of stealing £572,206, which is not millions of pounds. The summary exaggerates the amount of money allegedly stolen.
2. "former" - The article does not mention that Mr. McGurk is a former football player. He is currently an accountant and was accused of theft. The summary is inaccurate in describing him as a former football player.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two inaccuracies. The first inaccuracy is the exaggeration of the amount of money allegedly stolen, and the second inaccuracy is the misdescription of Mr. McGurk's current profession.
