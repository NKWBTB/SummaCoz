    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the cyclist suffered serious head injuries, but the article states that the injuries were not life-threatening. This is a contradiction, as serious head injuries are typically considered to be life-threatening.
2. The article states that the cyclist was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries, which suggests that the injuries were not as severe as the summary implies.
3. The article also states that the A96 was closed in the area for several hours, but it has since reopened. This implies that the incident was not as severe as the summary suggests, as the road would not have been closed for such a long time if the injuries were more severe.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the severity of the injuries and does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
