<Article>
Symbols of every event feature on the design, while the London skyline is included with Tower Bridge, the London Eye, the Shard and Big Ben.
The reverse features London Stadium, the championships' venue.
The event takes place from 4-13 August and there will be live coverage across the BBC.
Medals at July's World Para Athletics Championships, taking place from 14-23 July, will be similar, but feature distinctive disability sport equipment such as a prosthetic running leg and throwing chair.
Rather than engraving, the reverse will be inscribed with braille.
For the first time at the World Championships, 'coaches medals' will also be handed out to recognise those who prepare athletes.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "shape based on the curves of an athletics track",
  "will be won in london this summer have been revealed, with a shape based on the curves of an athletics track",
  "summer",
  "\\nthe world championships medals that will be won in london this summer have been revealed, with a shape based on the curves of an athletics track"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "shape based on the curves of an athletics track" - The article does not mention anything about the shape of the medals being based on the curves of an athletics track. The article only mentions that the medals will feature symbols of every event, the London skyline, and the London Stadium, but does not mention the shape of the medals.
2. "will be won in london this summer have been revealed, with a shape based on the curves of an athletics track" - This sentence is a combination of two separate sentences from the article: "The event takes place from 4-13 August" and "Medals at July's World Para Athletics Championships, taking place from 14-23 July, will be similar, but feature distinctive disability sport equipment such as a prosthetic running leg and throwing chair." The sentence is not present in the article as it is written.
3. "summer" - The article does not mention anything about summer. The event takes place from 4-13 August and 14-23 July, but the article does not use the word "summer".
4. "the world championships medals that will be won in london this summer have been revealed, with a shape based on the curves of an athletics track" - This sentence is a combination of two separate sentences from the article: "The event takes place from 4-13 August" and "Medals at July's World Para Athletics Championships, taking place from 14-23 July, will be similar, but feature distinctive disability sport equipment such as a prosthetic running leg and throwing chair." The sentence is not present in the article as it is written.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and combines two separate sentences from the article into one sentence.
