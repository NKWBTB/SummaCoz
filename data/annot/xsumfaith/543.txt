</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the World Championships medals have been revealed and have a shape based on the curves of an athletics track.
2. The article does not mention anything about the shape of the medals or their design being based on an athletics track.
3. Instead, the article mentions that the medals will feature symbols of every event, including Tower Bridge, the London Eye, the Shard, and Big Ben, and that the reverse will be inscribed with braille.
4. The article also mentions that the medals will be similar to those awarded at the World Para Athletics Championships, but with distinctive disability sport equipment such as a prosthetic running leg and throwing chair.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the design or features of the medals.
