</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Northumberland County Council is using Jetpatcher machines to fill in potholes, indicating that the potholes are still present and need to be repaired.
2. The summary states that potholes on the Isle of Wight are set to be closed, implying that the potholes have already been repaired.
3. The article does not mention the Isle of Wight or any plans to close potholes.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to a different location (the Isle of Wight) and a different action (closing potholes, rather than filling them).
