    Article: 
    Northumberland County Council said the weather was now warm enough for its Jetpatcher machines to tackle the holes.
It is hoped that 145 potholes each day will be "filled in" over the next four months, the council said.
Extra staff will also be out repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain and to clear debris from gutters. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that potholes on the Isle of Wight are set to be closed for the first time in more than six months.

This is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of potholes being closed. Instead, the article states that the council will be filling in potholes using Jetpatcher machines.

2. The article states that Northumberland County Council will be using Jetpatcher machines to fill in 145 potholes each day over the next four months.

This is not mentioned in the summary at all.

3. The article also mentions that extra staff will be out repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain and clearing debris from gutters.

This is not mentioned in the summary either.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary only mentions potholes being closed, while the article mentions potholes being filled in and other repairs being done.
