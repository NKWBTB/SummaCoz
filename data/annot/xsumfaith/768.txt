</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "potholes on the isle of wight are set to be closed for the first time in more than six months",
  "isle of wight are set to be closed for the first time in more than six months"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Northumberland County Council is using Jetpatcher machines to fill in potholes.
2. The article does not mention the Isle of Wight or any plans to close potholes there.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary that "potholes on the Isle of Wight are set to be closed for the first time in more than six months" is not supported by the article.
4. Additionally, the phrase "isle of wight are set to be closed" is grammatically incorrect and should be "Isle of Wight is set to be closed" or "potholes on the Isle of Wight are set to be closed".
5. Therefore, the second span in the summary that "isle of wight are set to be closed for the first time in more than six months" is also not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions the Isle of Wight and closing potholes, which are not present in the article.
