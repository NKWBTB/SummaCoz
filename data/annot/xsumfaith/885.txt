    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "team gb's olympic team" but there is no mention of the Olympics or any Olympic team in the article.
2. The summary mentions "the last of the world championships in glasgow" but there is no mention of any world championships or Glasgow in the article.
3. The article is about beaches in Scotland and their water quality, while the summary is about a team and a championship.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions completely different topics and there is no connection between the two.
