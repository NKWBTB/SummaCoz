[
  "team gb\\'s olympic team team gb have been boosted by [UNK] in the last of the world championships in glasgow"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions nothing about an Olympic team or any kind of boost. The article is about the water quality at 26 beaches in Scotland, and it provides pictures of these beaches.
2. The summary mentions "team gb's olympic team" which is not present in the article. The article does not mention any Olympic team or any team called "team gb".
3. The summary also mentions "the last of the world championships in glasgow" which is not present in the article. The article does not mention any world championships or any events taking place in Glasgow.
4. The summary is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of an Olympic team, world championships, or any boost.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it contains several inaccuracies.
