    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man has been charged with the attempted murder of a 14-year-old boy in Cumbria.
2. The article states that the man, Vincent Hudson, has been charged with an historical offence on a boy under the age of 16.
3. The article does not mention attempted murder. Instead, it states that the offence was reported to have taken place in 2001.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions attempted murder, which is not mentioned in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the article does not mention attempted murder, but instead mentions an historical offence on a boy under the age of 16.
