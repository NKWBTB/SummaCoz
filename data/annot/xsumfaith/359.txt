</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "14",
  "attempted murder"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "14": The article states that the victim was under the age of 16, but it does not specify the exact age. The summary, on the other hand, mentions a 14-year-old boy. This is inconsistent because the article does not provide any information about the victim's age being 14.
2. "attempted murder": The article only mentions that Vincent Hudson has been charged with a "historical offence" without specifying the exact nature of the offence. The summary, however, states that he has been charged with "attempted murder". This is inconsistent because the article does not provide any information about attempted murder.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two pieces of information (the victim's age and the nature of the offence) that are not supported by the article.
