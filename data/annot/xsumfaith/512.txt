    Summary: 
    police investigating the rape of an elderly nun in the indian state of west bengal say they have arrested a key suspect in the crime. 

    Article: 
    The police allege 28-year-old Nazrul, also called Nazu, was the man who raped the 74-year-old nun.
The man, allegedly a Bangladeshi citizen, was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta).
The incident caused outrage in India and led to street protests in many cities across the country.
This marks the sixth arrest in the crime.
Police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two still remain untraced.
"All the five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun," a police officer told the BBC.
Dilip Kumar Adak, deputy inspector general of the state's Criminal Investigation Department, told the AFP news agency that police acted on a tip off that Nazu, who had fled to Bangladesh after being identified from CCTV footage of the attack, was due to return to Kolkata by train.
In May, the police said they had arrested Milon Sarkar and described him as the leader of the gang which attacked the convent. They said it was not clear what role the man had played in the case.
During the attack in Ranaghat town on 14 March, money was stolen from the convent school and the building ransacked, before the nun was raped in the convent itself. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the main points of the summary:

* Police have arrested a key suspect in the rape of an elderly nun in West Bengal, India.
* The suspect is a 28-year-old man named Nazrul, who is a Bangladeshi citizen.

Step 2: Identify the main points of the article:

* The police have arrested six people in connection with the rape of the nun, including Nazrul.
* All five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun.
* Nazrul was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata after a tip-off that he was due to return to the city.
* The police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two are still untraced.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies between the summary and the article:

* The summary states that the police have arrested a key suspect, while the article states that the police have arrested six people, including Nazrul.
* The summary does not mention that the other five accused have named Nazrul as the perpetrator, while the article does.
* The summary does not mention that Nazrul was arrested at a railway station or that he was due to return to Kolkata, while the article does.

Step 4: Explain the reasons for the inconsistencies:

* The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one suspect being arrested, while the article states that six people have been arrested.
* The summary does not provide the same level of detail as the article about the other suspects and their involvement in the crime.
* The summary does not mention the tip-off that led to Nazrul's arrest, which is included in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and does not accurately reflect the number of people arrested and the circumstances of their arrests.
