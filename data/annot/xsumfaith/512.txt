<Article>
The police allege 28-year-old Nazrul, also called Nazu, was the man who raped the 74-year-old nun.
The man, allegedly a Bangladeshi citizen, was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta).
The incident caused outrage in India and led to street protests in many cities across the country.
This marks the sixth arrest in the crime.
Police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two still remain untraced.
"All the five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun," a police officer told the BBC.
Dilip Kumar Adak, deputy inspector general of the state's Criminal Investigation Department, told the AFP news agency that police acted on a tip off that Nazu, who had fled to Bangladesh after being identified from CCTV footage of the attack, was due to return to Kolkata by train.
In May, the police said they had arrested Milon Sarkar and described him as the leader of the gang which attacked the convent. They said it was not clear what role the man had played in the case.
During the attack in Ranaghat town on 14 March, money was stolen from the convent school and the building ransacked, before the nun was raped in the convent itself.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "indian state of west bengal"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the rape occurred in Ranaghat town, West Bengal, India.
2. The summary states that the suspect was arrested in "the Indian state of West Bengal."
3. The problem with this statement is that "Indian state of West Bengal" is not a specific location, as West Bengal is a state in India and not a specific location within the state.
4. The article does not mention the specific location where the suspect was arrested, only that he was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta).
5. Therefore, the summary's statement that the suspect was arrested in "the Indian state of West Bengal" is not consistent with the article, as it implies that the suspect was arrested in a specific location within West Bengal, whereas the article does not provide that information.

Overall, the summary's statement about the location of the suspect's arrest is not consistent with the information provided in the article.
