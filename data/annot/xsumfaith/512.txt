The police allege 28-year-old Nazrul, also called Nazu, was the man who raped the 74-year-old nun.
The man, allegedly a Bangladeshi citizen, was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta).
The incident caused outrage in India and led to street protests in many cities across the country.
This marks the sixth arrest in the crime.
Police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two still remain untraced.
"All the five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun," a police officer told the BBC.
Dilip Kumar Adak, deputy inspector general of the state's Criminal Investigation Department, told the AFP news agency that police acted on a tip off that Nazu, who had fled to Bangladesh after being identified from CCTV footage of the attack, was due to return to Kolkata by train.
In May, the police said they had arrested Milon Sarkar and described him as the leader of the gang which attacked the convent. They said it was not clear what role the man had played in the case.
During the attack in Ranaghat town on 14 March, money was stolen from the convent school and the building ransacked, before the nun was raped in the convent itself.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the police have arrested a key suspect in the crime, but the article does not mention any arrest.
2. The article states that the police have identified eight suspects in the attack and have arrested five of them, but the summary does not mention the number of suspects or any arrests.
3. The article mentions that the suspects have been named by the five arrested individuals, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article provides specific details about the attack, such as the location, the amount of money stolen, and the fact that the nun was raped in the convent itself, but the summary does not include any of these details.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any specific information about the arrest, the suspects, or the details of the attack. The summary is too general and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
