<Article>
David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "to boost",
  "warned"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "to boost" - The summary states that the IMF must take steps to boost global demand, but the article does not mention anything about boosting demand. Instead, it talks about the IMF downgrading its forecast for global growth.
2. "warned" - The summary states that the IMF warned about the risk of economic derailment, but the article does not use the word "warned." Instead, it quotes David Lipton as saying that the IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows a weakening baseline and that they are at a delicate juncture.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article. The article does not mention the IMF taking steps to boost demand or using the word "warned."
