<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the international monetary fund (imf) has warned that the global economy faces a growing ``risk of economic derailment\'\'and must take steps to boost global demand. 

    Article: 
    David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the IMF has warned of a growing risk of economic derailment and must take steps to boost global demand, implying that the IMF is advocating for some sort of intervention to stimulate the economy. However, the article states that the IMF is likely to downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth, which suggests that the organization is not advocating for any kind of intervention to boost the economy.
2. The summary mentions the need to boost global demand, but the article focuses on the weakening baseline for the global economy and the ongoing ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story. This suggests that the article is more focused on the current state of the global economy and the challenges it faces, rather than on finding solutions to boost demand.
3. The summary does not provide any specific information about the risks facing the global economy, while the article provides details about the weaker-than-expected trade figures from China and the IMF's likely downgrade of its growth forecast. This suggests that the summary is not supported by the specific information provided in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it presents a different message and focus than the article. While the summary suggests that the IMF is advocating for intervention to boost the economy, the article focuses on the current challenges facing the global economy and the ongoing ramifications for businesses and industries. Additionally, the summary does not provide specific information to support its claims, while the article provides details about the weaker-than-expected trade figures from China and the IMF's likely downgrade of its growth forecast.
