</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "you\\'ve been using your questions to tell us what you want to know about the west midlands"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is about a new law allowing dogs to eat at outdoor restaurants in the West Midlands.
2. The summary states "you've been using your questions to tell us what you want to know about the west midlands." This statement is not related to the topic of the article at all.
3. The article does not mention anything about using questions to learn about the West Midlands. The article is focused solely on the new law allowing dogs to eat at outdoor restaurants.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not supported by the article and is inconsistent with the content of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a new topic (using questions to learn about the West Midlands) that is not present in the article.
