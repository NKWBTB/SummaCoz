     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the questions are being used to tell us what we want to know about the West Midlands, but the article does not mention anything about questions.
2. The article is about a new law allowing dogs to eat at restaurants outdoors, but the summary does not mention anything about dogs or restaurants.
3. The article includes a clip of a puppy platter, but the summary does not mention anything about a platter or a puppy.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
