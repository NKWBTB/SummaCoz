    Summary: 
    a post-mortem examination has concluded that a man died from measles and measles. 

    Article: 
    Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died last week at his home in Swansea, the city at the centre of an epidemic of the disease which has reached 942 cases.
But the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of his death.
An inquest will be opened and adjourned on Tuesday to allow further tests.
Since the outbreak began in November, 83 people have needed hospital treatment for the illness.
Mr Colfer-Williams' mother, Angela Colfer said her son had recently been treated at Swansea's Morriston Hospital for asthma.
A few days after he was discharged he became unwell and developed a rash.
Mrs Colfer said her son went to see an out-of-hours GP on 17 April with a rash "from head to foot" but not on his arms.
The following morning, Mr Colfer-Williams was found dead at his flat.
Public Health Wales said on Friday that laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of measles but further tests were needed to determine the cause of death.
The family said they had no idea how Mr Colfer-Williams got measles as no close family member has it, including his three-year-old daughter who has been vaccinated. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the post-mortem examination concluded that the man died from measles and measles, but the article states that the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of his death. This is a contradiction, as the summary states that measles was the cause of death, but the article states that the cause is unknown.

2. The article states that the inquest will be opened and adjourned to allow further tests, indicating that the cause of death has not been determined. This contradicts the summary, which states that the man died from measles and measles.

3. The article mentions that the man had been treated for asthma at the hospital, and that he developed a rash after being discharged. This is not mentioned in the summary.

4. The summary states that the family had no idea how the man got measles, but the article states that laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of measles. This is a contradiction, as the summary states that the family had no idea how the man got measles, but the article states that he did have measles.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be incorrect in several key points.
