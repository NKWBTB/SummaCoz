<Article>
Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died last week at his home in Swansea, the city at the centre of an epidemic of the disease which has reached 942 cases.
But the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of his death.
An inquest will be opened and adjourned on Tuesday to allow further tests.
Since the outbreak began in November, 83 people have needed hospital treatment for the illness.
Mr Colfer-Williams' mother, Angela Colfer said her son had recently been treated at Swansea's Morriston Hospital for asthma.
A few days after he was discharged he became unwell and developed a rash.
Mrs Colfer said her son went to see an out-of-hours GP on 17 April with a rash "from head to foot" but not on his arms.
The following morning, Mr Colfer-Williams was found dead at his flat.
Public Health Wales said on Friday that laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of measles but further tests were needed to determine the cause of death.
The family said they had no idea how Mr Colfer-Williams got measles as no close family member has it, including his three-year-old daughter who has been vaccinated.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the post-mortem examination concluded that the man died from measles and measles.
2. However, the article states that the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of death.
3. The article also states that further tests are needed to determine the cause of death.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it claims that the post-mortem examination concluded that the man died from measles and measles, while the article states that the cause of death is still unknown.
5. The discrepancy between the summary and the article suggests that the summary is incorrect or misleading.
6. The article provides information that the man had been treated for asthma and had developed a rash before his death, but the summary does not mention these details.
7. The article also states that the family had no idea how the man got measles, as no close family members have the disease, including his three-year-old daughter who has been vaccinated.
8. Therefore, the summary is not only inconsistent with the article but also lacks important information that is provided in the article.
