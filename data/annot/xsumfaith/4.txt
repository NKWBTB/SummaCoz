<Article>
Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died last week at his home in Swansea, the city at the centre of an epidemic of the disease which has reached 942 cases.
But the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of his death.
An inquest will be opened and adjourned on Tuesday to allow further tests.
Since the outbreak began in November, 83 people have needed hospital treatment for the illness.
Mr Colfer-Williams' mother, Angela Colfer said her son had recently been treated at Swansea's Morriston Hospital for asthma.
A few days after he was discharged he became unwell and developed a rash.
Mrs Colfer said her son went to see an out-of-hours GP on 17 April with a rash "from head to foot" but not on his arms.
The following morning, Mr Colfer-Williams was found dead at his flat.
Public Health Wales said on Friday that laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of measles but further tests were needed to determine the cause of death.
The family said they had no idea how Mr Colfer-Williams got measles as no close family member has it, including his three-year-old daughter who has been vaccinated.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "a post-mortem examination has concluded that a man died from measles and measles",
  NaN
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of his death." This implies that the cause of death is not yet determined and further tests are needed.
2. The summary states that "a post-mortem examination has concluded that a man died from measles and measles." This is inconsistent with the article, as the article states that the cause of death is not yet determined.
3. The summary also states that "a post-mortem examination has concluded" which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that an inquest will be opened and adjourned to allow further tests, but it does not mention the results of any post-mortem examination.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it claims that the cause of death has been determined when the article states that further tests are needed to determine the cause of death.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
