    Summary: 
    a flintshire man has admitted telling an american crisis line he was planning to kill himself and take as many police with him as he could. 

    Article: 
    Craig Hughes, 33, of Flint, was arrested by North Wales Police in August after he chatted online with the Hope Line Crisis Centre in Tennessee.
Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non-existent crime.
Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday.
He will be sentenced next week.
Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene, prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings.
He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary.
The threats were made on two occasions, late at night, while Hughes was drunk.
Judge Niclas Parry, who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009, remanded him in custody pending sentence.
During a previous hearing, Hughes's legal team said he had not intended to kill himself and would not have carried out any threat to kill police officers.
The court heard at the time, North Wales Police was particularly concerned because the defendant was on bail, awaiting trial for firearms offences, of which he was subsequently cleared.
The Hope Line centre offers confidential support and counselling to people experiencing difficulty. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man admitted telling an American crisis line he was planning to kill himself and take as many police with him as he could. However, the article does not mention anything about the man admitting to planning to kill himself. Instead, it states that he made threats to kill police officers.
2. The summary also states that the man made these threats to the American crisis line, but the article does not mention anything about the man contacting an American crisis line. Instead, it states that he chatted online with the Hope Line Crisis Centre in Tennessee.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the man being on bail awaiting trial for firearms offenses, which is mentioned in the article.
4. The article states that the man's legal team said he had not intended to kill himself and would not have carried out any threat to kill police officers, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary exaggerates the man's admission and includes information that is not present in the article.
