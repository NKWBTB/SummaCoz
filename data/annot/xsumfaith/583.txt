<Article>
Craig Hughes, 33, of Flint, was arrested by North Wales Police in August after he chatted online with the Hope Line Crisis Centre in Tennessee.
Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non-existent crime.
Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday.
He will be sentenced next week.
Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene, prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings.
He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary.
The threats were made on two occasions, late at night, while Hughes was drunk.
Judge Niclas Parry, who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009, remanded him in custody pending sentence.
During a previous hearing, Hughes's legal team said he had not intended to kill himself and would not have carried out any threat to kill police officers.
The court heard at the time, North Wales Police was particularly concerned because the defendant was on bail, awaiting trial for firearms offences, of which he was subsequently cleared.
The Hope Line centre offers confidential support and counselling to people experiencing difficulty.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Craig Hughes, a 33-year-old man from Flint, was arrested by North Wales Police in August after he chatted online with the Hope Line Crisis Centre in Tennessee.
2. The article does not mention anything about Hughes telling the crisis center that he was planning to kill himself or take police officers with him.
3. The summary states that Hughes admitted telling an American crisis line he was planning to kill himself and take as many police with him as he could. This is not supported by the article.
4. The word "American" in the summary is also not accurate, as the Hope Line Crisis Centre is based in Tennessee, which is not a part of America.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not supported by the article and contains inaccuracies.

Overall, the summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
