     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Great Britain's eventers missed out on a bronze medal, but the article does not mention any medals for Great Britain.
2. The summary mentions losing in the dressage, but the article does not mention dressage as one of the phases of the event.
3. The summary does not mention the names of any specific riders or horses, while the article mentions several riders and their horses by name.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article does not mention Great Britain missing out on a bronze medal, and it does not focus on the dressage phase of the event. Additionally, the summary does not provide any specific details about the riders or horses mentioned in the article.
