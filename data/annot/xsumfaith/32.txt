    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the main points of the summary

The summary states that the Belfast Giants came from behind to beat the Nottingham Panthers 5-2 in the first game of their Elite League campaign.

Step 2: Identify the main points of the article

The article states that the Giants got a short-handed opener through player-coach Derrick Walser, but Jeff Dimmen pulled the Panthers level. In the second period, Mike Forney's powerplay breakaway goal made it 2-1, and Andy Bohmbach equalized. Mike Radja scored from an acute angle, and James Desmarais made it 4-2 before Nottingham's David Ling got one back.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary states that the Giants came from behind to beat the Panthers 5-2, but the article does not mention a final score of 5-2. Instead, the article states that the Giants were leading 4-2 before Nottingham's David Ling got one back.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistencies

The inconsistency between the summary and the article is that the summary states a final score of 5-2, while the article does not mention such a score. Instead, the article states that the Giants were leading 4-2 before Nottingham scored another goal. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
