1. The summary states that the Belfast Giants came from behind to beat the Nottingham Panthers 5-2.
2. However, the article states that the Panthers equalized the score at 2-2 and the Giants went on to win 4-2.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the score or the outcome of the game.
4. The article mentions that the Giants got a short-handed opener, but the summary does not include this information.
5. The summary also does not mention the powerplay breakaway goal by Mike Forney, the equalizing goal by Andy Bohmback, or the acute angle goal by Mike Radja.
6. Therefore, the summary is not a consistent summary of the article and contains important information that is not present in the article.
