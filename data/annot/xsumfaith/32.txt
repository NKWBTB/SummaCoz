Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Giants got a short-handed opener, but the summary claims that the Giants came from behind to beat the Panthers. This is inconsistent, as the Giants never trailed in the game.
2. The article states that Jeff Dimmen pulled the Panthers level, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as Dimmen's goal was a key moment in the game.
3. The article states that Mike Forney scored a powerplay breakaway goal, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as Forney's goal was a significant event in the game.
4. The article states that Andy Bohmback equalized, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as Bohmback's goal was a key moment in the game.
5. The article states that Mike Radja scored from an acute angle, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as Radja's goal was a notable event in the game.
6. The article states that James Desmarais made it 4-2, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as Desmarais' goal was a key moment in the game.
7. The article states that Nottingham's David Ling got one back, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as Ling's goal was a significant event in the game.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, as it omits key details and presents a different narrative.
