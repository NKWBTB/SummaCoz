     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the article is about people being judged based on their last haircut, but the article does not support this claim. The article actually focuses on sports stars with unusual or poor haircuts.
2. The summary mentions nothing about sports stars or haircuts, which are the main topics of the article.
3. The summary's reference to "last haircut" is not present in the article, and the article does not discuss the idea that people are only as good as their last haircut.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
