Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary statement "some people say you are only as good as your last haircut" is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the relationship between a person's haircut and their performance or worth.
2. The article is focused on showcasing various sporting hairstyles that have gone wrong or are considered unconventional, rather than discussing the impact of haircuts on performance.
3. The article does not provide any evidence or quotes from "some people" who believe that a person's last haircut determines their worth or performance.
4. Therefore, the summary statement is not consistent with the content of the article and should be revised or clarified to accurately reflect the information presented in the article.
