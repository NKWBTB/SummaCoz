</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states, "some people say you are only as good as your last haircut."
2. However, the article provides examples of athletes with poor haircuts who still achieved success in their respective sports.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not support the idea that a person's last haircut determines their worth or abilities.

The article presents various examples of athletes with unusual or poorly received haircuts who still achieved success in their sports, contradicting the idea that a person's last haircut is a reflection of their worth or abilities. The summary's statement is therefore not supported by the article's content.
