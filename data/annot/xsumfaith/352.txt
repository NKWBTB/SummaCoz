A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded.
Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.
But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win.
The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.
Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.
In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties.
More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up.
However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break.
Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.
England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

<Summary>
gloucester maintained their 100% start to the european champions cup with a bonus-point win over gloucester at kingsholm.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Gloucester maintained a 100% start to the European Champions Cup, which is not consistent with the article. The article states that Gloucester won the game 23-20, but the summary implies that they won all of their games in the competition so far, which is not true.
2. The summary also states that Gloucester won the game with a bonus point, which is not accurate. The article does not mention anything about a bonus point.
3. The summary does not provide any specific information about the game, such as the scores or the players who scored. The article provides detailed information about the game, including the scores and the players who scored tries.
4. The summary is very brief and does not provide any context or background information about the game. The article provides more detailed information about the game, including the teams' previous results and the players' performances.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article and does not provide accurate or detailed information about the game. It is a very brief and misleading summary that does not reflect the content of the article.
