A Gareth Anscombe drop-goal edged Blues 23-20 ahead after Gloucester Josh Hohneck was yellow carded.
Alex Cuthbert had helped level the scores after the sin-binning, scoring his second try after Ross Moriarty and Tom Marshall scores put the hosts up.
But unanswered second-half tries from Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy sealed Gloucester's win.
The Cherry and Whites, who went out at home at the quarter-final stage last year, won the competition in 2015.
Defeat for the Blues means they have failed to progress beyond the last eight of any European Cup competition since winning the continent's second-tier title in 2010.
In a seesawing opening 40 minutes, scores were locked on four separate occasions, with Cuthbert and Moriarty trading tries before Blues' Steven Shingler and Gloucester's Billy Burns swapped penalties.
More of the same followed when Billy Twelvetrees took over kicking duties from Burns, following a head injury, as both sides landed further penalties and Marshall's first try put Gloucester 20-13 up.
However, Blues racked up 10 points while Gloucester were a man down to take a three-point advantage into the break.
Shingler extended that lead to six, but that is as good as it would get for the Pro12 side, who had Wales' Sam Warburton at blind-side flanker after impressing in the position for Wales during the Six Nations Championship.
England coach Eddie Jones was in the stands at Kingholm to see May, the only Gloucester player he called upon for their triumphant Six Nations campaign, cross for the first of the hosts' four second-half scores to seal an ultimately convincing win that sees them progress to play La Rochelle - a side they met twice and beat once in the group stage this term.

<Summary>
gloucester maintained their 100% start to the european champions cup with a bonus-point win over gloucester at kingsholm.
</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "win over gloucester",
  "maintained their 100% start to the european champions cup with a bonus-point",
  "kingsholm"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "win over gloucester" - The article does not mention a "win over Gloucester." Instead, it states that Gloucester won the match.

2. "maintained their 100% start to the european champions cup with a bonus-point" - The article does not mention Gloucester maintaining a 100% start to the European Champions Cup. In fact, the article states that Gloucester won the match, but it does not mention anything about their start to the competition.

3. "kingsholm" - The article does not mention "Kingsholm." The venue for the match was Kingston Park, not Kingsholm.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains three errors:

* It incorrectly states that Gloucester won the match, when in fact the article states that Gloucester won.
* It incorrectly states that Gloucester maintained a 100% start to the European Champions Cup, when in fact the article does not mention anything about their start to the competition.
* It incorrectly states that the match was played at Kingsholm, when in fact it was played at Kingston Park.
