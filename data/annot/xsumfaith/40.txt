The former Manchester City man, 30, won 61 caps for England after making his senior debut in 2009.
He was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships but played just three minutes at Euro 2016.
"The decision we've reached is about common sense. I wish Sam [Allardyce], the players, staff and supporters success in the future," Milner said.
Milner also holds the record for the most capped England Under-21 player, picking up 46 caps after making his first appearance in 2004.
He scored his first, and only, international goal in England's 5-0 victory over Moldova at the 2014 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.
