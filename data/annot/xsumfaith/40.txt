<Article>
The former Manchester City man, 30, won 61 caps for England after making his senior debut in 2009.
He was a squad member at two World Cups and two European Championships but played just three minutes at Euro 2016.
"The decision we've reached is about common sense. I wish Sam [Allardyce], the players, staff and supporters success in the future," Milner said.
Milner also holds the record for the most capped England Under-21 player, picking up 46 caps after making his first appearance in 2004.
He scored his first, and only, international goal in England's 5-0 victory over Moldova at the 2014 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "england midfielder james milner has announced his retirement from international football with the republic of ireland"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that James Milner has played for England, not the Republic of Ireland.

2. The summary claims that Milner has announced his retirement from international football with the Republic of Ireland.

3. This information is inconsistent with the article, as the article does not mention Milner retiring from international football or playing for the Republic of Ireland.

4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistency is in the statement that Milner has announced his retirement from international football with the Republic of Ireland.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
