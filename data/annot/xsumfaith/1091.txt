    Summary: 
    west ham say they have made a takeover offer for the chinese energy firm sullivan. 

    Article: 
    It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club.
Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.
Between them they now own more than 85% of the club.
Since August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
Last year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that West Ham has made a takeover offer for the Chinese energy firm Sullivan. However, the article does not mention anything about West Ham making a takeover offer for Sullivan. Instead, it mentions that Sullivan and Gold, the current owners of West Ham, have been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
2. The article states that Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010, and that they now own more than 85% of the club. This suggests that they have a significant amount of control over the club and would not need to make a takeover offer for Sullivan.
3. The article also mentions that Sullivan has said that it is possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts, but that he and Gold intend the ownership to pass on to their children. This suggests that Sullivan and Gold are not looking to sell their majority stake in the club.
4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is not consistent with the summary statement that West Ham has made a takeover offer for Sullivan. The summary statement is incorrect and should be revised to reflect the correct information.
