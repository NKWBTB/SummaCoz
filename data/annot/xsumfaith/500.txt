Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of shooting a female student dead and wounding another at a school in India.
2. However, the article states that the alleged gunman, Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school and barged into the room of 18-year-old Gautami and shot her in the head with a pistol on Tuesday evening.
3. The article does not mention anything about the man being arrested on suspicion of the shooting. Instead, it states that Mahesh was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events described in the article. Specifically, it does not mention the name of the alleged gunman, Mahesh, or the fact that he was an office assistant in the school.
5. Additionally, the summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of shooting a female student dead, but the article does not mention the word "suspicion." Instead, it states that Mahesh was arrested after a manhunt.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events described in the article and includes words and phrases that are not present in the article.
