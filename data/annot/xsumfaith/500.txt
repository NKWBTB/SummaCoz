<Article>
The shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School in Bangalore city.
Police say the alleged gunman, identified as Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school.
Incidents of gun crime at schools and colleges in India are very rare. It is not clear what prompted the shooting.
Police said on Thursday that Mahesh had been remanded until 12 April.
Mahesh is alleged to have barged into the room of 18-year-old Gautami and shot her in the head with a pistol on on Tuesday evening.
He then shot another student, Sirisha, who suffered severe injuries but is believed to be out of danger, say police.
He was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt.
India has strict control laws, although a large number of feuds are settled with firearms.
In 2007, a 14-year-old schoolboy was shot dead by two fellow students at a school campus near the capital, Delhi.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "dead" - The article states that one of the students, Gautami, was shot in the head and is believed to be dead, but the summary only mentions that she was "shot dead". This is a consistency issue because the summary should match the language used in the article.
2. "india" - The article mentions that the shooting took place in Bangalore city, India, but the summary simply says "in india". This is a consistency issue because the summary should provide more specific information about the location of the shooting.
3. "at a school" - The article states that the shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School, but the summary only mentions "at a school". This is a consistency issue because the summary should provide more specific information about the location of the shooting.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article, and there are consistency issues with the language and specificity of the information presented.
