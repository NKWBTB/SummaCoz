    Summary: 
    braintree boss steve cowley says his side\'s 1-0 victory over barrow in the national league was " remarkable ". 

    Article: 
    The Iron are currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots.
"I thought we asked a lot of questions of a very good Barrow team," Cowley told BBC Essex.
"When you come off the back of a six or seven-hour journey and you concede a goal after five minutes it's always going to be tough."
Barrow extended their unbeaten league run to nine games with the victory, and although Braintree's losing run extended to three games, Cowley remained positive.
"What we've done so far has been nothing short of remarkable," he continued. "But if anyone thought this journey was going to be easy, then they're living in cloud cuckoo land.
"We're a part-time team. This is our toughest challenge to date, but we're going to embrace it. We're going to enjoy it and see where it takes us." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Steve Cowley, the Braintree boss, called the team's 1-0 victory over Barrow "remarkable."
2. However, the article states that Braintree lost the game 1-0, not that they won.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not support the claim that Braintree won the game or that their victory was "remarkable."

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the summary incorrectly states that Braintree won the game, when in fact they lost.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Steve Cowley, the Braintree boss, called the team's 1-0 victory over Barrow "remarkable."
2. However, the article states that Braintree lost the game, not that they won.
3. The summary states that Steve Cowley is the Braintree boss. However, the article does not mention Cowley's first name as Steve.
