<Article>
Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.
So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it.
Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online.
The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.

<Summary>
scientists in the pacific ocean say they have discovered the largest known sighting of the pacific ocean.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the team is exploring the Mariana Trench, which is known to be up to 11 kilometers deep.
2. The summary claims that scientists have discovered the largest known sighting in the Pacific Ocean.
3. The article does not mention any discoveries or sightings of this magnitude. Instead, it mentions the team's goal of exploring the trench and finding fish, mud volcanoes, and deep sea coral.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it makes a much more dramatic claim about a discovery that is not supported by the article.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the discovery made by the team and claims something that is not mentioned in the article.
