Find out why.

<Article>
Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.
So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it.
Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online.
The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.

  "scientists in the pacific ocean say they have discovered the largest known sighting of the pacific ocean"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the team is exploring the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean to discover more about the deep-sea ecosystem.
2. The article does not mention any discoveries of large sightings or any record-breaking finds. Instead, it focuses on the team's efforts to explore the trench and document the sea life they encounter.
3. The summary statement "scientists in the pacific ocean say they have discovered the largest known sighting of the pacific ocean" is not supported by the article. There is no mention of any such discovery or record-breaking find in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement is not accurate.

So, the consistency issue in the summary is that it makes a claim about a discovery that is not supported by the article.
