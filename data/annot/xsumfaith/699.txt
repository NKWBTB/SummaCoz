    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has been found not guilty of the manslaughter of his mother\'s partner who died after falling and hitting his head on the ground at a holiday park. 

    Article: 
    Ken Dickie, 64, died in hospital on 14 May, six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole.
Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother.
He shouted "yes" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court.
The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a "down phase" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May.
In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got "tanked up" on alcohol.
The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public.
Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight.
He and his mother Samantha, 57, also of Apple Close, also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events.
The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr Dickie had pushed Mrs Mitchell and she had pushed him back.
But Mr Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing what he described as a "tragic accident".
The pair will be sentenced on 6 February. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was found not guilty of manslaughter, but the article states that he had pleaded guilty to common assault and attempting to pervert the course of justice. This is inconsistent, as the man should have been found guilty of at least one of these charges if he was involved in the altercation that led to the victim's death.
2. The article states that the man and his mother had been in a "down phase" in their relationship, and that they had been drinking heavily before the altercation. This is not mentioned in the summary, which implies that the man was not involved in the victim's death.
3. The article states that the man had tried to push the couple apart, which led to the victim's death. This is not mentioned in the summary, which implies that the man was not responsible for the victim's death.
4. The article states that the man and his mother had lied to the police about the course of events, which is not mentioned in the summary. This is an important detail that suggests the man and his mother were trying to cover up their involvement in the victim's death.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides more details and evidence about the man's involvement in the victim's death, and the inconsistencies between the two suggest that the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
