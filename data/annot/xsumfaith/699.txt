Find out why.

<Article>
Ken Dickie, 64, died in hospital on 14 May, six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole.
Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother.
He shouted "yes" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court.
The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a "down phase" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May.
In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got "tanked up" on alcohol.
The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public.
Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight.
He and his mother Samantha, 57, also of Apple Close, also admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events.
The court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr Dickie had pushed Mrs Mitchell and she had pushed him back.
But Mr Mitchell later told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing what he described as a "tragic accident".
The pair will be sentenced on 6 February.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "falling and hitting his head on the ground": The article states that Mr. Dickie died six days after the incident at the Rockley Park site in Poole, but it does not mention him falling and hitting his head on the ground. Instead, it says that he died after being pushed by Jamie Mitchell. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "not guilty of the manslaughter": The article states that Jamie Mitchell pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight, but it does not mention him being found not guilty of manslaughter. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. "holiday": The article does not mention anything about a holiday. The incident occurred at a park, but it is not described as a holiday park. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. "not guilty of the manslaughter of his mother's partner": The article states that Jamie Mitchell pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight, but it does not mention him being found not guilty of manslaughter. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, including the cause of Mr. Dickie's death, the charges against Jamie Mitchell, and the location of the incident.
