The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, but the summary only mentions that she was hit by an elephant at a zoo in Rabat, Texas. This is inconsistent because the article provides more information about the girl's fate, while the summary only provides a brief summary of the incident.
2. The article mentions that the zoo stated that the enclosure met international standards and that this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable, and unusual. The summary does not include this information.
3. The article quotes Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, as saying that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual and that it can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. The summary does not include this information.
4. The article includes a video showing the moments after the girl was struck, which is not included in the summary.

Overall, the summary does not provide a consistent summary of the article because it leaves out important details about the girl's fate, the zoo's statement, and the expert's opinion. Additionally, the summary contains inaccurate information (the girl did not die in Rabat, Texas, but in a hospital after being taken there).
