The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "texas",
  "12-year-old"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident occurred at a zoo in Rabat, Morocco, not Texas. The summary incorrectly locates the incident in Texas.
2. The article does not mention the age of the girl, so the summary's reference to a "12-year-old girl" is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the two spans in the summary that have consistency issues are:

* "texas" (should be "Rabat, Morocco")
* "12-year-old" (not mentioned in the article)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
