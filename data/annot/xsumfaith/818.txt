    Summary: 
    a 12-year-old girl has died after being hit by a elephant at a zoo in rabat, rabat, texas. 

    Article: 
    The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a 12-year-old girl died after being hit by an elephant at a zoo in Rabat, Texas. However, there is no mention of a zoo in Rabat, Texas in the article.
2. The article states that the girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, but the summary does not mention this detail.
3. The article states that the zoo said the enclosure met international standards and that this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable, and unusual. The summary does not include this information.
4. The article mentions that the Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, Phyllis Lee, said that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual and that it can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. The summary does not include this information.
5. The article mentions that a bystander filmed the moments after the girl was struck and uploaded the video onto YouTube, but the summary does not mention this detail.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary includes details that are not present in the article, and omits important information that is included in the article. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article.
