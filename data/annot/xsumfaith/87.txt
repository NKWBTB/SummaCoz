    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my step-by-step explanation of why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "Oscar-winning oscar winner," which is an inconsistency because the article does not mention anything about the stars winning Oscars.
2. The summary mentions "Oscar-winning actress," which is inconsistent because the article only mentions Emma Watson being cast as Belle, and does not mention any other actors winning Oscars.
3. The summary mentions "Oscar-winning oscar winner," which is a repetition of the previous inconsistency.
4. The summary mentions "Kevin Kline," which is inconsistent because the article only mentions Kevin Kline as co-starring in the film, but does not mention him as an Oscar winner.
5. The summary mentions "Mrs Potts," which is inconsistent because the article only mentions Mrs. Potts as a character in the film, but does not mention her being voiced by Dame Angela Lansbury.
6. The summary mentions "US cinemas," which is inconsistent because the article only mentions the film being released in cinemas, without specifying the location.
7. The summary mentions "Harry Potter star Emma Watson," which is consistent with the article, but the following sentence "Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens will play the Beast" is inconsistent because the article only mentions Dan Stevens as co-starring in the film, but does not mention him playing the Beast.
8. The summary mentions "Luke Evans," which is consistent with the article, but the following sentence "Josh Gad" is inconsistent because the article only mentions Josh Gad as co-starring in the film, but does not mention him as Gaston's sidekick.
9. The summary mentions "Bill Condon," which is consistent with the article, but the following sentence "the last two Twilight films" is inconsistent because the article only mentions Bill Condon as the director of the film, without specifying any other films he has directed.

Therefore, the given summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inconsistencies and inaccuracies, such as mentioning Oscar winners, repeating the same information, and mentioning characters and actors who are not mentioned in the article.
