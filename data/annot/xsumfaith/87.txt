Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The first red flag is the repeated use of the phrase "Oscar-winning" in the summary. The article only mentions that the actors have won Oscars once, but the summary exaggerates this by repeating the phrase multiple times.
2. The second red flag is the lack of specific information about the actors' roles in the summary. The article provides detailed information about each actor's role, but the summary only mentions the actors' names without any context.
3. The third red flag is the inconsistency in the use of names. The article uses the actors' full names (Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Josh Gad), but the summary only uses their last names (Watson, Stevens, Evans, Gad).
4. The fourth red flag is the lack of information about the film's release date. The article mentions that the film will be released on March 17, 2017, but the summary does not include this information.

Based on these red flags, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is exaggerated, lacks specific information about the actors' roles, and does not include important details about the film's release date. Therefore, the summary cannot be trusted as an accurate summary of the article.
