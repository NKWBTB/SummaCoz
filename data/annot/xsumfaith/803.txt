<Article>
The Australian, 21, beat world number 29 Querrey 6-4 6-4 in 53 minutes to progress to the second round.
Kyrgios, ranked a career-high 12th in the world, won the Japan Open on Sunday and is closing in on the top 10.
"I was just a bit bored at times," said Kyrgios, when asked why he was not his usual vocal self against Querrey.
"I was feeling very tired. It was just tough. I'm just tired so maybe I just wanted to get the job done."
Kyrgios said his success in Japan, and the travelling involved in playing at the Qi Zhong Stadium, an hour from Shanghai city centre, had taken its toll.
"I didn't have the greatest sleep last night and obviously got in late the day before," he said. "The ride to the courts isn't great either."
It was at the Shanghai Masters last year that Kyrgios was fined $1,500 (Â£984) for a foul-mouthed outburst, describing the tournament a "circus".

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "made history",
  "mark",
  "history in the first round",
  "world number one",
  "of the shanghai masters",
  "history in the first round of the shanghai masters",
  "one mark"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "made history" - The article does not mention that Kyrgios "made history" in the first round of the Shanghai Masters. While he did win the tournament and achieved a career-high ranking, there is no mention of him making history.
2. "mark" - The article does not use the word "mark" to refer to Kyrgios. The correct name of the tennis player is Nick Kyrgios, not "mark."
3. "history in the first round" - The article does not mention that Kyrgios made history in the first round of the Shanghai Masters. While he did win the tournament, there is no mention of him making history in the first round specifically.
4. "world number one" - The article does not mention that Kyrgios is the "world number one." While he is ranked 12th in the world, there is no mention of him being the number one player.
5. "of the shanghai masters" - The article does not mention the "shanghai masters" in this context. The correct phrase is "Shanghai Masters."
6. "history in the first round of the shanghai masters" - This phrase is a combination of two incorrect statements. The article does not mention that Kyrgios made history in the first round, and it does not mention the "shanghai masters" in this context.
7. "one mark" - The article does not use the phrase "one mark" to refer to Kyrgios. The correct name of the tennis player is Nick Kyrgios.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations.
