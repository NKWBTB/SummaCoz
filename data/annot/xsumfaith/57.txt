    Summary: 
    wales and ospreys scrum-half rhys webb says he is still waiting to be fit for wales \'pre-season tour. 

    Article: 
    Webb has not played since suffering a serious foot injury in a World Cup warm-up with Italy in September.
The 27-year-old says he is close to a return, giving him time to get fit before the Six Nations in February.
"I'm back up and running now and going through a pre-season sort of stage at the moment. It's all coming along well," he said.
"I'm going to take each week as it comes now and see where I am then.
"It's been talked about [returning] at the beginning of February, but I did ask the physios if they could scrape a couple of weeks off that and they said 'yes'."
Wales begin their Six Nations campaign away to Ireland in Dublin on Sunday, 7 February.
Webb, capped 16 times by Wales, has renewed his national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union.
He turned down offers from elsewhere to stay at the region for whom he made his debut in 2007.
"It's my home region and I enjoy the club," Webb told BBC Wales' Scrum V Live.
"I want to put myself in the best possible position to play for my country and I'm not going to give that up that easy.
"Wales and the Ospreys came together and I'm happy to get it done." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Rhys Webb is waiting to be fit for Wales' pre-season tour, but the article states that he is close to a return and has already started his pre-season training. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary mentions a pre-season tour, but the article does not mention any pre-season tour. Instead, it mentions the Six Nations campaign, which starts on February 7th. This suggests that the summary is not accurate.
3. The summary states that Rhys Webb is waiting to be fit for Wales' pre-season tour, but the article states that he is close to a return and has already started his pre-season training. This implies that Webb is already fit and does not need to wait for a pre-season tour.
4. The article states that Webb has renewed his national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union, but the summary does not mention this. This suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's content.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a pre-season tour that is not mentioned in the article, and it implies that Webb is not fit when the article states that he is close to a return. Additionally, the summary does not include information about Webb's contract renewal, which is mentioned in the article.
