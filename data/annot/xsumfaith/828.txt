Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is about a collision that occurred in Lincolnshire, England, specifically on the B1191 road at Thornton, near Woodhall Spa.
2. The summary states that the collision occurred in "east sussex", which is a different location from Lincolnshire.
3. The article does not mention anything about east sussex, so the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The word "east sussex" is not supported by any information in the article, and it is not a correct description of the location where the collision occurred.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it contains incorrect information.

Overall, the inconsistency in the summary is due to the incorrect location mentioned in the summary, which is not supported by the article.
