    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a motorcyclist has been killed in a collision with a tractor driver in east sussex, police have said. 

    Article: 
    The crash happened at about 14:15 BST on the B1191 at Thornton, near Woodhall Spa.
Lincolnshire Police said the motorcyclist killed in the collision lived locally, but has not released any further details. The tractor driver was not injured.
The force has appealed for witnesses to the collision to come forward.
The B1191 was closed in both directions between the B1192 Tattershall Road junction in Woodhall Spa and the A158 Jubilee Way junction in Horncastle 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the collision occurred in East Sussex, but the article states that it happened in Lincolnshire. This is not consistent.
2. The summary mentions the motorcyclist being killed, but the article does not confirm this. Instead, it states that the motorcyclist lived locally but does not provide any further details about their condition.
3. The summary states that the tractor driver was not injured, but the article does not mention this. It only states that the force has appealed for witnesses to the collision to come forward.
4. The summary mentions the B1191 being closed in both directions, but the article does not mention this. It only states that the collision happened on the B1191 at Thornton.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and should not be relied upon as an accurate summary of the content.
