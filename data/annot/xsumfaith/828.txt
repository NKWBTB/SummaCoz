</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the collision occurred in Lincolnshire, specifically on the B1191 at Thornton, near Woodhall Spa.
2. The summary states that the collision occurred in East Sussex.
3. These two locations are not the same, and therefore the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The article does not mention anything about East Sussex, and the location of the collision is clearly stated as Lincolnshire.
5. Therefore, the summary is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the information in the article.
