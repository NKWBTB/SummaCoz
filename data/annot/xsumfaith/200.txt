Ms Wallström said she had spoken with Mr Gustafsson, who she described as being "happy" and "overwhelmed" by Monday's events.
"I cannot say more at the current time," she added.
Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that Mr Gustafsson's kidnapping weighed heavily on his mind during his time in the role, which ended in 2014.

AQIM took a number of Western hostages before the French military deployed its forces in January 2013.
In a separate incident in December 2014, French hostage Serge Lazarevic was freed after a prisoner swap. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Sweden's Foreign Minister Johan Gustafsson has been freed after being kidnapped by Islamist militants in Mali. However, the article does not mention anything about Gustafsson being freed. Instead, it states that he is being flown back to Sweden from Africa.
2. The summary mentions that Gustafsson was kidnapped by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), but the article does not mention AQIM as the group responsible for the kidnapping. Instead, it states that Gustafsson was seized by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb along with two other men.
3. The summary states that Gustafsson is "in good spirits", but the article does not mention anything about his physical or mental state.
4. The summary mentions that the Swede's release was thanks to "extensive efforts" and co-operation between the Swedish foreign ministry, police and "foreign authorities", but the article does not provide any details about the efforts made to secure Gustafsson's release.
5. Finally, the summary mentions that Gustafsson was kidnapped along with two other men, but the article only mentions one other man, Stephen McGown, who was freed in a dawn raid in 2015.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
