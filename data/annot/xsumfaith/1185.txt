The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found the number had gone up by 200 million since 2013.
There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in the last few years, many of them can't be recycled and are often thrown away after they have been used.
The bags end up in rubbish dumps and even rivers causing big problems for the environment.
From October people in England will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in a bid to encourage them to reuse the ones that they already have.
Supermarkets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where people are charged for carrier bags, have all seen a decrease in bags used.
Campaigners are hoping the charge in England will lessen the amount of bags being thrown away, helping the environment.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England has gone up by 200 million since 2013. This means that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England has increased, not decreased.
2. The summary states that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England last year has more than doubled in the last year. This is not supported by the article, as the article states that the number has gone up by 200 million since 2013, not that it has doubled in the last year.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides incorrect information about the number of plastic bags thrown away in England. The article states that the number has increased over a longer period of time, while the summary states that the number has doubled in the last year, which is not supported by the article.
