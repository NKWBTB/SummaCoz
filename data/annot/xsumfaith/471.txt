Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "first" - The article does not mention that Sarah Storey was the first British woman to win a gold medal at the World Para-athletics Championships. In fact, the article states that she won the gold medal in Nottwil, Switzerland, which is not the same location as the World Para-athletics Championships. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "dame sarah" - The article does not use the title "Dame" before Sarah Storey's name. The article simply refers to her as "Sarah Storey." Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. "para-athletics championships" - The article does not mention the "World Para-athletics Championships." Instead, it states that Sarah Storey won the gold medal in the road race at the Para-cycling World Championships in Nottwil, Switzerland. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, including the location of the event, the title used to refer to Sarah Storey, and the name of the championship.
