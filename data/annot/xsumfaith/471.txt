    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Dame Sarah Storey became the first British woman to win a gold medal at the World Para-Athletics Championships in London. However, the article does not mention anything about the World Para-Athletics Championships being held in London. Instead, it states that the event was held in Nottwil, Switzerland. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary also states that Dame Sarah Storey won a gold medal, but the article does not confirm this. Instead, it states that she finished more than two minutes ahead of Poland's Anna Harkowska and won a 17th title in the road race.
3. The summary mentions that Dame Sarah Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the article does not mention anything about Rio de Janeiro or the Paralympics.
4. The summary states that Dame Sarah Storey is Britain's most decorated female Paralympian with 22 medals, but the article only mentions that she has won 21 world titles across both sports.
5. Finally, the summary mentions that Dame Sarah Storey began her sporting career in the pool, but the article states that she switched to cycling in 2005.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
