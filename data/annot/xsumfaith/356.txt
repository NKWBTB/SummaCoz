Opener Stuart Thompson hit 56 while Gary Wilson (41 no) and captain William Porterfield (39) added valuable runs as Ireland made 165-5 in Greater Noida.
It was not enough with Samiullah Shenwari (56) and Mohammad Shahzad (47) helping the Afghans to 171-4 with two overs to spare.
The sides meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday.
Ireland suffered an early blow when opener Paul Stirling was dismissed for a duck and with just one run on the board.
Thompson and Porterfield steadied the innings before Wilson helped the Irish to a competitive total.
Shahzad and Najeeb Tarakai (27) put on an opening stand of 51 as Afghanistan cruised to their victory target.
Afghan spinner Amir Hamza (2-23) was the only bowler to take more than one wicket on a day when the bat dominated.
"We fell a little bit short of potentially a very big score. We could have added another 15 and gotten up to the 180 we were looking for," said Porterfield.
"As well as we played I thought we just came up short with the ball. We didn't quite execute things as well as we would have liked."
The loss of paceman Boyd Rankin for the T20s, because of a back problem, was another setback for the Irish on Wednesday.
Rankin is expected to return for the five ODIs against Afghanistan, starting on 15 March.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "ireland reached the semi-finals of the intercontinental cup with a six-wicket victory over afghanistan in the intercontinental cup in dubai"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the match was played in Greater Noida, India, but the summary claims that the match was played in Dubai. This is a clear inconsistency.
2. The article mentions that Ireland made 165-5, but the summary states that Ireland reached the semi-finals of the intercontinental cup with a six-wicket victory. This is not supported by the article, as Ireland did not win the match by six wickets.
3. The article mentions that Afghanistan made 171-4, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it claims that Ireland won the match with a six-wicket victory.
4. The article quotes captain William Porterfield as saying that Ireland fell short of a potentially big score and that they could have added another 15 runs to reach 180. This is not mentioned in the summary.
5. The article also mentions that Boyd Rankin is expected to return for the five ODIs against Afghanistan starting on 15 March, but this is not mentioned in the summary.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article. It contains several inconsistencies and omits important details.
