</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the casualty was airlifted off Slieve Gullion, but the summary only mentions that the casualty was injured on a mountain in County Armagh. This is not consistent, as Slieve Gullion is located in County Down, not Armagh.
2. The article specifically states that the casualty had a "serious leg injury," but this information is not present in the summary.
3. The article mentions that multiple agencies were involved in the rescue, including the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team, Belfast Coastguard, Irish Coastguard, PSNI, and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service. This information is not present in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the details of the casualty's location, injuries, and the involvement of multiple agencies in the rescue.
