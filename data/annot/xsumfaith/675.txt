For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "county armagh",
  "paraglider"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "County Armagh" is not consistent with the article because the article states that the rescue took place on Slieve Gullion, which is located in the Mourne Mountains, not in County Armagh. County Armagh is a separate location in Northern Ireland.
2. "Paraglider" is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about a paraglider. The article only mentions a person with a "serious leg injury" who was airlifted off Slieve Gullion.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two inaccuracies: the location and the type of activity involved.
