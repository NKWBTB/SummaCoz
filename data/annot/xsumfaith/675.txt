    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the paraglider was rescued after being injured on a mountain in County Armagh. However, the article states that the casualty was airlifted off Slieve Gullion, which is located in County Down, not County Armagh.
2. The summary does not mention the fact that the casualty had a "serious leg injury" as stated in the article. This information is crucial to understanding the severity of the situation and the need for a rescue.
3. The summary mentions that the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team was training in the Annalong Valley when the emergency call came, but the article does not mention this detail.
4. The summary states that the rescue involved Mourne Mountain Rescue Team, Belfast Coastguard, Irish coastguard, PSNI, and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, but does not mention the specific roles of each group. The article provides more detail on the involvement of each group.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it leaves out important details and includes some inaccuracies.
