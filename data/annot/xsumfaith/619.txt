    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man who coerced a woman into having sex with a stranger before sending ``revenge porn\'\'to her family has been jailed for six years. 

    Article: 
    Clive Weatherhogg set up meetings between the woman and a man he found through an adult website, and filmed them having sex.
A court heard he sent a message containing a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day.
Weatherhogg, 42, was also placed on the sex offenders register.
He had denied the charges but was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff George Way remitted the case to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because its greater sentencing powers.
Weatherhogg, formerly of Guthrie, near Forfar, was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with the man between 10 September, 2013 and 17 September the following year.
He was also convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on 25 December, 2014.
The woman told the trial she had felt "blackmailed" by Weatherhogg.
Lady Wolffe told the Weatherhogg that she had to pass a sentence on him that "reflected society's abhorrence" at such conduct.
The judge said that Weatherhogg, a first offender, had been assessed as posing "a moderate risk" of sexual re-offending.
Defence counsel Jonathan Crowe said it had been "a dramatic shock" for Weatherhogg to be placed on remand ahead of sentencing. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was jailed for six years for coercing a woman into having sex with a stranger, and sending a sexually explicit clip to her family.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the man coercing the woman into having sex with a stranger. Instead, it states that Weatherhogg set up meetings between the woman and a man he found through an adult website, and filmed them having sex.
3. The article also does not mention anything about sending a sexually explicit clip to the victim's family. The only mention of sending a message is in the context of Weatherhogg sending a message containing a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
5. Specifically, the summary falsely implies that the man coerced the woman into having sex with a stranger, and that he sent a sexually explicit clip to her family. In reality, the article states that Weatherhogg set up meetings between the woman and a man he found through an adult website, and filmed them having sex, but does not mention coercion or sending explicit clips to the family.
