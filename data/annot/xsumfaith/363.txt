    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man from stranraer has been conned out of the internet by a stranger who stole more than # 1m. 

    Article: 
    The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT.
Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet.
He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash.
The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later.
PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.
"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.
"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.
"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a man from Stranraer was conned out of more than #1m, but the article does not mention any male victims. The article only mentions a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills and a woman in Stranraer, both of whom were targeted by scammers claiming to be from BT technical support.
2. The summary states that the scammer gained remote access to the victim's computer to take the cash, but the article does not mention any specific details about the scammer gaining remote access to the victim's computer. The article only mentions that the scammer claimed to be from BT technical support and tricked the victim into giving out banking details.
3. The summary states that the incident in Stranraer happened seven days after the incident in Sandyhills, but the article does not provide any information about the timing of the incidents.
4. The summary does not mention PC Siobhan Pellett's warning about never giving out banking details or account numbers over the telephone, but the article does include this information.

Therefore, based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
