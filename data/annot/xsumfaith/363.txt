<Article>
The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT.
Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet.
He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash.
The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later.
PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.
"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.
"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.
"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information."

<Summary>
a man from stranraer has been conned out of the internet by a stranger who stole more than # 1m.
</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "more than # 1m",
  "man"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "more than # 1m": The article states that the victim lost "substantial" amounts of money, but it doesn't specify the exact amount. The summary, on the other hand, states that the victim was conned out of "more than # 1m". This is inconsistent with the article, as it implies that the victim lost a specific amount (# 1m) when the article only states that the amount was "substantial".
2. "man": The article states that the victim was a woman from Stranraer, while the summary states that the victim was a man from Stranraer. This is inconsistent with the article, as it incorrectly gendered the victim.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues with the article.
