<Article>
The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT.
Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet.
He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash.
The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later.
PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.
"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.
"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.
"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a man from Stranraer was conned out of the internet by a stranger who stole more than £1 million.
2. The article does not mention any incident where a man from Stranraer was conned out of the internet. Instead, it reports two incidents where elderly women were targeted by scammers claiming to be from BT technical support.
3. The article states that the scammers gained remote access to the victims' computers and stole substantial amounts of money. However, there is no mention of any incident where a man from Stranraer lost more than £1 million.
4. The article emphasizes the importance of being cautious when answering cold calls from people claiming to be from technical support, and never giving out banking details or account numbers over the phone.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it describes an incident that does not exist in the article. The article only reports two incidents involving elderly women being targeted by scammers, and does not mention any incident involving a man from Stranraer losing more than £1 million.
