Police Scotland have appealed to anyone who may have seen the elderly woman, or the bin lorry, before the incident occurred.
Sgt Andrew Miller, of the road policing unit, said: "The woman was walking with a wheeled walking aid, similar to a zimmer frame, and we're hopeful anyone who might have seen her will come forward with relevant information."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "85-year-old",
  "an 85-year-old woman has died after being struck by a bin lorry in edinburgh",
  "edinburgh",
  "died"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "85-year-old": The article does not mention the woman's age. The word "85-year-old" is not supported by the article.
2. "an 85-year-old woman has died": The article does not use the phrase "an 85-year-old woman." The correct phrase would be "the elderly woman."
3. "edinburgh": The article does not mention the city of Edinburgh. The correct location is "Morningside Road, near to Jordan Lane."
4. "died": The article does not use the word "died." The correct word would be "injured."

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article. The correct summary should be:

"An elderly woman was injured after being struck by a bin lorry on Morningside Road, near to Jordan Lane, in Edinburgh."
