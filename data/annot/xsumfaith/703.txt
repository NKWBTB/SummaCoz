</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that an 85-year-old woman has died after being struck by a bin lorry in Edinburgh.
2. However, the article does not mention the woman's death. Instead, it reports that the woman was injured and that police are appealing for witnesses.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the woman has died, while the article does not confirm this.
4. The reason for the inconsistency is that the summary is not supported by the information in the article. The article does not mention the woman's death, only her injury.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and should not be relied upon as a summary of the article.
