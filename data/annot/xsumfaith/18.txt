    Summary: 
    author jk rowling has said she has been blocked from posting abusive messages on twitter. 

    Article: 
    Their comments, she wrote, "reminds me how big the world is and how many more decent people there are than not".
The Harry Potter author previously tweeted that her "personal line [had] been crossed" by some abusive comments.
"It isn't always fun being a famous woman on Twitter and I believe in standing up to bullies," she wrote.
Rowling faced a flood of criticism on Twitter last year after it emerged she had donated Â£1m to the campaign for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum.
In 2008, she donated the same amount to the Labour party.
On Friday the author revealed she had been called "a traitor" for her political views and had blocked some abusive Twitter users she believed had been supporters of the Scottish National Party (SNP).
"I feel no responsibility to hush up that kind of behaviour to protect the image of any political party," she told one Twitter user.
The 49-year-old also revealed she had "responded to other really nice SNP supporters" and had discussed "how much I had in common politically with many of them".
The writer also joked she would "bring marshmallows" after a Twitter user suggested her books should be burned in public.
The SNP took 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland in Thursday's election and is now the third largest party in the UK. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that JK Rowling has been blocked from posting abusive messages on Twitter, but the article does not mention anything about her being blocked.
2. The summary mentions that Rowling has been called a traitor for her political views, but the article only mentions that she faced a flood of criticism on Twitter after donating to the Labour party in 2008 and supporting the No vote in the Scottish independence referendum.
3. The summary states that Rowling has blocked some abusive Twitter users, but the article only mentions that she responded to some SNP supporters and joked about bringing marshmallows.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the extent of the abuse Rowling has faced and implies that she has been blocked from Twitter, which is not supported by the article.
