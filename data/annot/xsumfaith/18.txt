Their comments, she wrote, "reminds me how big the world is and how many more decent people there are than not".
The Harry Potter author previously tweeted that her "personal line [had] been crossed" by some abusive comments.
"It isn't always fun being a famous woman on Twitter and I believe in standing up to bullies," she wrote.
Rowling faced a flood of criticism on Twitter last year after it emerged she had donated Â£1m to the campaign for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum.
In 2008, she donated the same amount to the Labour party.
On Friday the author revealed she had been called "a traitor" for her political views and had blocked some abusive Twitter users she believed had been supporters of the Scottish National Party (SNP).
"I feel no responsibility to hush up that kind of behaviour to protect the image of any political party," she told one Twitter user.
The 49-year-old also revealed she had "responded to other really nice SNP supporters" and had discussed "how much I had in common politically with many of them".
The writer also joked she would "bring marshmallows" after a Twitter user suggested her books should be burned in public.
The SNP took 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland in Thursday's election and is now the third largest party in the UK.

<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that JK Rowling has been blocked from posting abusive messages on Twitter.
2. However, the article states that Rowling has blocked some abusive Twitter users she believed had been supporters of the Scottish National Party (SNP) after being called "a traitor" for her political views.
3. The article does not mention anything about Rowling being blocked from posting abusive messages. Instead, it states that she has blocked some users who had been abusive towards her.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Rowling has been blocked from posting abusive messages, while the article states that she has blocked some users who had been abusive towards her.
5. The discrepancy between the summary and the article is likely due to a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the information in the article. The article does not mention anything about Rowling being blocked from posting abusive messages, and the summary should have been more accurate in its representation of the information.
