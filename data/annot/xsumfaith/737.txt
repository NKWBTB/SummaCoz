<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
The local authority said Richard Ellis was leaving on Friday at the end of his contract.
Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are both going under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.
Stephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, said the departures were indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff.
He said he expected further departures in the coming months.
Mr Ellis is the council's former interim director of corporate governance, and has also been acting as deputy chief executive for several months.
Mr Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, while Mr Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.
Council chief executive Angela Scott thanked the trio for their "dedication and professionalism".

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "three senior officials are to leave their roles at Aberdeen City Council."
2. The article states that Richard Ellis, Ciaran Monaghan, and Ewan Sutherland are leaving their roles at Aberdeen City Council.
3. However, the summary does not mention the names of the individuals who are leaving, only stating that "three senior officials" are leaving.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail about the individuals who are leaving. The article provides the names of the individuals and their positions within the council, while the summary only provides a generic statement about "three senior officials" leaving.
