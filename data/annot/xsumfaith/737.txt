<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
The local authority said Richard Ellis was leaving on Friday at the end of his contract.
Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are both going under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.
Stephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, said the departures were indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff.
He said he expected further departures in the coming months.
Mr Ellis is the council's former interim director of corporate governance, and has also been acting as deputy chief executive for several months.
Mr Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, while Mr Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.
Council chief executive Angela Scott thanked the trio for their "dedication and professionalism".

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

  "aberdeen city"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Richard Ellis is leaving the council at the end of his contract on Friday. This information is not included in the summary.
2. The summary mentions "three senior officials" leaving their roles, but the article only mentions two individuals (Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland) who are leaving under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme. The third person mentioned in the summary (Stephen Flynn) is not a senior official and is not leaving the council.
3. The summary mentions "aberdeen city council", but the article does not provide any information about the location of the council.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Omits information about Richard Ellis's departure
* Includes incorrect information about the number of senior officials leaving
* Mentions a location (Aberdeen) that is not provided in the article.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
