Mr Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, while Mr Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.
Council chief executive Angela Scott thanked the trio for their "dedication and professionalism". 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that three senior officials are leaving their roles at Aberdeen City Council.
2. However, the article states that only one official, Richard Ellis, is leaving at the end of his contract. Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are leaving under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the reasons for the departures of the three officials.
4. The article provides more information about the departures, such as the fact that Mr. Ellis was the council's former interim director of corporate governance and had been acting as deputy chief executive for several months, and that Mr. Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office and Mr. Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.
5. The article also includes a quote from the council chief executive, Angela Scott, thanking the trio for their "dedication and professionalism".
6. The summary does not include any of this additional information, which makes it inconsistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not a consistent summary of the article because it does not accurately reflect the reasons for the departures of the three officials and leaves out important details about their roles and the council's appreciation for their service.
