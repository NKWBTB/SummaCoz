Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Ian Durrant spent 14 years as a player at Rangers, but the summary incorrectly spells his name as "ian." This is a consistency issue because the article uses the correct spelling of "Ian."
2. The article states that Ian Durrant has been a coach at Rangers for 14 years, but the summary incorrectly states that he is leaving the club as part of a coaching reshuffle. This is a consistency issue because the article does not mention any reshuffle or departure from the club.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two spelling errors and one incorrect statement about Ian Durrant's departure from the club.
