Rangers manager Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel, leaving Durrant without a position at Ibrox.
He spent 14 years as a player at Rangers, before returning as a coach in 2005.
Durrant held several positions in the youth set-up, then stepped up to work with the first team during Walter Smith's second spell as manager in 2007.
He was first-team coach when Ally McCoist succeeded Smith in 2011, then returned to working with the youths again after McCoist resigned during season 2014-15. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ian Durrant is to end his long association with Rangers as part of a coaching reshuffle.
2. However, the article states that Durrant will not return for the start of pre-season training, implying that he will no longer be part of the coaching staff.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Durrant not returning for pre-season training, which suggests that it is not consistent with the article.
4. The article states that Rangers manager Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel, which suggests that Durrant's departure is part of a larger shake-up.
5. The summary does not mention any reasons for Durrant's departure, which is not consistent with the article.
6. The article mentions that Durrant has spent 14 years as a player at Rangers and has been a coach at the club for over 10 years, which suggests that he has had a long and distinguished career at the club.
7. However, the summary does not mention any of this background information, which is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information or context as the article. Specifically, it does not mention Durrant's departure from the club, the reasons for his departure, or his long history with the club.
