Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna beat Vytautas Kirkliauskas of Lithuania, carrying his wife, Neringa Kirliauskiene.
Rich said: "We put in a whole week's work, running around the athletics track near where we live - and it's paid off"
"We were pushed hard, especially by the Lithuanians there."
Competitors must tackle a 380-metre course, hurdling over haystacks, scrabbling up a steep slope, and dodging water pistols.
You don't need to be married to take part.
The race saw all combinations of competitors - men carrying women, men carrying men and one woman carrying a woman.
Rich and Anna will now compete at the World Championships in Finland in July. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a pair of paralympian pistols set up a marathon on track to break the world championships in Lithuania. However, the article does not mention anything about pistols or a marathon.
2. The article does mention a couple, Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna, who beat a Lithuanian couple, Vytautas Kirkliauskas and his wife Neringa Kirliauskiene, in a race.
3. The race was held on an athletics track and involved hurdling over haystacks, scrabbling up a steep slope, and dodging water pistols.
4. The article states that all combinations of competitors were allowed, including men carrying women, men carrying men, and one woman carrying a woman.
5. The article does not mention anything about breaking the world championships or being held in Lithuania.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions things that are not present in the article, such as pistols and a marathon, and omits other important details, such as the location of the race and the fact that all combinations of competitors were allowed.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a pair of paralympian pistols set up a marathon on track to break the world championships in Lithuania. However, the article does not mention anything about pistols or a marathon.
