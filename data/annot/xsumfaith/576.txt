<Article>
St Botolph's Church, known as Boston Stump, was badly damaged following a tidal surge in 2013 that hit the Lincolnshire town of Boston.
The floodlights were replaced but the switch-on was put in doubt when two lights were stolen.
Reverend Alyson Buxton said it was "fantastic" to see the church lit up.
"We've all been so excited for this moment," she said.
"It's wonderful to see so many people here who've had a wonderful service inside. There's at least 400 people here so it's absolutely fantastic."
The lights were switched on by BBC Radio Lincolnshire presenters Carla George and Scott Dalton.
Peter Sherlock, who gave the church Â£2,000 to reinstall the stolen lights, was among those present and said the service was "very moving".
He is still offering a reward of Â£2,000 for information about who stole the lights.
Matt Warman, the Boston and Skegness MP, was also there.
"A lot of Boston's heritage is about this building and it's hugely significant for everyone," he said.
"It's been a long time since the floods that turned these lights off and I think people are now finally starting to see that we are able to get past that and to show people that Boston is unquenchable."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "first time in two years",
  "the exterior of a church known for its tall tower has been lit up for the first time in two years after it was flooded",
  "exterior of a church known for its tall tower",
  "\\nthe exterior of a church known for its tall tower has been lit up for the first time in two years after it was flooded"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "first time in two years": The article does not mention the duration since the flooding, so this phrase is not consistent with the article. The article only mentions that the floodlights were replaced after being stolen, but it does not provide any information about the duration since the flooding.
2. "the exterior of a church known for its tall tower has been lit up for the first time in two years after it was flooded": This phrase is not consistent with the article because the church was already lit up for the first time since the flooding when the switch-on ceremony took place. The article states that the floodlights were replaced and switched on, but it does not mention that it was the first time the church was lit up in two years.
3. "exterior of a church known for its tall tower": The article does not mention the exterior of the church being lit up, only the floodlights being replaced and switched on. The phrase "exterior of a church known for its tall tower" is not consistent with the article.
4. "\\nthe exterior of a church known for its tall tower has been lit up for the first time in two years after it was flooded": This phrase is not consistent with the article because, as mentioned earlier, the church was already lit up for the first time since the flooding when the switch-on ceremony took place.

In conclusion, the summary has several consistency issues with the article, specifically with the phrases "first time in two years", "exterior of a church known for its tall tower", and "\\nthe exterior of a church known for its tall tower has been lit up for the first time in two years after it was flooded". These phrases are not supported by the information in the article, and therefore the summary is not consistent with the article.
