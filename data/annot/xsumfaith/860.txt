APP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze.
What is behind the South East Asia haze?
In a joint statement, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have "not procured or used wood, paper and/or pulp materials" from firms accused of contributing to the fires.
The SEC said retailers were "a good starting point" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and "for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices"
The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region. It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month, in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Anger has been rising in the region, with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that FairPrice is removing the haze caused by fires in Indonesia.
2. However, the article states that FairPrice is removing products from one Indonesian firm, Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the notification from the government.
3. The article does not mention anything about FairPrice removing the haze caused by the fires in Indonesia.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that FairPrice is removing the haze, which is not true.
5. The article only mentions that FairPrice is removing products from one Indonesian firm, APP, due to the government's notification.
6. The summary is an overstatement and misleading because it implies that FairPrice is taking action to remove the haze, when in fact, they are only removing products from one firm.
7. The article provides more specific and accurate information about FairPrice's actions, whereas the summary is a general statement that is not supported by the article.
