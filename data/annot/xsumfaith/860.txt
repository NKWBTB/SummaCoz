    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    supermarket giant fairprice has said it is removing the haze of the haze caused by fires in indonesia and indonesia. 

    Article: 
    Seven firms, including major supermarkets such as NTUC FairPrice and IKEA, have been asked declare they are not doing so within a week.
The forest fires in Indonesia have deteriorated Singapore's air quality, causing a blanket of haze in the city.
FairPrice has said it removing products from one Indonesian firm.
The state-owned supermarket giant said that it was removing all paper products sourced from Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the notification from the government.
APP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze.
What is behind the South East Asia haze?
In a joint statement, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have "not procured or used wood, paper and/or pulp materials" from firms accused of contributing to the fires.
The SEC said retailers were "a good starting point" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and "for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices"
The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region. It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month, in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Anger has been rising in the region, with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that FairPrice is removing the haze caused by fires in Indonesia and Indonesia. However, the article states that FairPrice is only removing products from one Indonesian firm, Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the notification from the government.
2. The summary implies that FairPrice is taking action to remove the haze, but the article states that FairPrice is only removing products from one firm, which is not the same as removing the haze.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the reason for FairPrice's action, which is the government's notification, as stated in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the word "haze" once, while the article mentions it several times, indicating that the summary is not consistent with the article in terms of the main issue being discussed.
5. The article is focused on the retailers' response to the haze, while the summary is focused on FairPrice's action, which is not consistent with the article's focus.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a misleading summary of the article's content.
