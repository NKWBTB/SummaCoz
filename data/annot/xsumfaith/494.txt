The 23-year-old from Kinross finished second behind Kenyan Faith Kipyegon in four minutes, 19.12 seconds.
That erased Yvonne Murray's 1994 effort of 4:22.60 in the Scottish rankings and moved her second on the British all-time list behind Zola Budd's 4:17.57.
The new record holder said: "I am really pleased to get that Scottish record. It means a lot to me."
Muir, who finished fifth in last year's World Championships, now holds the Scottish 1500m and mile records.
"This is my first race of the season over this distance, so I am really pleased," she said.
"Faith's been running so quick, so to get so close to her, I'm excited.
Murray's husband, Tom Mooney, said on Facebook: "Yvonne says: 'Well done to you, Laura."
Muir hopes to secure an Olympics place for Great Britain in Rio at the British trials in Birmingham from 24 to 26 June.
The Scot started her season with an 800m victory in Montbeliard, France, last week and next competes in a week's time in a 1500m race in Stockholm.
"Training's been going really, so I was expecting to run a good race," added Muir, who fits her training around her veterinary studies. She recently completed her fourth year of vet school.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "first british woman to win a world record for the fastest time in her career"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Laura Muir finished second behind Kenyan Faith Kipyegon with a time of 4:19.12, which is a Scottish record but not a world record.
2. The summary claims that Laura Muir has become the "first British woman to win a world record for the fastest time in her career." This statement is not supported by the article, as the article does not mention any world record being set by Muir.
3. The phrase "first British woman to win a world record" is not consistent with the article's content, as the article does not mention any world record being set by Muir.
4. The phrase "fastest time in her career" is also not consistent with the article's content, as the article does not mention Muir's time being a personal best or a record for her career.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues and is not accurately representing the content of the article.
