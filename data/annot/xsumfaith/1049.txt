     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Wrexham signed Jackson from Barnsley for an undisclosed fee on a two-year deal. However, the article states that Jackson turned down a contract offer from Wrexham for next season. This implies that Wrexham did not sign Jackson from Barnsley.
2. The summary mentions that Jackson is a midfielder, but the article does not mention his position.
3. The summary states that Jackson scored four goals in 36 appearances last season, but the article does not provide any information about his performance statistics.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions.
