</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "a nine-year-old boy is being treated in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in north lanarkshire on saturday",
  "nine-year-old",
  "vehicle in north lanarkshire on saturday",
  "hit by a vehicle in north lanarkshire on saturday"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the boy was struck in Coatbridge, but the summary says he was hit by a vehicle in north Lanarkshire on Saturday. The article does not mention the location of the incident as north Lanarkshire, so this is inconsistent.
2. The article does not mention the age of the boy, but the summary states that he is nine years old. This is not supported by the article.
3. The article states that the boy was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, but the summary does not mention the location of the hospital. This is inconsistent.
4. The article does not mention the day of the week or the time of the incident, but the summary states that it happened on Saturday. This is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
