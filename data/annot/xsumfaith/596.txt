    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the boy was hit by a vehicle in north Lanarkshire on Saturday.
2. The article states that the incident occurred in Coatbridge, which is in Lanarkshire, but it does not specify the exact location of the incident.
3. The summary states that the boy was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which is not located in north Lanarkshire.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because the location of the incident and the hospital where the boy was taken are not accurately described.

Overall, the summary contains incorrect information about the location of the incident and the hospital where the boy was taken, which is not supported by the article.
