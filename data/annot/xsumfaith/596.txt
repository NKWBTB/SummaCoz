<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the boy was struck in Coatbridge, but the summary only mentions "north Lanarkshire." This is inconsistent, as Coatbridge is a specific location within Lanarkshire, but the summary does not specify the exact location.
2. The article states that the boy was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which is not in north Lanarkshire. The summary does not mention the hospital or the location of the boy's treatment.
3. The article describes the boy's condition as "serious," but the summary does not provide any information about his condition.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and specificity as the article. The summary does not mention the exact location of the incident, the boy's condition, or the hospital where he was taken for treatment.
