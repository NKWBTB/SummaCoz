    Summary: 
    the chief executive of a highland council has resigned. 

    Article: 
    The local authority said Richard Ellis was leaving on Friday at the end of his contract.
Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are both going under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.
Stephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, said the departures were indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff.
He said he expected further departures in the coming months.
Mr Ellis is the council's former interim director of corporate governance, and has also been acting as deputy chief executive for several months.
Mr Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, while Mr Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.
Council chief executive Angela Scott thanked the trio for their "dedication and professionalism". 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the chief executive of a highland council has resigned.

However, the article does not mention the chief executive resigning. Instead, it states that three senior staff members, including Mr. Ellis, are leaving the council under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.

2. The summary does not mention the reasons for the departures, but the article states that the departures are indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff.

3. The summary does not mention the names of the other two staff members leaving, but the article mentions that Ciaran Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, and Ewan Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.

4. The summary does not mention the council's leader, Stephen Flynn, or his comments about further departures in the coming months.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the reasons for the departures, the names of the staff members leaving, or the leader's comments about further departures.

###Corrected:
