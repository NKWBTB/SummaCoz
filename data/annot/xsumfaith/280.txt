    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the family of a woman who has been missing for more than a year are appealing for help to trace her. 

    Article: 
    Margaret Fleming, 36, was last seen at her home in Inverkip by her two carers at about 17:40 on Friday 28 October.
She is described as about 5ft 5in tall, with collar-length black hair, brown eyes and has a heavy build, although her weight can fluctuate.
Police had said they were trying to build a picture of Ms Fleming's life, part of which she kept "quite private".
When last seen, she was wearing a green tartan fleece or jumper, dark jeans or trousers, and dark Karrimor-type boots. She also had a satchel-type handbag.
A police spokesman said: "There is a specialist search team combing the area around where the missing person was last seen, this includes in the garden of her last known address."
Speaking earlier this month, Ch Insp Elliot Brown, area commander for Greenock, said: "We are currently working with limited information and whilst it does seem like this is quite an unusual missing person case, it is challenging.
"As we continue to try to piece together Margaret's life, we understand she kept a side of her life quite private so we're trying to look into this in a bit more detail to see if this will help with our inquiries.
"We are working backwards to try to find out more about Margaret, so we've been speaking to friends and family members to establish a clearer picture of her life over the years."
The detective said that Ms Fleming was a student at James Watt College in Greenock between 1996 and 1997.
He said he was keen to speak to anyone who remembered her from then, and who might have been in touch with her over the years. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the family of Margaret Fleming is appealing for help to trace her, but the article does not mention anything about the family appealing for help. The article only mentions the police searching for Margaret and asking for information about her.
2. The summary mentions that Margaret has been missing for more than a year, but the article only states that she was last seen on Friday, October 28th.
3. The summary describes Margaret as being 5ft 5in tall with collar-length black hair, brown eyes, and a heavy build, but the article does not provide any physical description of her.
4. The summary states that Margaret was wearing a green tartan fleece or jumper, dark jeans or trousers, and dark Karrimor-type boots when she was last seen, but the article does not mention any specific clothing items.
5. The summary mentions that the police are searching the area around Margaret's last known address, but the article only states that a specialist search team is combing the area where she was last seen.
6. The summary quotes a police spokesman as saying that they are working with limited information and that Margaret kept a side of her life quite private, but the article does not include any quotes from the police.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
