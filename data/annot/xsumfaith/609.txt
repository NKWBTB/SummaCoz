    Summary: 
    road racer guy martin says he will not compete for honda for the rest of 2017 after a frustrating season. 

    Article: 
    The English rider crashed at this year's TT and the Fireblade bike has been plagued by mechanical problems.
Martin told MCN that he was quitting road racing but he later clarifying his position on Facebook.
"I've not given up on racing or road racing but I've got no plans to do anymore road racing on the Hondas this year," he said.
Martin didn't race at the North West 200 after team-mate John McGuinness crashed in practice and he will not compete in next month's Ulster Grand Prix.
He added: "The TT was a bloody disaster, aside from walking the dog and racing the Mugen, I didn't enjoy it.
"It was clear even before that we were going to struggle and then it turned into me really being a test rider, which I did.
"But after we did more testing at Cadwell a few weeks back, I said to the team the bike won't be competitive at the Ulster Grand Prix and they decided to withdraw me from the event, although they didn't tell me, which is OK as the decision was made for me.
"There's no unfinished business and I want to race classics and oddball stuff." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Guy Martin will not compete for Honda for the rest of 2017, but the article does not mention anything about Guy Martin not competing for Honda for the rest of the year.
2. The article states that Guy Martin crashed at the TT and the Fireblade bike has been plagued by mechanical problems, which may have contributed to his decision not to compete in certain events.
3. The article also states that Guy Martin did not race at the North West 200 after teammate John McGuinness crashed in practice, and he will not compete in next month's Ulster Grand Prix.
4. However, the article does not mention anything about Guy Martin quitting road racing altogether, as the summary states.
5. In fact, the article quotes Guy Martin as saying "There's no unfinished business and I want to race classics and oddball stuff," which suggests that he still intends to compete in road racing, just not on the Honda bike for the rest of the year.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Guy Martin will not compete for Honda for the rest of the year, while the article only mentions that he will not compete in certain events and still intends to race in the future.
