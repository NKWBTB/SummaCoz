<Article>
The English rider crashed at this year's TT and the Fireblade bike has been plagued by mechanical problems.
Martin told MCN that he was quitting road racing but he later clarifying his position on Facebook.
"I've not given up on racing or road racing but I've got no plans to do anymore road racing on the Hondas this year," he said.
Martin didn't race at the North West 200 after team-mate John McGuinness crashed in practice and he will not compete in next month's Ulster Grand Prix.
He added: "The TT was a bloody disaster, aside from walking the dog and racing the Mugen, I didn't enjoy it.
"It was clear even before that we were going to struggle and then it turned into me really being a test rider, which I did.
"But after we did more testing at Cadwell a few weeks back, I said to the team the bike won't be competitive at the Ulster Grand Prix and they decided to withdraw me from the event, although they didn't tell me, which is OK as the decision was made for me.
"There's no unfinished business and I want to race classics and oddball stuff."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Guy Martin will not compete for Honda for the rest of 2017.
2. However, the article states that Martin has not given up on racing or road racing, and he will continue to race classics and oddball events.
3. The article also mentions that Martin will not compete in the Ulster Grand Prix, but it does not mention anything about not competing for the rest of the year.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Martin will not compete for Honda for the entire year, while the article states that he will continue to race but not on Honda.
5. The summary is also not accurate because it does not mention Martin's plans to race classics and oddball events, which is mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and is not an accurate representation of Martin's statements.
