     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Guiseley "continued their 100% start to the national league season with a victory at Guiseley." However, the article states that the match ended in a draw, not a victory for Guiseley.
2. The summary mentions that Guiseley "went ahead on 15 minutes," but the article states that Guiseley scored their first goal on 15 minutes, not that they went ahead.
3. The summary states that Gateshead "levelled on 62 minutes," but the article states that Gateshead scored their equalizing goal "just before the break."
4. The summary mentions that Guiseley's goal was scored by Jake Lawlor, but the article states that the goal was scored by Wes York.
5. The summary states that the match ended with a score of Gateshead 1, Guiseley 1, but the article states that the match ended with a score of Gateshead 1, Guiseley 1.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. For example, it does not mention the equalizing goal scored by Gateshead, and it does not accurately describe the score at the end of the match.
