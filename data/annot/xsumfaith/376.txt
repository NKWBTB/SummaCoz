Now the complete ban is being lifted.  Until now, any man who had ever had sex with another man was barred for life from donation.
From 7 November the ban is being lifted in England, Scotland and Wales.   But men who want to donate must not have had sex with another man in the past 12 months.
This deferral period has been left in place because there is a "window period" after infection with blood-borne viruses where they are not detectable.
This window period is far less than 12 months.
The report from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) says that for HIV it varies from nine to 15 days, depending on the type of test.  For hepatitis B, which causes liver disease, it is 66 days.
In Spain, the deferral period is six months following the change of a sexual partner, whether the would-be donor is heterosexual or gay.  In Italy the restriction lasts for four months following the change of partner.
By contrast, in the US, Canada, France and many other countries there is a complete ban on donations from men who have ever had sex with men.
Whilst welcoming the lifting of the ban in the UK, some still regard the one year deferral as too long.
Stonewall Chief Executive Ben Summerskill. "To retain a blanket ban on any man who has had sex with another man in the last year, even if he has only had oral sex, remains disproportionate on the basis of available evidence."
But Sir Nick Partridge, Chief Executive of Terrence Higgins Trust said: "The remaining deferral regulation for sexually active gay men is based on their heightened risk, as a group, of sexually acquired blood-borne viruses."
A one year deferral period for donation applies to other groups as well: for example anyone who has been sexually active in countries where HIV/Aids is very common, and anyone who has had sex with a prostitute.
NHS Blood and Transplant has a complete list of who can and cannot donate.
The hope will be that the shift in policy will lead to an increase in the number of donors.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the ban on gay men donating blood in England, Scotland, and Wales has been lifted, but men who have had sex with other men in the past 12 months are deferred for one year.
2. The summary states that the World Health Organization (WHO) has lifted a ban on gay men donating blood in England and Wales.
3. The article does not mention the WHO lifting any ban, and instead states that the ban has been lifted by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) in the UK.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the WHO has lifted the ban, when in fact it is the SaBTO that has lifted the ban in the UK.
5. The WHO has not lifted any ban on gay men donating blood, and the article does not mention the WHO lifting any ban.
6. The summary is incorrect and should be revised to reflect the correct information.

Therefore, the reasoning step by step is:

1. The article and summary have different information.
2. The article states that the ban has been lifted by SaBTO, not WHO.
3. The summary implies that WHO has lifted the ban.
4. WHO has not lifted any ban.
5. The summary is incorrect and should be revised.
