</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article mentions nothing about Loch Lomond being one of the "most excellent" beaches for water quality, nor is it ranked as such.
2. The article only mentions beaches, and Loch Lomond is a loch (a lake) and not a beach.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Loch Lomond has been described as the UK's best place to swim is not supported by the article.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim about Loch Lomond that is not supported by the information in the article.
