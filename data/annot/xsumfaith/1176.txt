It works by looking for a combination of "markers" in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease.
Delegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics.
It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said.
The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and APOE.
But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease.
Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test.
Prof Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients.
But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising.
"Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test.
"As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future."
He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment.
It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained.
Potentially, it could be a "cheap and easy pre-screen" test which enabled Alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said.
"The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk.
"If they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing."
Dr Eric Karran, director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital.
"While there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available, the results are promising.
"When used alongside other diagnostic techniques, a blood test like this could be a real help."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that an international test for Alzheimer's disease has been developed by researchers in Nottingham.
2. However, the article does not mention the word "international" or any specific test being developed by researchers in Nottingham.
3. The article discusses a blood test that uses a combination of markers to diagnose Alzheimer's disease, but the summary does not mention any specific test or markers.
4. The article mentions that the researchers are still validating the test and that it could be a decade before it is used in patients, but the summary does not mention any of this.
5. The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the content or the research discussed in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not a reliable representation of the article and may be misleading to readers.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that an international test for Alzheimer's disease has been developed by researchers in Nottingham.
2. However, the article does not mention the word "international" or any specific test being developed by researchers in Nottingham.
