<Article>
Harry Whitlam died after Gary Green, 51, of Bradburn Road, Wakefield, reversed the vehicle into him at Swithens Farm, Rothwell, near Leeds, in August 2013.
Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit.
The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST.
Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been "changed forever".
"It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle," she said.
"My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared."
"We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder," she added.
"Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin.
"The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more."
Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others.
He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death.
During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August.
HSE inspector Julian Franklin said it was "an extremely tragic case" and described Green's behaviour as "reckless".

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "11-year-old",
  "more than a year",
  "a drunken tractor driver who knocked down and killed an 11-year-old boy has been jailed for more than a year"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "11-year-old": The article states that Harry Whitlam was 11 years old, but the summary only mentions an "11-year-old boy" without specifying his name. This inconsistency may be due to the fact that the summary is brief and does not provide the name of the victim.
2. "more than a year": The article states that Green was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, which is more than a year, but the summary only mentions "more than a year". This inconsistency may be due to rounding or simplification.
3. "a drunken tractor driver who knocked down and killed an 11-year-old boy has been jailed for more than a year": This sentence in the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the details of the case. The article states that Green reversed the tractor into Harry, who was 11 years old, and that he was drunk at the time. The summary sentence implies that Green knocked Harry down with the tractor, which is not what the article states.

Overall, the inconsistencies in the summary may be due to the brevity of the summary and the fact that it does not provide the name of the victim. However, the sentence that is not consistent with the article is the third one mentioned above, as it does not accurately convey the details of the case.
