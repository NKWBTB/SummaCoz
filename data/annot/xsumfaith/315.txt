Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "thousands of people have been left without power in north Wales."
2. The article does not mention any power cuts or outages in north Wales.
3. The article does mention that hundreds of homes across Wales experienced power cuts, but it does not specify any specific region or area, including north Wales.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not supported by the information in the article, and it is an exaggeration or inaccuracy.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions power outages in north Wales, which is not supported by the information in the article.
