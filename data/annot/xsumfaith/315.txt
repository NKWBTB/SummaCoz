    Summary: 
    thousands of people have been left without power in north wales as storm doris sweeps across wales. 

    Article: 
    Part of a school roof was ripped off at Rhosgadfan near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, while hundreds of homes across Wales experienced power cuts.
The day saw train delays, speed and lane restrictions on major bridges and power cuts for hundreds of homes.
It followed a yellow 'be aware' warning for wind across Wales, which was in force until midnight on Friday.
Friday has been one of the busiest days of the festive season on UK roads as the Christmas getaway combined with the end of the working week.
The highest gusts of wind were recorded on Friday afternoon at Mona on Anglesey.
Irish Ferries cancelled six of its fast sailings between Holyhead and Dublin due to "adverse weather conditions" on the Irish Sea, transferring passengers to their cruise ferry services.
Arriva Trains Wales warned of "speed restrictions and possible delays" for all services between Llandudno Junction to Holyhead due to the winds.
The National Trust also closed Erddig Hall and Chirk Castle in Wrexham due to the expected high winds.
Winds eased into Friday evening, with earlier restrictions on both the A55 Britannia Bridge in north Wales and the M48 Severn Bridge in Monmouthshire lifted.
But a blustery forecast for the Christmas weekend has seen at least one festive event postponed - Rhyl's Boxing Day Dip in the sea in Denbighshire will now go ahead 24 hours later, on Tuesday, 27 December.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that thousands of people in North Wales have been left without power, but the article does not mention anything about power outages.
2. The article mentions that hundreds of homes across Wales experienced power cuts, but it does not specify that thousands of people in North Wales were affected.
3. The summary states that the power cuts were caused by Storm Doris, but the article does not mention the storm by name. It only refers to "adverse weather conditions" and "high winds."
4. The summary mentions that the power cuts were widespread, but the article only mentions that hundreds of homes were affected.
5. The summary states that the power cuts were limited to North Wales, but the article does not specify the location of the power cuts. It only mentions that the adverse weather conditions and high winds affected "hundreds of homes" across Wales.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the scope and impact of the power cuts, specifically the location and number of people affected. The article provides more specific and limited information about the power cuts, which are not as widespread or severe as described in the summary.
