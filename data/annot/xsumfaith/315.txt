Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "thousands of people have been left without power in north wales" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention any power outages in north Wales.
2. "as storm doris sweeps across wales" - This statement is inconsistent with the article because the article does not mention any storm named "Doris" affecting Wales.
3. "NaN" - This is not a valid statement and does not appear in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information about power outages and a nonexistent storm.
