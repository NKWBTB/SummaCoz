Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Migaloo, the all-white humpback whale, was spotted off the coast of New South Wales state, including the resort town of Byron Bay.
2. The summary claims that a humpback whale was spotted off the coast of Australia, but does not mention Migaloo or any specific location.
3. The article states that Migaloo was traveling north along Australia's east coast, and was spotted with a companion at one point.
4. The summary does not mention anything about Migaloo traveling with a companion or any specific direction.
5. The article mentions that the White Whale Research Centre provides real-time updates of Migaloo's whereabouts on Twitter.
6. The summary does not mention anything about the White Whale Research Centre or Twitter updates.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is missing many important details that are included in the article, such as Migaloo's distinctive coloring, his journey up the east coast, and the real-time updates provided by the White Whale Research Centre. Additionally, the summary incorrectly states that the whale was spotted off the coast of western isles, which is not mentioned in the article. Therefore, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article's content.
