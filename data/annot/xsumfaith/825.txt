    Summary: 
    a humpback whale spotted off the coast of australia has been captured off the coast of western isles, scientists have said. 

    Article: 
    Migaloo is known for his distinctive colouring and for many years was the only documented all-white humpback whale in the world.
He has been sighted off the coast of New South Wales state, including the resort town of Byron Bay.
Migaloo's journey up Australia's east coast has attracted large numbers of whale enthusiasts.
The 14m-long mammal was spotted with a companion during his venture north but now appears to be travelling solo.
A Twitter account run by the White Whale Research Centre provides real-time updates of the whale's whereabouts. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a humpback whale has been captured off the coast of Western Isles, but the article does not mention anything about capture. Instead, it talks about Migaloo, an all-white humpback whale, being spotted off the coast of New South Wales state.
2. The article does not mention anything about Migaloo being spotted off the coast of Western Isles.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions a location (Western Isles) and an event (capture) that are not present in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains information that is not supported by the article.
