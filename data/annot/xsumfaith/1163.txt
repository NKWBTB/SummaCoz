    Summary: 
    malaysia\'s aviation authority has decided not to broadcast a satellite tracking system for flight mh370, which was revealed in 2015. 

    Article: 
    The decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars.
MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board.
Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations.
This will allow "real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world," said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau.
The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems.
The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered.
Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.
The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it.
The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.
In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane.
Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had "responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking."
The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.
These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Malaysia's aviation authority has decided not to broadcast a satellite tracking system for flight MH370, but the article does not mention anything about Malaysia or its aviation authority.
2. The article discusses the decision taken at a UN conference to set aside a radio frequency for satellite tracking of planes, but the summary does not mention the UN conference or the radio frequency.
3. The article mentions that the deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions from aircraft, but the summary does not mention anything about satellites or satellite tracking.
4. The article states that the decision was taken to improve on the current tracking system, which relies on ground-based radars, but the summary does not mention anything about the current tracking system or the need for improvement.
5. The article mentions that the disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems, but the summary does not mention anything about the disappearance of MH370 or the need for new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content or the main points of the article.
