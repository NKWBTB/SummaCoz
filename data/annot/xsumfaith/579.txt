<Article>
Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died last week at his home in Swansea, the city at the centre of an epidemic of the disease which has reached 942 cases.
But the examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of his death.
An inquest will be opened and adjourned on Tuesday to allow further tests.
Since the outbreak began in November, 83 people have needed hospital treatment for the illness.
Mr Colfer-Williams' mother, Angela Colfer said her son had recently been treated at Swansea's Morriston Hospital for asthma.
A few days after he was discharged he became unwell and developed a rash.
Mrs Colfer said her son went to see an out-of-hours GP on 17 April with a rash "from head to foot" but not on his arms.
The following morning, Mr Colfer-Williams was found dead at his flat.
Public Health Wales said on Friday that laboratory tests confirmed a diagnosis of measles but further tests were needed to determine the cause of death.
The family said they had no idea how Mr Colfer-Williams got measles as no close family member has it, including his three-year-old daughter who has been vaccinated.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "after post-mortem examination results were inconclusive",
  NaN
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the post-mortem examination was unable to establish whether measles was the main cause of the man's death. This means that the examination did not provide conclusive results.
2. The summary states that "further tests will be carried out on a man who died while suffering from measles after post-mortem examination results were inconclusive." This implies that the post-mortem examination did provide conclusive results, which contradicts the article.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it suggests that the post-mortem examination provided conclusive results, while the article states that the examination was unable to establish the cause of death.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
