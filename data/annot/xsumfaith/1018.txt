    Summary: 
    australian prime minister malcolm turnbull has been named as australia\'s new prime minister. 

    Article: 
    Mr Hockey's appointment comes after he left politics following his removal as treasurer by Malcolm Turnbull.
He had been seen as a close ally of Tony Abbott who was ousted as PM by Mr Turnbull in a party vote in September.
Mr Turnbull said Mr Hockey was "a great Australian, he is one of the most engaging, persuasive people I've known in public life".
"He's held very high office, he's got great contacts in the United States, he's a passionate patriot," he told Australian media.
Announcing the appointment, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia's relationship with the United States was the "bedrock of foreign and defence policy".
Some in the Labor opposition questioned the move, citing Mr Turnbull's role in ousting Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey's departure from politics.
"This is a very important posting for Australia and should be done by someone with a deep interest for foreign affairs," said deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek.
"There is no doubt this is a captain's pick by Malcolm Turnbull," she told ABC television.
Kim Beazley, who has has been Australia's ambassador to the United States since 2010, will be replaced by Mr Hockey in January. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Malcolm Turnbull has been named as Australia's new Prime Minister.

However, the article states that Mr. Turnbull is the current Prime Minister of Australia, and there is no mention of him being appointed as the new Prime Minister.

2. The summary states that Mr. Hockey has been appointed as the new Australian Ambassador to the United States.

However, the article states that Mr. Hockey has left politics following his removal as Treasurer by Mr. Turnbull, and there is no mention of him being appointed as the Australian Ambassador to the United States.

3. The summary does not provide any information about the reason for Mr. Hockey's appointment as the Australian Ambassador to the United States.

However, the article states that Mr. Turnbull has appointed Mr. Hockey as the Australian Ambassador to the United States as a "captain's pick," suggesting that the appointment is not based on any specific qualifications or experience in foreign affairs.

4. The summary does not mention the reaction of the Labor opposition to Mr. Hockey's appointment.

However, the article states that the Labor opposition has questioned the move, citing Mr. Turnbull's role in ousting Mr. Abbott and Mr. Hockey's departure from politics.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
