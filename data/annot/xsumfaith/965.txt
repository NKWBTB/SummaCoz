    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the international monetary fund (imf) has said it is ``clearly concerned\'\'about the future of the global economy. 

    Article: 
    David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the IMF is "clearly concerned" about the future of the global economy, but the article does not mention any explicit concern from the IMF. Instead, it quotes David Lipton as saying that the IMF is at a "delicate juncture" and that the global economy is weakening.
2. The summary implies that the IMF has made a statement about the future of the global economy, but the article only mentions that the IMF is likely to downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth in its next release.
3. The summary mentions "the future of the global economy," but the article focuses on the current state of the global economy and the potential downgrade of the IMF's forecast.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies a more explicit statement from the IMF about the future of the global economy, while the article only mentions a potential downgrade of the IMF's forecast and the current weak state of the global economy.
