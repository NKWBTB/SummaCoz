<Article>
David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the IMF is "clearly concerned" about the future of the global economy.
2. The article does not contain any direct quote from the IMF that expresses such a level of concern.
3. The article does mention that the IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows a weakening baseline and that the organization is likely to downgrade its forecast for global growth, but this is not the same as expressing "concern" about the future of the economy.
4. The article does mention that the IMF's comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China, but this does not necessarily imply that the IMF is "concerned" about the future of the global economy.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the level of concern expressed by the IMF. The article presents a more nuanced picture of the IMF's assessment of the global economy, which is weaker than expected but not necessarily "concerning."
