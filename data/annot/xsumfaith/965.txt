<Article>
David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that David Lipton, the IMF's second in command, outlined some risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics.
2. The article quotes Lipton as saying, "The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline." This suggests that the IMF is concerned about the current state of the global economy.
3. The article also states that the IMF is likely to downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April. This further suggests that the IMF is concerned about the future of the global economy.
4. However, the summary states that the IMF is "clearly concerned" about the future of the global economy. This wording is stronger than the language used in the article, which suggests that the IMF is simply concerned about the current state of the economy.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it uses stronger language than the article to describe the IMF's position. The article does not state that the IMF is "clearly concerned" about the future of the global economy. Instead, it states that the IMF is concerned about the current state of the economy and is likely to downgrade its growth forecast.
