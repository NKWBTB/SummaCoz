<Article>
Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Anderson cancelled his contract with Barrow by mutual consent to join Torquay United, a National League rival.
2. The summary states that Torquay United signed Anderson on a two-year contract after he was released by the National League club.
3. The article does not mention anything about Anderson being released by Barrow or signing a two-year contract with Torquay United.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains incorrect information about Anderson's contract and the club he signed with.
