    Summary: 
    national league side torquay united have signed striker myles anderson on a two-year contract after he was released by the national league club. 

    Article: 
    Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Torquay United signed striker Myles Anderson on a two-year contract, but the article states that Anderson is a center-back, not a striker.
2. The summary does not mention anything about Anderson being released by his previous club, Barrow, whereas the article states that he cancelled his contract by mutual consent to join Torquay United.
3. The summary mentions a striker named Keating, but there is no mention of a player with that name in the article.
4. The article states that Anderson has played for several clubs in the past, including Aldershot, Exeter, and Sligo Rovers, but there is no mention of these clubs in the summary.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions regarding Anderson's position, his previous club, and his playing history.
