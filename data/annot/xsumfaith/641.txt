Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the man was arrested on Wednesday and has now been bailed after being questioned by detectives. This implies that the arrest was made on a specific date in the past, Wednesday.
2. The summary only states that a man has been arrested "in connection with an attack on a 14-year-old girl in Birmingham". It does not specify the date of the arrest.
3. The article mentions that the girl was raped twice, once at the railway station and again in a vehicle in the Witton area. The summary does not mention the second rape or the fact that the girl was raped twice.
4. The article states that the driver of the second vehicle, described as a people carrier-type car, is believed to have given the victim a lift home after she was raped a second time. The summary does not mention this detail.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and specific information as the article. The summary only mentions the arrest of a man without providing any information about the date of the arrest, the second rape, or the Good Samaritan who picked up the victim.
