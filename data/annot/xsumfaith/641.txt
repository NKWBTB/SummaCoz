A man has been charged and another man arrested in connection with the first attack, which is being treated as a separate incident, the force said.
Meanwhile, detectives continue to appeal for a Good Samaritan who picked up the victim after she was raped for the second time.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the victim was raped twice, once at the railway station and again in a vehicle in the Witton area. However, the summary only mentions one rape incident.
2. The article mentions that the victim is 14 years old, but the summary does not include this detail.
3. The article states that the arrest is in connection with the rape of the teenager in a vehicle in the Witton area, but the summary only mentions an attack on a 14-year-old girl in Birmingham.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the arrest and the rape incidents. The summary should have included the fact that the victim was raped twice, and should have mentioned the age of the victim as 14 years old. Additionally, the summary should have been more specific about the location of the rape incidents, as the article provides more detail about the location of the second rape.
