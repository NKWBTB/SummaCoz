    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of rape in connection with an attack on a 14-year-old girl in Birmingham.
2. The article states that the man was arrested on Wednesday and had been bailed after being questioned by detectives. This implies that the man has not been charged with any crime yet.
3. The article also states that the man is being held in connection with the rape of the teenager in a vehicle in the Witton area at around 02:00 BST on 26 July. However, the summary does not mention anything about the rape happening in a vehicle.
4. The article mentions that the girl had previously been raped at the railway station hours earlier, but the summary does not include this information.
5. The article states that detectives are appealing for a Good Samaritan who picked up the victim after she was raped for the second time, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, based on the above points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions one arrest and one rape incident, while the article mentions two separate incidents and two arrests. Additionally, the summary does not include some of the information mentioned in the article, such as the fact that the girl was previously raped at the railway station and the appeal for a Good Samaritan.
