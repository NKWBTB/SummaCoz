<Article>
Walter Bartram was prospecting in dusty terrain in Coober Pedy, about 750km (466 miles) north of Adelaide, in 1946 when he staked a claim to what became called the Fire of Australia.
Although his family achieved success in opal trading, their greatest discovery has been seen rarely by the public.
That has just changed.
The 998g (35.2oz) opal, valued at nearly A$900,000 (Â£550,000; $680,000), is now on display in Adelaide's South Australian Museum.
Still largely in its original condition, the opal's two polished faces reveal a kaleidoscope of colours from green to yellow to red.
"When my father was alive, it was originally kept separately from all trading because it was such a significant piece," Alan Bartram told the BBC.
"We decided we would retain that intention, and keep it as a significant and obviously excellent example of light opal from South Australia."
The family has decided to pass it on for future generations to enjoy.
The museum's director, Brian Oldman, said the opal's rarity should not be underestimated.
"Opal of this quality can only be created under certain climate conditions," Mr Oldman said.
"When our state's inland sea evaporated millions of years ago, it provided a unique silica-rich environment for the creation of precious opal. It is these exceptional conditions that created the Fire of Australia."
A mining town for more than 100 years, Coober Pedy still draws people lured by the hope of striking it rich.
"They're becoming more scarce because the overheads of mining now are getting to be so expensive - in fuel, explosives, machinery and living costs on the field," Mr Bartram said.
"But South Australia supplies about 90% of the world's quality opals. There may be more major finds."

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "mines",
  "opal mines"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Fire of Australia opal was discovered by Walter Bartram in Coober Pedy in 1946.
2. The summary incorrectly states that one of the world's most rare opal mines is being put up for display in South Australia. This is not accurate, as the article only mentions one specific opal, the Fire of Australia, and not an entire mine.
3. The word "mines" is plural, indicating that there are multiple mines being referred to. However, the article only discusses one specific opal find, the Fire of Australia, and does not mention any other mines.
4. The word "opal mines" is also plural, indicating that there are multiple opal mines being referred to. However, as noted above, the article only discusses one specific opal find, the Fire of Australia, and does not mention any other opal mines.

Therefore, the spans "mines" and "opal mines" in the summary are not consistent with the article, as the article only discusses one specific opal find, not multiple mines or opal mines.
