    Summary: 
    one of the world\'s most rare opal mines is being put up for display in south australia. 

    Article: 
    Walter Bartram was prospecting in dusty terrain in Coober Pedy, about 750km (466 miles) north of Adelaide, in 1946 when he staked a claim to what became called the Fire of Australia.
Although his family achieved success in opal trading, their greatest discovery has been seen rarely by the public.
That has just changed.
The 998g (35.2oz) opal, valued at nearly A$900,000 (Â£550,000; $680,000), is now on display in Adelaide's South Australian Museum.
Still largely in its original condition, the opal's two polished faces reveal a kaleidoscope of colours from green to yellow to red.
"When my father was alive, it was originally kept separately from all trading because it was such a significant piece," Alan Bartram told the BBC.
"We decided we would retain that intention, and keep it as a significant and obviously excellent example of light opal from South Australia."
The family has decided to pass it on for future generations to enjoy.
The museum's director, Brian Oldman, said the opal's rarity should not be underestimated.
"Opal of this quality can only be created under certain climate conditions," Mr Oldman said.
"When our state's inland sea evaporated millions of years ago, it provided a unique silica-rich environment for the creation of precious opal. It is these exceptional conditions that created the Fire of Australia."
A mining town for more than 100 years, Coober Pedy still draws people lured by the hope of striking it rich.
"They're becoming more scarce because the overheads of mining now are getting to be so expensive - in fuel, explosives, machinery and living costs on the field," Mr Bartram said.
"But South Australia supplies about 90% of the world's quality opals. There may be more major finds."

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that one of the world's most rare opal mines is being put up for display, but the article does not mention anything about a mine being put up for display. Instead, the article focuses on a specific opal stone, the Fire of Australia, that was discovered by Walter Bartram in 1946.
2. The summary implies that the opal mine is being put on display for the public to see, but the article does not mention anything about the public being able to see the opal. Instead, the article states that the opal is now on display in Adelaide's South Australian Museum, but it is not clear if the public can view it.
3. The summary states that the opal mine is one of the world's most rare, but the article does not provide any information about the rarity of the mine. Instead, the article focuses on the rarity of the Fire of Australia opal stone and its value.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the opal being valued at nearly A$900,000, which is a key detail in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the focus of the article, exaggerates the rarity of the opal mine, and omits key details about the opal stone.
