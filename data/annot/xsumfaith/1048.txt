    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a motorcyclist killed in a crash with a tractor and a tractor in lincolnshire has been named.

    The crash happened at about 14:15 BST on the B1191 at Thornton, near Woodhall Spa.
Lincolnshire Police said the motorcyclist killed in the collision lived locally, but has not released any further details. The tractor driver was not injured.
The force has appealed for witnesses to the collision to come forward.
The B1191 was closed in both directions between the B1192 Tattershall Road junction in Woodhall Spa and the A158 Jubilee Way junction in Horncastle 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the motorcyclist was killed in a crash with a tractor, but the article does not mention any crash involving a tractor.
2. The summary states that the motorcyclist lived locally, but the article does not provide any information about the motorcyclist's residence or background.
3. The summary states that the tractor driver was not injured, but the article does not mention any injuries to the tractor driver.
4. The summary states that the B1191 was closed in both directions, but the article only mentions that the road was closed in one direction (between the B1192 Tattershall Road junction and the A158 Jubilee Way junction).

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies listed above, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
