The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night.
Davis tweeted "My touring caravan was stolen.. even though it was locked up with hitch & wheel lock! I want to swear... #rotters".
He added the thieves could have "headed north or south on A1, or west on A14".
Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have had a report of a caravan being stolen in the Yaxley area between 5pm on Thursday and 12.45pm on Friday. We are investigating."
Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII.
Davis's credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "ewok in return of the jedi",
  "warwick"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "ewok in return of the jedi": The article does not mention anything about Warwick Davis playing an Ewok in "Return of the Jedi." The correct information is that he played the role of Wicket in "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi."
2. "warwick": The article does not mention the name "Warwick" at all. The correct name is "Wicket."

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues in the following spans:

* "ewok in return of the jedi" - The Ewok character does not exist in "Return of the Jedi."
* "warwick" - There is no character named "Warwick" in the article.

To fix these consistency issues, the summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article. Here's a corrected summary:

<Summary>
Wicket Davis, who played the role of Wicket in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, has taken to Twitter to help recover his stolen caravan.
