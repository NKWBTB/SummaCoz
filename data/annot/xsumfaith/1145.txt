    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the company is switching to Android handsets in the UK, but the article does not mention anything about switching to Android handsets. Instead, the article states that the company has announced a new Android handset, the Dtek50, which offers improved security and will cost less than its previous handset, the Priv.
2. The summary implies that the company is switching away from its BB10 platform, but the article does not mention anything about the company abandoning its BB10 platform. Instead, the article states that the Dtek50 is the company's second Android handset, suggesting that the company is continuing to offer both Android and BB10 devices.
3. The summary suggests that the company is making this move to improve its devices, but the article does not provide any information about the company's motivations for releasing the Dtek50. Instead, the article focuses on the features and specifications of the new handset.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The article does not mention the company switching to Android handsets in the UK, and it does not suggest that the company is abandoning its BB10 platform. Additionally, the summary implies that the company is making this move to improve its devices, but the article does not provide any information about the company's motivations.
