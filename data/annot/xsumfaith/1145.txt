<Summary>
android handset has announced it is switching android handset in the uk.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the company is releasing a new Android handset, the Dtek50, which offers improved security over rival Android devices.
2. The article also mentions that the company is switching focus away from its BB10 platform.
3. However, the summary states that the company is switching its Android handset in the UK.
4. This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about switching the company's Android handset in the UK.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the information in the article.

Reasoning:

The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions switching the Android handset in the UK, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions the release of the Dtek50, a new Android handset with improved security, and the company's shift away from its BB10 platform.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions "android handset has announced it is switching android handset in the uk". The sentence does not make common sense as "android handset" can not make announcement.
2. The articles only mentions the company is releasing a new Android handset and the company is switching focus away from its BB10 platform.
3. The summary mentions switching the Android handset in the UK. However, this is not mentioned in the article.
