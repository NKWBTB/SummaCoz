Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Marjory Stewart is alleged to have crashed into three other vehicles, but the summary states that she injured four people. This is a discrepancy in the number of people injured.
2. The article states that the incident occurred in Portsoy in July, but the summary does not mention the location or the month. This information is not supported by the article.
3. The article states that Marjory Stewart is accused of failing to keep her car under proper control, but the summary does not mention any specific charges or allegations. This information is not supported by the article.

Based on these discrepancies, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, and it omits other important information that is included in the article.
