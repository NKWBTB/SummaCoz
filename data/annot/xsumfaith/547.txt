    Summary: 
    an 81-year-old woman is due in court charged with injuring four people-one seriously-while driving dangerously in an aberdeenshire village. 

    Article: 
    Marjory Stewart, of Bellshill, Lanarkshire, is alleged to have crashed into three other vehicles during the incident in Portsoy in July.
She is accused of failing to keep her car under proper control.
The case called at Banff Sheriff Court and was continued without plea until next month. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the 81-year-old woman is charged with injuring four people, but the article only mentions three other vehicles that were crashed into. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions one more person injured than the article does.

2. The summary states that the woman is due in court charged with driving dangerously, but the article only mentions that she is accused of failing to keep her car under proper control. The summary is not consistent with the article because it adds a more serious charge that is not mentioned in the article.

3. The article states that the case was continued without plea until next month, but the summary does not mention this detail. The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information from the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains additional information that is not supported by the article and leaves out important details that are included in the article.
