"We await the decision of the IPCC and will not be commenting further as the criminal investigation is now in the court process."
On Thursday Mr Tenniswood appeared at Northampton Crown Court via video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.
When asked if he could hear, Mr Tenniswood told the clerk of the court: "I can hear you, definitely."
After that he spoke only to confirm he could see the Judge Rupert Mayo, prosecutor Mary Loram and his lawyer Derek Johashen.
There was no application for bail and he was remanded in custody.
Ms Chipchase was last seen by friends on Bridge Street at about 01:15 GMT on Saturday.
Her disappearance was reported later that day after she failed to turn up to work at The Collingtree pub and restaurant.
Her body was found at the defendant's terraced house in Stanley Road. A post-mortem examination concluded she died as a result of pressure to the neck.
There will be a plea hearing on the 25 May, and a trial date was set for 18 July, to last for 10 days.

<Summary>
a police watchdog has referred its response to the police complaints commission\'s decision not to investigate the case of a student found dead in a house.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a police watchdog has referred its response to the police complaints commission's decision not to investigate the case of a student found dead in a house.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the police complaints commission deciding not to investigate the case. Instead, it states that Northamptonshire Police has made a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to ensure transparency in examining police action and responses before and during the search for India Chipchase.
3. The article also mentions that the IPCC will be investigating the case, and that the police force will not be commenting further as the criminal investigation is now in the court process.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the police watchdog has referred its response to the police complaints commission's decision not to investigate the case, when in fact the IPCC is investigating the case.
5. The summary also fails to mention the key details of the case, such as the discovery of India Chipchase's body and the arrest and charging of Edward Tenniswood with murder.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article and does not provide a clear understanding of the case.
