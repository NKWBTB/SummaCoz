A statement issued by the force said: "Northamptonshire Police has made a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to ensure transparency in examining police action and responses before and during the search for India Chipchase.
"We await the decision of the IPCC and will not be commenting further as the criminal investigation is now in the court process."
On Thursday Mr Tenniswood appeared at Northampton Crown Court via video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.
When asked if he could hear, Mr Tenniswood told the clerk of the court: "I can hear you, definitely."
After that he spoke only to confirm he could see the Judge Rupert Mayo, prosecutor Mary Loram and his lawyer Derek Johashen.
There was no application for bail and he was remanded in custody.
Ms Chipchase was last seen by friends on Bridge Street at about 01:15 GMT on Saturday.
Her disappearance was reported later that day after she failed to turn up to work at The Collingtree pub and restaurant.
Her body was found at the defendant's terraced house in Stanley Road. A post-mortem examination concluded she died as a result of pressure to the neck.
There will be a plea hearing on the 25 May, and a trial date was set for 18 July, to last for 10 days. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the police watchdog has referred its response to the police complaints commission's decision not to investigate the case.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the police complaints commission or its decision not to investigate the case.
3. Instead, the article states that Northamptonshire Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over its "responses before and during" the search for India Chipchase.
4. The article also mentions that the IPCC will decide whether to investigate the case, but it does not say that the commission has decided not to investigate.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the police complaints commission has decided not to investigate the case, whereas the article only mentions that the police have referred themselves to the IPCC for examination of their responses.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it adds an extra detail (the police complaints commission's decision not to investigate) that is not present in the article.
