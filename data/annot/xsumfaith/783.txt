    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    fire services in west sussex have been told they will not be allowed to visit the county antrim area fire service. 

    Article: 
    The move is part of national fire service reforms unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May last week.
Sussex PCC Katy Bourne said emergency services would have an increased duty to collaborate under the new bill.
But West Sussex County Council (WSCC) said it already had an excellent model.
East Sussex's fire authority said it would co-operate with the PCC but it believed collaboration could be achieved without elaborate structural change.
Ms Bourne said she had written to WSCC leader Louise Goldsmith and Phil Howson, East Sussex Fire Authority chairman, to request they begin to look at the feasibility of bringing both fire services under her authority.
"Just as we have one police force that effectively manages the county, we need to understand if one fire service not two could achieve the same," she said.
Ms Bourne's letter met with cross-party opposition from WSCC.
And Ms Goldsmith also invited the home secretary to visit West Sussex and see an alternative to the government's preferred plan.
Ms Goldsmith said West Sussex fire service was already integrated within the council and served communities.
She added last year's Shoreham air disaster showed how West Sussex emergency services already worked together.
East Sussex Fire Authority said it was willing to co-operate with the PCC to determine whether proposals could improve delivery of services and create efficiencies.
In a statement, it added: "[The fire authority] believes whilst close collaboration between the emergency services is essential, it can be achieved without elaborate structural change.
"It is also the fire authority's considered view that it is more accountable to the community it serves because its members are elected councillors." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that fire services in West Sussex will not be allowed to visit the County Antrim area fire service, but the article does not mention anything about visiting or traveling restrictions.

2. The article focuses on national fire service reforms and the potential collaboration between fire services in East and West Sussex, but the summary does not mention any of these details.

3. The summary mentions a letter written by the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Katy Bourne to West Sussex County Council (WSCC) and East Sussex Fire Authority, but the article does not mention any such letter or request.

4. The summary states that WSCC opposes the PCC's request, but the article does not mention any opposition or resistance from WSCC.

5. The article mentions that East Sussex Fire Authority is willing to cooperate with the PCC to determine whether proposals could improve service delivery and create efficiencies, but the summary does not mention any such cooperation or willingness.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary appears to be a standalone statement that is not supported by the information in the article.
