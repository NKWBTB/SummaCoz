    Summary: 
    bournemouth manager eddie howe says his side\'s " lack of confidence " in their bid to win a top-six premier league away from premier league relegation 

    Article: 
    The Cherries went down 2-1 at Sunderland on Saturday, becoming the first team to lose to the Black Cats in the Premier League this season.
Dan Gosling's goal, which gave them the lead, was their first for three games.
"It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games."
He continued: "A couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take."
Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser, even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar's dismissal.
"We've had enough chances to win three games today," Howe added.
"Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it. It's how you move on from that which is key." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Eddie Howe, the manager of Bournemouth, said that his team's lack of confidence is the reason for their poor performance.
2. However, the article quotes Eddie Howe as saying that the team's lack of confidence is not the reason for their poor performance. Instead, he points out that they have created enough chances to win three games.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents what Eddie Howe said. The article quotes him as saying that the team's poor performance is not due to a lack of confidence, but rather due to their inability to convert their chances into goals.
4. The summary's statement that the team's "lack of confidence" is the reason for their poor performance is not supported by the article. Instead, the article suggests that the team's poor performance is due to their inability to score goals, despite creating enough chances to win three games.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents what Eddie Howe said and suggests that the team's poor performance is due to a lack of confidence, when the article suggests that it is due to their inability to score goals.
