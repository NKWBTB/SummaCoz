    Summary: 
    singapore has become the first country in indonesia to sign a ban on the sale of smog. 

    Article: 
    Seven firms, including major supermarkets such as NTUC FairPrice and IKEA, have been asked declare they are not doing so within a week.
The forest fires in Indonesia have deteriorated Singapore's air quality, causing a blanket of haze in the city.
FairPrice has said it removing products from one Indonesian firm.
The state-owned supermarket giant said that it was removing all paper products sourced from Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the notification from the government.
APP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze.
What is behind the South East Asia haze?
In a joint statement, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have "not procured or used wood, paper and/or pulp materials" from firms accused of contributing to the fires.
The SEC said retailers were "a good starting point" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and "for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices"
The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region. It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month, in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Anger has been rising in the region, with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Singapore has become the first country in Indonesia to sign a ban on the sale of smog. This is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of Indonesia signing a ban on the sale of smog. Instead, the article focuses on Singapore's efforts to address the haze caused by forest fires in Indonesia.
2. The article states that seven firms, including major supermarkets such as NTUC FairPrice and IKEA, have been asked to declare that they are not using wood, paper, and/or pulp materials from firms accused of contributing to the fires. The summary does not mention anything about these firms being asked to make such a declaration.
3. The article mentions that the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) have asked retailers to declare that they have not procured or used wood, paper, and/or pulp materials from firms accused of contributing to the fires. The summary does not mention anything about these organizations or their efforts to address the haze.
4. The article states that the haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region, leading to the cancellation of public events and school closures. The summary does not mention anything about the haze or its impact on air quality.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary focuses on a ban on the sale of smog, which is not mentioned in the article, and leaves out important details about the efforts of the Singapore Environment Council and Consumers Association of Singapore to address the haze caused by forest fires in Indonesia.
