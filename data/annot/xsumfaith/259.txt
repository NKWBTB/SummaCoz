Find out why.

<Article>
Seven firms, including major supermarkets such as NTUC FairPrice and IKEA, have been asked declare they are not doing so within a week.
The forest fires in Indonesia have deteriorated Singapore's air quality, causing a blanket of haze in the city.
FairPrice has said it removing products from one Indonesian firm.
The state-owned supermarket giant said that it was removing all paper products sourced from Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the notification from the government.
APP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze.
What is behind the South East Asia haze?
In a joint statement, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have "not procured or used wood, paper and/or pulp materials" from firms accused of contributing to the fires.
The SEC said retailers were "a good starting point" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and "for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices"
The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region. It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month, in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Anger has been rising in the region, with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations.

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Singapore has been affected by haze caused by forest fires in Indonesia, and the government has asked retailers to declare that they have not procured or used wood, paper, and/or pulp materials from firms accused of contributing to the fires.
2. The summary claims that Singapore has become the first country in Indonesia to sign a ban on the sale of smog.
3. However, the article does not mention anything about Singapore signing a ban on the sale of smog. Instead, it mentions that the government has asked retailers to declare their commitment to sustainable procurement processes.
4. The phrase "sign a ban on the sale of smog" is not consistent with the content of the article. There is no mention of a ban on the sale of smog in the article, and the focus is on retailers declaring their commitment to sustainable procurement processes.
5. Therefore, the spans in the summary that have consistency issues are "first country", "sign a ban on the sale of smog", and "singapore has become the first country in indonesia to sign a ban on the sale of smog". These statements are not supported by the content of the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It contains several inconsistencies and inaccuracies that need to be addressed before it can be considered a reliable summary of the article.
