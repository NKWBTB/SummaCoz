</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that former world champions Colin Nixon and Holly Nixon have been named in Great Britain's squad for the quadruple European championships in Romania.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Colin Nixon or Holly Nixon being in the squad for the European championships.
3. In fact, the article states that Holly Nixon was not successful in the women's quadruple sculls, finishing fifth in a race won by Poland.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it makes a claim about the squad for the European championships that is not supported by the article.
