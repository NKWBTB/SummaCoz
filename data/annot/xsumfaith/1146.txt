    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that former world champions Colin Nixon and Holly Nixon have been named in Great Britain's squad for the quadruple European championships in Romania.

2. However, the article does not mention anything about Colin Nixon being named in the squad. It only mentions Holly Nixon, who was part of the women's quadruple sculls team that finished fifth in their race.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Colin Nixon, who does not exist in the article.

4. Additionally, the article does not mention anything about Great Britain winning the quadruple European championships or any other medals, which contradicts the summary's statement that Great Britain won the quadruple European championships.

5. Overall, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the information in the article.
