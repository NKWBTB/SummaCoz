<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the incident occurred in Coatbridge, but the summary only mentions "north Lanarkshire". This is not consistent, as Coatbridge is a specific location within Lanarkshire, and the summary does not provide any information about the location of the incident.
2. The article states that the boy was struck by a car, but the summary only mentions being "hit" by a car. This is not consistent, as "struck" is a more specific and accurate term than "hit".
3. The article provides the name of the hospital where the boy was taken, but the summary does not mention the hospital. This is not consistent, as the article provides relevant information about the boy's medical treatment that is not included in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the location, the nature of the incident, and the medical treatment received by the boy.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions a nine-year-old boy. However, the article does not mention the age of the boy.
