    Summary: 
    wales and ospreys scrum-half rhys webb says he hopes to return to the ospreys back to wales. 

    Article: 
    Webb has not played since suffering a serious foot injury in a World Cup warm-up with Italy in September.
The 27-year-old says he is close to a return, giving him time to get fit before the Six Nations in February.
"I'm back up and running now and going through a pre-season sort of stage at the moment. It's all coming along well," he said.
"I'm going to take each week as it comes now and see where I am then.
"It's been talked about [returning] at the beginning of February, but I did ask the physios if they could scrape a couple of weeks off that and they said 'yes'."
Wales begin their Six Nations campaign away to Ireland in Dublin on Sunday, 7 February.
Webb, capped 16 times by Wales, has renewed his national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union.
He turned down offers from elsewhere to stay at the region for whom he made his debut in 2007.
"It's my home region and I enjoy the club," Webb told BBC Wales' Scrum V Live.
"I want to put myself in the best possible position to play for my country and I'm not going to give that up that easy.
"Wales and the Ospreys came together and I'm happy to get it done." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Rhys Webb hopes to return to the Ospreys back to Wales. However, the article does not mention anything about Webb wanting to return to the Ospreys. Instead, it states that he is close to a return from a foot injury and is focused on getting fit for the Six Nations.
2. The summary also implies that Webb has been playing for the Ospreys, but the article states that he has not played since suffering a serious foot injury in a World Cup warm-up with Italy in September.
3. The summary mentions that Webb has renewed his national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary suggests that Webb is looking to return to Wales, but the article does not provide any information about him wanting to leave the Ospreys or return to Wales.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not support the statement that Rhys Webb hopes to return to the Ospreys back to Wales. Instead, it focuses on his recovery from a foot injury and his desire to play for Wales in the Six Nations.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Rhys Webb hopes to return to the Ospreys back to Wales. However, the article does not mention anything about Webb wanting to return to the Ospreys. Instead, it states that he is close to a return from a foot injury and is focused on getting fit for the Six Nations.
