    Summary: 
    the scottish dairy industry has reported a pre-tax profit of £1. 5m for 2015. 

    Article: 
    Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016.
This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m.
Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield.
The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors.
It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear.
In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict.
"We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one.
"The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Scottish dairy industry reported a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for 2015.
2. However, the article states that Harbro Group, a company based in Aberdeenshire, reported a pre-tax profit of £3.5m for the year to the end of June 2016.
3. This means that the information in the summary is not consistent with the information in the article, as the profit reported by Harbro Group is higher than the profit reported for the Scottish dairy industry.
4. The article states that Harbro Group's pre-tax profit increased by £800,000 to £3.5m, despite a fall in turnover of £1m to £100m.
5. This suggests that the company's international sales grew over the year, which is not mentioned in the summary.
6. The article also mentions that the company has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, which is not mentioned in the summary.
7. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the information in the article, as it does not include all of the information reported in the article.
