<Article>
Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016.
This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m.
Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield.
The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors.
It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear.
In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict.
"We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one.
"The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Harbro Group saw a pre-tax profit increase of £800,000 to £3.5m in the year to the end of June 2016.
2. The summary states that the Scottish dairy industry has reported a pre-tax profit of £1.5m for 2015.
3. The article does not mention anything about the Scottish dairy industry or dairy farming. It only mentions that Harbro Group is based in Aberdeenshire and manufactures and supplies feeds for various animal sectors.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions the Scottish dairy industry, while the article only discusses Harbro Group's financial performance.
5. The reason for the inconsistency is likely that the person who wrote the summary mistakenly included information about the Scottish dairy industry, which is not related to Harbro Group or the article.
