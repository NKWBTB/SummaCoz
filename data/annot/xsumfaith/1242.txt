Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Carwyn Jones, the First Minister of Wales, has accused Theresa May of being the "worst possible leader" for the UK during the Brexit negotiations.
2. However, the summary states that Carwyn Jones has announced that Wales has been sold out.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. The article states that Carwyn Jones has accused Theresa May of being a bad leader, while the summary states that Wales has been sold out.
4. The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary is not accurately representing the content of the article. The article does not mention anything about Wales being sold out, and the quote from Carwyn Jones is not about Wales being sold out, but rather about Theresa May being a bad leader.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is not an accurate representation of the content of the article.
