    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The summary states that Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, has announced that Wales has announced that "it will not support the UK's exit from the EU."
    2. However, the article states that Mr. Jones said that Mrs. May is the "best leader the Tory party has had for a long time."
    3. This implies that Mr. Jones does not support the UK's exit from the EU, which contradicts the summary.
    4. The article also mentions that the Welsh Government has been critical of the UK government's handling of Brexit, and that Mr. Jones has called for a "soft Brexit."
    5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect Mr. Jones' position on the UK's exit from the EU.
