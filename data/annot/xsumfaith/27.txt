</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that a 32-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene, but the summary states that a motorcyclist has been arrested. This is inconsistent, as there is no mention of a motorcyclist in the article.
2. The article states that the crash involved several vehicles, but the summary only mentions a lorry and another lorry. This is inconsistent, as the article mentions more than two vehicles were involved in the crash.
3. The article states that the 33-year-old man from Waterlooville was arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention, but the summary states that the motorcyclist has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. This is inconsistent, as the article does not mention dangerous driving, only driving without due care and attention.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
