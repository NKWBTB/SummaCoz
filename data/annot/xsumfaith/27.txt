    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a motorcyclist was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, but the article does not mention anything about the motorcyclist being arrested. Instead, it mentions that a 33-year-old man from Waterlooville was arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention.
2. The summary states that there was a crash between a lorry and a motorcycle, but the article does not mention a motorcycle. Instead, it mentions that several vehicles were involved in the crash.
3. The summary states that the crash happened on the southbound carriageway, near the Hindhead tunnel at Bramshott, but the article does not mention the location of the crash.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies between the summary and the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and contains errors.
