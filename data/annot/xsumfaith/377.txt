</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident occurred in Coatbridge, not Glasgow. The summary incorrectly states that the incident occurred in Glasgow.
2. The article states that the boy was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, which is located in Glasgow. However, the summary does not mention the hospital or the location of the incident.
3. The article describes the boy as being "badly injured" and his condition as "serious". The summary does not provide any information about the severity of the boy's injuries.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the location of the incident, fails to mention the hospital where the boy was taken, and does not provide information about the severity of the boy's injuries.
