Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "against Manchester United": The article does not mention that Wayne Rooney's testimonial is against Manchester United. In fact, the article states that the game is being played at Old Trafford, which is the home stadium of Manchester United, but it does not specify that the opposing team is Manchester United. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
2. "wayne": The article does not mention Wayne Rooney's name at all. The article only mentions "Rooney's testimonial game" and "Rooney's four chosen charities." Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
3. "against": The article does not mention anything about Wayne Rooney playing against any team. The game is described as Rooney's testimonial game, which suggests that it is a game featuring Rooney and his selected team, rather than a game against an opposing team. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
4. "live": The article does not mention anything about the game being broadcast live. It only mentions that the game will be streamed globally, which suggests that it will be available to watch online, but it does not specify that it will be broadcast live. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several phrases that are not consistent with the article. These phrases were likely added based on assumptions or misreadings of the article, rather than being directly supported by the text.
