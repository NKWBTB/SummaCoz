    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Wayne Rooney's testimonial against Manchester United was broadcast live on Facebook.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the testimonial being broadcast live on Facebook. Instead, it states that the game will be available to 1.7 billion people on the platform worldwide via Rooney's and Manchester United's Facebook pages.
3. The article emphasizes that the game will be available on demand, not live. This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that the testimonial was broadcast live when, in fact, it will be available on demand.
4. Furthermore, the summary mentions nothing about the game being available on demand or the proceeds going to charity, which are both important details mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be an inaccurate or incomplete summary of the information provided.
