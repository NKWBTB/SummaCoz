</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Wayne Rooney's testimonial was broadcast live on Facebook.
2. The article does not mention anything about the testimonial being broadcast live on Facebook.
3. The article only mentions that the game will be available to 1.7 billion people on the platform worldwide via Rooney's and Manchester United's Facebook pages, but it does not specify that the game will be broadcast live.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the testimonial was broadcast live on Facebook, while the article only mentions that the game will be available on demand on Facebook.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it adds an additional detail that is not present in the article, which is that the testimonial was broadcast live on Facebook.
