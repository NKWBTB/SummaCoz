<Article>
Health Inspectorate Wales said Wrexham Maelor Hospital staff were under "considerable pressure" for long periods as ambulances waited outside.
It said inspectors were told the situation was not unusual.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was working to manage the pressures.
Inspectors visited the A&E unit and another ward on 30 September and 1 October last year and have released reports about what they found.
Despite the pressures in A&E they said staff were observed to be effectively prioritising clinical need and patient care.
On the Mason Ward, inspectors found patients to be well looked after and said staff were committed to providing good standards of care.
Angela Hopkins, executive director of nursing and midwifery at the health board, said its hospitals were experiencing growing demand like the rest of the UK.
"We are focussing on the improvement of emergency department and ward processes for both admission and discharge to reduce delays," she said.
"We are increasing the numbers of nursing staff and extra beds have been opened.
"We are also working in partnership with local authorities and the Welsh Ambulance Service to ensure that the system works more smoothly to improve patient flow through the hospital."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the Health Inspectorate Wales found that staff at Wrexham Maelor Hospital were under "considerable pressure" due to long wait times for ambulances, but the summary does not mention anything about the number of hospital beds.
2. The article states that the health board is working to manage the pressures and improve patient flow through the hospital, but the summary does not mention any of these efforts.
3. The article mentions that despite the pressures in A&E, staff were observed to be effectively prioritizing clinical need and patient care, but the summary does not mention this positive aspect of the hospital's performance.
4. The summary states that the number of hospital beds at the hospital has fallen to its lowest level in three years, but the article does not mention this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary focuses only on one aspect of the article (the number of hospital beds), while neglecting other important information (the pressures faced by staff, the efforts to improve patient flow, and the positive aspects of the hospital's performance).
