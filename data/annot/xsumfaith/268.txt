    Summary: 
    the number of hospital beds at a north wales hospital has fallen to its lowest level in three years. 

    Article: 
    Health Inspectorate Wales said Wrexham Maelor Hospital staff were under "considerable pressure" for long periods as ambulances waited outside.
It said inspectors were told the situation was not unusual.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was working to manage the pressures.
Inspectors visited the A&E unit and another ward on 30 September and 1 October last year and have released reports about what they found.
Despite the pressures in A&E they said staff were observed to be effectively prioritising clinical need and patient care.
On the Mason Ward, inspectors found patients to be well looked after and said staff were committed to providing good standards of care.
Angela Hopkins, executive director of nursing and midwifery at the health board, said its hospitals were experiencing growing demand like the rest of the UK.
"We are focussing on the improvement of emergency department and ward processes for both admission and discharge to reduce delays," she said.
"We are increasing the numbers of nursing staff and extra beds have been opened.
"We are also working in partnership with local authorities and the Welsh Ambulance Service to ensure that the system works more smoothly to improve patient flow through the hospital." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the number of hospital beds at a North Wales hospital has fallen to its lowest level in three years.

However, the article does not mention anything about the number of hospital beds falling. Instead, it talks about the pressures faced by staff at the hospital and the health board's efforts to improve the situation.

2. The article mentions that inspectors found that staff were under "considerable pressure" for long periods, and that the situation was not unusual.

This suggests that the hospital is experiencing high demand and that the staff are working under challenging conditions. However, it does not support the claim that the number of hospital beds has fallen.

3. The article also mentions that the health board is working to manage the pressures and improve the situation.

This suggests that the health board is taking steps to address the issues at the hospital, but it does not support the claim that the number of hospital beds has fallen.

4. The article does mention that the health board is increasing the numbers of nursing staff and opening extra beds, but this is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim about the number of hospital beds falling, which is not supported by the article. The article focuses on the pressures faced by staff and the health board's efforts to improve the situation, rather than the number of hospital beds.
