]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Adrian Fatchett was injured at a house in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South. There is no mention of a party or any event taking place at the house.
2. The summary states that Adrian Fatchett died after suffering a serious head injury at a party in Barnsley. This is not supported by the article, which does not mention any party or event taking place in Barnsley.
3. The article does mention that Adrian Fatchett was treated at the scene by paramedics, but there is no mention of a head injury. The article only states that he was injured.
4. The summary also mentions a 17-year-old boy being arrested on suspicion of murder, but this is not mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as a party in Barnsley and a head injury. Additionally, the summary omits important details that are present in the article, such as the fact that Adrian Fatchett was treated by paramedics and that a 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder.
