Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Adrian Fatchett died after suffering a serious head injury, but the summary does not mention anything about a head injury.
2. The article states that the death occurred at a house in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South, but the summary does not provide any information about the location of the incident.
3. The article states that the 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder, but the summary does not mention anything about an arrest or suspicion of murder.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information as the article. The summary only provides a brief statement about the name of the deceased, but it does not provide any details about the circumstances of the death or the investigation.
