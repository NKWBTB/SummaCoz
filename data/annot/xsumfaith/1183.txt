    Summary: 
    a judge in arkansas has refused to apologise to the family of an american couple shot dead in the us. 

    Article: 
    Police in Arkansas wish to unlock an iPhone and iPod belonging to two teenagers accused of killing a couple, according to the Associated Press (AP).
Less than a day after its San Bernardino announcement, the FBI agreed to help in the homicide case.
Syed Farook and his wife were shot dead after killing 14 people in December.
A judge agreed to postpone the Arkansas case on 28 March to allow prosecutors to ask the FBI for help.
Hunter Drexler, 18, and Justin Staton, 15, are accused of killing Robert and Patricia Cogdell at their home in Conway, Arkansas last July.
Staton had been raised as a grandson by the Cogdells.
"We always appreciate [the FBI's] cooperation and willingness to help their local law enforcement partners," Faulkner County prosecuting attorney Cody Hilland told the AP.
An attorney for Mr Drexler told the AP he was "not concerned" about any data on the phone.
Previously, the FBI had asked Apple to write new software that would allow it to gain access to Farook's iPhone.
However, the company refused, arguing it would be wrong to compromise the security of one of its devices since that might lead to vulnerabilities in many other iPhones.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions a judge refusing to apologize to the family of an American couple shot dead, but the article does not mention any apology or the family of the couple.
2. The summary mentions the FBI agreeing to help in a homicide case, but the article does not mention any homicide case or the FBI's involvement in one.
3. The summary mentions the FBI asking Apple to write new software to gain access to an iPhone, but the article does not mention any iPhone or Apple.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article. The article is about the FBI asking for help in a case involving two teenagers accused of killing a couple in Arkansas, and the FBI's request for help from Apple in gaining access to an iPhone. The summary, on the other hand, is about a judge refusing to apologize to the family of an American couple shot dead, which is not present in the article.
