    Summary: 
    a man who was kidnapped in mexico city centre has been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and murder of a olympiakos fan. 

    Article: 
    Pulido, who plays for the Greek club, Olympiakos, cut his wrist when he punched a glass pane on a door as he tried to escape before police arrived.
Pulido, 25, was abducted at gunpoint on Saturday night in his home town of Ciudad Victoria in Tamaulipas state.
A 38-year-old man has been arrested.
Officials say the man had confessed to belonging to a local criminal gang. Police are searching for another three men believed to have been involved in the kidnapping.
State prosecutor Ismael Quintanilla said the masked gang had taken Pulido to a house in Ciudad Victoria where he eventually found himself alone with one of his abductors.
"They traded blows. He takes it [the phone] and calls [emergency number] 066. It all happened very quickly," Mr Quintanilla told Imagen radio.
An official report of the calls Pulido made to the emergency operator, obtained by the Associated Press, revealed that he threatened and beat the kidnapper while on the phone, demanding to be told where they were.
In one of the calls, Pulido said police were outside and starting to shoot so he described what he was wearing to avoid being mistaken for a kidnapper.
Pulido had been abducted when his car was surrounded by several vehicles as he was leaving a party with his girlfriend on Saturday night.
Masked men whisked him away, leaving his girlfriend unharmed.
Pulido's family received a phone call on Sunday demanding a ransom payment, Mr Quintanilla told reporters. No ransom was paid.
Pulido, with one of his hands bandaged, told reporters early on Monday: "[I am] very well, thank God."
Tamaulipas is one of Mexico's most violent states, and Mexico recently deployed more security forces to tackle cartels operating in the area.
The country has one of the world's highest kidnapping rates, with government figures saying some 1,000 people are abducted every year.
Pulido joined Olympiakos last July and finished the season with six goals in 15 games.
He was part of Mexico's squad at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but was not called up for the upcoming Copa America tournament.

Step 1: Identify the key points in the summary.

* The summary states that a man who was kidnapped in Mexico City Centre has been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and murder of an Olympiakos fan.

Step 2: Identify the key points in the article.

* The article states that Pulido, an Olympiakos player, was abducted at gunpoint in his home town of Ciudad Victoria in Tamaulipas state.
* Pulido was able to escape by punching a glass pane on a door and calling the emergency services.
* A 38-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the kidnapping, and police are searching for three other men believed to have been involved.
* Pulido threatened and beat one of his abductors while on the phone with the emergency services, demanding to be told where they were.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies between the summary and the article.

* The summary states that the man who was arrested was involved in the kidnapping and murder of an Olympiakos fan, but the article does not mention any details about a murder or the identity of the victim.
* The summary states that the man was arrested in Mexico City Centre, but the article states that the kidnapping took place in Ciudad Victoria, which is not the same location.

Step 4: Explain why the summary is not consistent with the article.

* The summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as the murder of an Olympiakos fan and the location of the arrest being Mexico City Centre. These details are not supported by the information in the article, and therefore the summary is not an accurate representation of the content.
