    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    gunmen have attacked two offices in the turkish capital, istanbul, killing two people and injuring several other people. 

    Article: 
    The daily Yeni Safak said its offices and those of Yeni Akit were attacked. No casualties were reported.
It said four masked assailants attacked the Yeni Safak building. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze.
Police have cordoned off the area around the building.
The two papers support the governing AK Party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Yeni Akit offices are 20km (12 miles) away from the Yeni Safak building, and the night-time attacks happened almost at the same time, early on Thursday.
Windows in both buildings were shattered by the gunfire, Istanbul police said.
"Numerous spent bullet casings were also found at both scenes," the police added. They are now hunting the assailants.
So far no group has claimed it was behind the attacks.
Last September, pro-government protesters attacked the offices of the daily Hurriyet, accusing the paper of misquoting President Erdogan. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that gunmen attacked two offices in Istanbul, killing two people and injuring several others.

2. However, the article states that there were no casualties reported and that the attack only damaged the buildings' windows.

3. The summary mentions that the two attacked buildings supported the governing AK Party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while the article does not mention this detail.

4. The article states that the attacks happened almost at the same time, early on Thursday, but the summary does not mention this detail.

5. The article mentions that police are hunting the assailants, but the summary does not mention this detail.

6. The article mentions that no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the summary does not mention this detail.

7. Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary includes details that are not present in the article, and omits other important details that are present in the article. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
