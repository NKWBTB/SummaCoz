Find out why.

<Article>
The daily Yeni Safak said its offices and those of Yeni Akit were attacked. No casualties were reported.
It said four masked assailants attacked the Yeni Safak building. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze.
Police have cordoned off the area around the building.
The two papers support the governing AK Party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Yeni Akit offices are 20km (12 miles) away from the Yeni Safak building, and the night-time attacks happened almost at the same time, early on Thursday.
Windows in both buildings were shattered by the gunfire, Istanbul police said.
"Numerous spent bullet casings were also found at both scenes," the police added. They are now hunting the assailants.
So far no group has claimed it was behind the attacks.
Last September, pro-government protesters attacked the offices of the daily Hurriyet, accusing the paper of misquoting President Erdogan.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "no casualties were reported" after the attack on the Yeni Safak and Yeni Akit offices. This means that no one was killed or injured during the attack.
2. The summary, on the other hand, states that "gunmen have attacked two offices in the Turkish capital, Istanbul, killing two people and injuring several other people." This is not consistent with the article, as there were no casualties reported.
3. The summary also states that the attack resulted in the deaths of two people, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that the windows in both buildings were shattered by the gunfire and that police have cordoned off the area.
4. The summary does not provide any information about the identity of the attackers or their motives, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that police are hunting the assailants and that no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains several inaccuracies.
