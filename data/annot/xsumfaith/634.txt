Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the GB women's eight finished fifth in the race, but the summary claims that Rebecca Shorten won a bronze medal. This is inconsistent, as there is no mention of Shorten winning a bronze medal in the article.
2. The article does not mention the city of Belfast or Rebecca Shorten winning a bronze medal. The only mention of Shorten is in the context of the GB women's eight finishing fifth.
3. The summary is not supported by the information in the article, as there is no evidence to suggest that Shorten won a bronze medal or that the GB women's eight finished with a medal at all.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the spans highlighted in the question are the ones that have consistency issues.
