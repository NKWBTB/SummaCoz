UK-based Chatham House says more needs to be done to protect key transport routes such as the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal and the Turkish Straits.
Almost 25% of the world's food is traded on international markets.
This, the report says, makes food supply and prices vulnerable to unforeseen crises or climate change.
Infrastructure at the chokepoints is often old and would struggle to cope with natural disasters which are expected to grow in frequency as the planet warms, the report authors add.
They urge governments to invest in "climate-resilient" infrastructure, and diversify food production and stocks.
The report gives examples of how reliant the world is on this trade:
"The risks are growing as we all trade more with each other and as climate change takes hold," says Laura Wellesley, one of the study's authors.
There are risks for both the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food, she added.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Chatham House is urging governments to invest in "climate-resilient" infrastructure to protect key transport routes, such as the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, and the Turkish Straits, due to the vulnerability of food supply and prices to unforeseen crises or climate change.
2. The summary, on the other hand, states that the World Health Organization (WHO) is "very concerned" about the impact of climate change.
3. There is no mention of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it refers to a different organization (WHO) and a different issue (climate change impact) than the article.
