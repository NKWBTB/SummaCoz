    Summary: 
    the world health organization (who) says it is ``very concerned\'\'about the impact of climate change and climate change. 

    Article: 
    UK-based Chatham House says more needs to be done to protect key transport routes such as the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal and the Turkish Straits.
Almost 25% of the world's food is traded on international markets.
This, the report says, makes food supply and prices vulnerable to unforeseen crises or climate change.
Infrastructure at the chokepoints is often old and would struggle to cope with natural disasters which are expected to grow in frequency as the planet warms, the report authors add.
They urge governments to invest in "climate-resilient" infrastructure, and diversify food production and stocks.
The report gives examples of how reliant the world is on this trade:
"The risks are growing as we all trade more with each other and as climate change takes hold," says Laura Wellesley, one of the study's authors.
There are risks for both the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food, she added. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the World Health Organization (WHO) is "very concerned" about the impact of climate change. However, the article does not mention the WHO at all. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The article focuses on the vulnerability of international food trade to climate change, specifically highlighting the importance of key transport routes such as the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, and the Turkish Straits. The summary does not mention anything about food trade or transport routes.
3. The article emphasizes the need for "climate-resilient" infrastructure and diversifying food production and stocks to mitigate the risks of climate change. The summary does not mention any solutions or recommendations for addressing the impact of climate change on food trade.
4. The article quotes Laura Wellesley, one of the study's authors, who highlights the risks to both the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food. The summary does not include any quotes or perspectives from the study's authors.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
