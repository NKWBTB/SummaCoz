</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is dated March 23, 2017, while the summary is not dated.
2. The article states that the Northern Ireland Secretary, Martin McGuinness, has resigned, while the summary only mentions that he is "shocked" by the outcome of the assembly election.
3. The article provides specific information about McGuinness's resignation, including the reason for his resignation (he had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer) and the timing of his resignation (he stepped down on March 23, 2017).
4. The summary does not provide any information about McGuinness's resignation or the reason for his resignation.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief statement about McGuinness's reaction to the assembly election outcome, while the article provides much more detailed information about his resignation.
