    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is dated March 23, 2017, and the summary is talking about the outcome of the assembly election.
2. The article does not mention anything about Martin McGuinness being shocked by the outcome of the election. In fact, the article states that Sinn FÃ©in, the party led by McGuinness, made significant gains in the election.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it attributes a quote to McGuinness that is not present in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it includes a quote from McGuinness that is not supported by the text of the article.
