</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "northern ireland secretary martin mcguinness says he\\'s \" shocked \" by the outcome of the assembly election"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is dated March 23, 2017, while the summary is not specific to a date.

2. The article states that Martin McGuinness is "shocked" by the outcome of the assembly election, but the summary does not include this information.

3. The summary only mentions Martin McGuinness's position as Northern Ireland Secretary, while the article mentions his role as a former IRA leader and his reaction to the election results.

4. The summary does not include any information about the election results or the reasons for McGuinness's alleged shock, which are the main focuses of the article.

5. The inconsistency between the summary and the article is evident because the summary does not provide a clear or accurate summary of the article's content.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistency is likely due to a lack of attention to detail or a misunderstanding of the article's content.
