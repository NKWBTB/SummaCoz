It was the 29-year-old Spaniard's first Grand Tour stage win and Movistar's first at this year's Giro - still led by Jungels, with Geraint Thomas second.
Thomas' Team Sky team-mate Mikel Landa's late attack was caught as time gaps in the top 10 stayed the same.
Thomas is six seconds behind Jungels, with fellow Briton Adam Yates third.
Orica-Scott rider Yates is 10 seconds behind Quick-Step's Jungels, on the same time as favourites Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on Saturday.
Landa had built up a lead of 15 seconds on Jungels - a gap that would have seen him climb into the overall lead - before being reeled back by the peloton on the up-and-down finish into Peschici.
Sunday's stage takes the riders into the high mountains for the first time since stage four, with a summit finish on the category-one Blockhaus ending a relatively flat 149km from Montenero di Bisaccia.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "d\\'italia",
  "victory in the giro d\\'italia",
  "britain\\'s"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "d'italia" should be "Giro d'Italia" because "d'italia" is not a correct Italian phrase. "Giro d'Italia" is the correct name of the race in Italian.
2. "victory in the giro d'italia" should be "stage victory in the Giro d'Italia" because the article is discussing a specific stage win, not the overall victory of the race.
3. "britain's" should be removed because the rider, Geraint Thomas, is British, and there is no need to specify his nationality.

Therefore, the summary should read:

"Geraint Thomas took a stage victory in the Giro d'Italia."

The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains errors in Italian phrasing and includes unnecessary information.
