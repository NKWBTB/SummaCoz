    Summary: 
    britain\'s geraint thomas moved into second place in the giro d\'italia with victory in the giro d\'italia. 

    Article: 
    It was the 29-year-old Spaniard's first Grand Tour stage win and Movistar's first at this year's Giro - still led by Jungels, with Geraint Thomas second.
Thomas' Team Sky team-mate Mikel Landa's late attack was caught as time gaps in the top 10 stayed the same.
Thomas is six seconds behind Jungels, with fellow Briton Adam Yates third.
Orica-Scott rider Yates is 10 seconds behind Quick-Step's Jungels, on the same time as favourites Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on Saturday.
Landa had built up a lead of 15 seconds on Jungels - a gap that would have seen him climb into the overall lead - before being reeled back by the peloton on the up-and-down finish into Peschici.
Sunday's stage takes the riders into the high mountains for the first time since stage four, with a summit finish on the category-one Blockhaus ending a relatively flat 149km from Montenero di Bisaccia.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Geraint Thomas moved into second place in the Giro d'Italia, but the article states that he is currently in third place, six seconds behind Bob Jungels.
2. The summary mentions that Thomas' Team Sky team-mate Mikel Landa had a late attack, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that Landa built up a lead of 15 seconds on Jungels, but the article states that Landa was caught by the peloton on the up-and-down finish into Peschici.
4. The summary does not mention that the stage was won by Gorka Izagirre, but the article states that he won the stage.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article, such as Thomas moving into second place and Landa's late attack. Additionally, it omits information that is present in the article, such as the winner of the stage.
