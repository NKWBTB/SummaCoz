    Summary: 
    a man has been charged with the murder of a dallas teenager who was shot dead in the us state of texas. 

    Article: 
    Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15.
His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed "aggressively" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
"It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office," Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.
The teenager was described by his coach as "a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend".
Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.
If convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail.
Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: "We remain cautious. A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it's been [more than] 40 years since a cop was convicted in [Texas]." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the policeman was charged with the murder of a Dallas teenager, but the article states that he was charged with murder and four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

2. The summary does not mention that the officer was fired from his job or that he is currently free on bail.

3. The summary does not provide any information about the circumstances of the shooting, such as the fact that the officer fired into a car full of teenagers as they left a party, or that the car was driving away from the officer and not reversing "aggressively" towards him as initially claimed.

4. The summary does not mention the statement from the district attorney, Faith Johnson, or the fact that the officer faces 5 to 99 years in prison if convicted.

5. The summary does not mention the lawyer for the Edwards family's statement on Twitter.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article, as it omits several important details and misstates some of the information.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the policeman was charged with the murder of a Dallas teenager, but the article never mentions the origin of the teenager victim.

###Comment:
