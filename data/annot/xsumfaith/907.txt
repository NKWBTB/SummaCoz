About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.
But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.
Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.
The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.
Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday.
"Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.
The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.
In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.
Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.
The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.
Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news".
"The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a collection of items worth up to Â£80,000 has been put up for sale at a museum in Staffordshire.
2. However, the article states that the collection faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt, and not that it was put up for sale.
3. The article also states that the collection will remain on display at the museum and will be loaned to the Wedgwood Museum, which contradicts the idea that the collection is being sold.
4. Additionally, the article mentions that the collection includes works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters, and photographs, which is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the information that the collection is not being sold, but rather will remain on display and be loaned to another museum. The summary also omits important details about the collection's contents.
