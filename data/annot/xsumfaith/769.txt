    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a murder investigation has been launched after a man died following a stabbing attack on a house in south Yorkshire.

2. However, the article does not mention anything about a murder investigation. Instead, it reports that Adrian Fatchett, 52, died after being injured in a stabbing attack at a house in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South, and that a 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder.

3. The article does not mention the word "murder" anywhere, only "stabbing attack" and "suspicion of murder" in reference to the 17-year-old boy's arrest.

4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a murder investigation, while the article only reports a stabbing attack and an arrest for suspicion of murder.

5. The summary is likely incorrect or incomplete because it adds additional information that is not present in the article.
