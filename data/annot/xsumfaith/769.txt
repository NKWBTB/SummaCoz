Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Adrian Fatchett died after being injured at a house in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South.
2. The summary states that a murder investigation has been launched after a man died following a stabbing attack on a house in South Yorkshire.
3. The article does not mention a stabbing attack. Instead, it states that Adrian Fatchett died after being injured at a house.
4. Therefore, the phrase "stabbing attack" in the summary is not supported by the article.
5. Additionally, the phrase "following a stabbing attack" in the summary is also not supported by the article, as there is no mention of a stabbing attack in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the phrases "stabbing attack" and "following a stabbing attack" are not accurate based on the information provided in the article.
