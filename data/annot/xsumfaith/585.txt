Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Migaloo is known for his distinctive coloring and has been sighted off the coast of New South Wales state, including the resort town of Byron Bay. However, the summary states that the famous white humpback whale has been spotted on his annual migration to Australia's north. This implies that Migaloo is migrating to a different location, which is not supported by the article.
2. The article does not mention anything about Migaloo migrating to a specific location, let alone Australia's north. Instead, it states that he has been sighted off the coast of New South Wales state.
3. The word "annual" in the summary is also not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about Migaloo migrating on an annual basis.
4. Finally, the word "north" in the summary is also not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about Migaloo traveling to the north.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies listed above, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
