     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Read the summary and the article.

Summary: A famous white humpback whale has been spotted on his annual migration to Australia's north.

Article: Migaloo is known for his distinctive coloring and for many years was the only documented all-white humpback whale in the world. He has been sighted off the coast of New South Wales state, including the resort town of Byron Bay. Migaloo's journey up Australia's east coast has attracted large numbers of whale enthusiasts. The 14m-long mammal was spotted with a companion during his venture north but now appears to be traveling solo.

Step 2: Identify the inconsistencies.

The summary mentions that the whale is on its annual migration to Australia's north, but the article does not mention anything about migration. Instead, the article states that Migaloo has been sighted off the coast of New South Wales state, including the resort town of Byron Bay, and that he is traveling solo after being spotted with a companion during his venture north.

Step 3: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies.

The inconsistency in the summary is likely due to the fact that the author of the summary may have assumed that Migaloo's journey up the east coast of Australia was a migration, when in fact it is simply a seasonal movement to warmer waters for the winter months. Additionally, the summary mentions that the whale is on its annual migration to Australia's north, which is not accurate as Migaloo has been spotted in the same area for several years, and his movements are not necessarily annual.

Step 4: Evaluate the impact of the inconsistencies.

The inconsistencies in the summary may have led to a misrepresentation of the facts and may have created confusion for readers who are not familiar with Migaloo's movements. Additionally, the summary's emphasis on Migaloo's migration may have given readers the impression that he is a more nomadic whale than he actually is.

Overall, the inconsistencies in the summary are likely due to a misunderstanding of Migaloo's movements and the author'
