    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after a pick-up fell from a pick-up truck in lincolnshire. 

    Article: 
    Officers believe the local man, who was working at Fruehauf on Houghton Road, fell from a cherry picker at about 13:45 GMT on Thursday.
Lincolnshire Police said it was carrying out a joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive.
The company was cooperating fully with the investigation, the force added. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
2. However, the article states that the man fell from a cherry picker, not that he was driving dangerously.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that the man was driving dangerously, whereas the article only states that he fell from a cherry picker.
4. The article does mention that the police are conducting an investigation, but it does not mention anything about the man being arrested or charged with a crime.
5. Therefore, the summary is not only inconsistent with the article, but it also includes additional information that is not present in the article (the man's arrest).

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after a pick-up fell from a pick-up truck.
2. However, the article does not mention a man driving dangerously. Instead, the article focuses on a man fell from a cherry picker, not from a pick-up truck.
