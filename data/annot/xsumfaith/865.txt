</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the man fell from a cherry picker, which is a piece of equipment used for lifting and reaching heights.
2. The summary states that the man fell from a first-floor window. This is inconsistent with the article, as there is no mention of a window in the article.
3. The article is specific about the location of the incident, stating that it occurred on Houghton Road in Lincolnshire. The summary does not provide any information about the location of the incident.
4. The article mentions that the police and the Health and Safety Executive are conducting an investigation, which suggests that the incident is being taken seriously and is being thoroughly investigated. The summary does not mention any investigation.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
