    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a man fell from a first-floor window on the Isle of Wight.

However, the article states that the man fell from a cherry picker, not a first-floor window. This is a significant inconsistency.

2. The article states that the fall occurred at about 13:45 GMT on Thursday.

The summary does not mention the time or day of the incident.

3. The article states that Lincolnshire Police is carrying out a joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive.

The summary does not mention anything about an investigation or the involvement of the Health and Safety Executive.

4. The article states that the company, Fruehauf, is cooperating fully with the investigation.

The summary does not mention the company's cooperation or any investigation.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
