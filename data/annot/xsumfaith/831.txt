    Summary: 
    police investigating the disappearance of a man in county antrim have released cctv footage of a man they want to trace. 

    Article: 
    Trevor Deely, 22, was last seen walking home from a Christmas party in December 2000.
A search of a site in Chapelizod in Dublin started early on Saturday morning, Irish national broadcaster, RTÉ reports.
The area is three acres of Woodlands beside the R112 which runs down to the River Liffey.
Gardaí said the search will involve excavations and is expected to take a number of weeks.
Earlier this year a team of six detectives began conducting a complete review of Mr Deely's disappearance.
CCTV footage from the night he went missing was enhanced using specialist technology.
It shows Mr Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street, where he worked.
It is understood he was returning to get an umbrella after the party.
Detectives released the footage in April and appealed for the man to come forward.
They believe he was the same man captured on CCTV following Mr Deely, who was from County Kildare in the Republic of Ireland, a short time later on Haddington Road.
On Saturday gardaí said the man seen in the CCTV has not yet been identified and they renewed their appeal for him to come forward. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that police are releasing CCTV footage of a man they want to trace, but the article does not mention any CCTV footage being released.

2. The summary mentions that the man in the CCTV footage has not yet been identified, but the article states that detectives released the enhanced CCTV footage in April and appealed for the man to come forward.

3. The summary does not mention anything about a search of a site in Chapelizod, Dublin, or any excavations, but the article states that a search of the site started early on Saturday morning and will involve excavations.

4. The summary does not mention anything about a review of Mr. Deely's disappearance being conducted by a team of six detectives, but the article states that a complete review of Mr. Deely's disappearance began earlier this year.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
