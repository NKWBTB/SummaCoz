    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the chief executive of the Isle of Man County Council has been appointed as the new chief executive, but the article does not mention any appointment of a new chief executive.
2. The article mentions that Richard Ellis, the current chief executive, is leaving the council at the end of his contract, and that Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are leaving through a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme. This suggests that there is no new chief executive being appointed.
3. The summary also mentions that the departures are indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the departures are due to the end of contracts and the voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.
4. Finally, the summary mentions that Mr. Ellis is the council's former interim director of corporate governance, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that he is the current chief executive.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
