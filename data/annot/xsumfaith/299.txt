  "the chief executive of the isle of man county council has been appointed as the new chief executive"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Richard Ellis is leaving the council at the end of his contract, while Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are leaving under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.
2. The summary claims that the chief executive of the Isle of Man County Council has been appointed as the new chief executive.
3. The article does not mention any appointment of a new chief executive. Instead, it mentions that Angela Scott, the current chief executive, thanked the departing staff members for their dedication and professionalism.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it claims that a new chief executive has been appointed when the article does not mention any such appointment.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
