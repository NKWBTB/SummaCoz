Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Richard Ellis is leaving the council at the end of his contract on Friday. This is not consistent with the summary, which states that the chief executive of the Isle of Man County Council has been appointed as the new chief executive.
2. The article also mentions that Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are leaving the council under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme. This is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The article quotes Stephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, as saying that the departures are indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff. This is not mentioned in the summary.
4. The article mentions that Angela Scott, the council chief executive, thanked the trio for their "dedication and professionalism". This is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary only mentions the departure of one person, the chief executive, while the article mentions the departures of three people and provides additional information about their roles and the reasons for their departures. Additionally, the summary does not include any of the additional information provided in the article, such as the voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme, the leader of the opposition's comments, and the council chief executive's thank you message.
