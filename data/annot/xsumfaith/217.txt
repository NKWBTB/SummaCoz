South Wimbledon and Queensway stations will be the first to see their staff moved from ticket offices into ticket halls and on to platforms.
Transport for London (TfL) said it would save £50m annually as it tries to save £4.2bn by 2020.
But Manuel Cortes, from the TSSA union, said London Mayor Boris Johnson was "rushing through" the closures.
Mr Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association said: "Talks on the safety implications of closing over 250 stations have not even been concluded.
"The mayor doesn't seem concerned about how millions of tourists will cope with fewer staff to help them on their way."
TfL said all stations would remain staffed and 150 new ticket machines would be installed by April 2016.
It added that new visitor centres would be created at larger stations such as Victoria and King's Cross to help visitors.
Nick Brown, London Underground's chief operating officer, said more staff were being placed "where they can offer the best possible assistance" as only 3% of Tube tickets were bought at ticket offices.
He said: "This forms part of our wider vision for the Tube, which includes a 24-hour weekend service on core parts of the network."
But the changes have led to previous strikes by the Aslef and RMT unions.
Labour's London Assembly transport spokeswoman Val Shawcross said: "When he was elected, Boris Johnson promised Londoners he would protect the capital's ticket offices, but today he starts the process of dismantling each and every one of them.
"Whilst there is obviously a big role for ticket machines to play, there is no substitute for a member of staff."
London Underground said after 100 meetings with unions the number of roles to be reduced had fallen from 950 to 897 with no member of staff facing compulsory redundancy or losing money.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "two london underground stations are to close as part of a shake-up of ticket office operations",
  "close"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "South Wimbledon and Queensway stations will be the first to see their staff moved from ticket offices into ticket halls and on to platforms." This means that the stations will not be closing, but rather the staff will be relocated.
2. The summary states that "two London Underground stations are to close as part of a shake-up of ticket office operations." This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention any stations closing.
3. The article does mention that the number of ticket offices will be reduced, but it does not say that any stations will be closing. In fact, the article states that all stations will remain staffed.
4. The summary's statement that "two London Underground stations are to close" is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the consistency issue is that the summary states that two stations will close, while the article does not mention any stations closing.
