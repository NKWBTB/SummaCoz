<Article>
The shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School in Bangalore city.
Police say the alleged gunman, identified as Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school.
Incidents of gun crime at schools and colleges in India are very rare. It is not clear what prompted the shooting.
Police said on Thursday that Mahesh had been remanded until 12 April.
Mahesh is alleged to have barged into the room of 18-year-old Gautami and shot her in the head with a pistol on on Tuesday evening.
He then shot another student, Sirisha, who suffered severe injuries but is believed to be out of danger, say police.
He was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt.
India has strict control laws, although a large number of feuds are settled with firearms.
In 2007, a 14-year-old schoolboy was shot dead by two fellow students at a school campus near the capital, Delhi.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "gun attack",
  "man",
  "man has been shot",
  "capital, delhi"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "gun attack": The article does not mention a "gun attack". Instead, it states that the alleged gunman, Mahesh, barged into a room and shot two students.
2. "man": The article does not mention the gender of the alleged gunman or the victims. Therefore, the phrase "man" is not accurate.
3. "man has been shot": The article states that two students were shot, not one man.
4. "capital, delhi": The article does not mention the location of the shooting as Delhi. The correct location is Bangalore.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
