<Article>
The advocacy group Glaad analysed shows seen or to be shown between June 2016 and May 2017 and counted 278 regular and recurring LGBT characters.
The number of transgender characters has risen from seven to 16 this year.
But Glaad bemoaned the fact that more than 25 lesbian and bisexual female characters died or were killed off.
They include the characters Poussey Washington and Bea Smith, who met violent ends in Orange is the New Black and Wentworth respectively.
The report also found a record high percentage of black characters on broadcast television, thanks mostly to shows like Empire, Luke Cage and How to Get Away with Murder.
Glaad's Where We Are on TV study based its findings on scripted broadcast, cable and streaming series already being shown or for which casting had been confirmed.
Glaad's president Sarah Kate Ellis said it was "heartening to see progress being made" but said numbers were "only part of the story".

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "more than 25 lesbian and bisexual female characters died or were killed off" in the past year, which contradicts the summary's claim that the number of lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters is at its highest level since records began.
2. The article also mentions that there was an increase in the number of transgender characters, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article emphasizes that while there is progress, the number of lesbian and bisexual female characters dying or being killed off is a cause for concern. The summary does not acknowledge this concern.
4. The article is based on a study by Glaad, which analyzed scripted broadcast, cable, and streaming series already shown or for which casting had been confirmed. The summary does not provide any information about the methodology of the study.
5. Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It presents a more positive picture of the state of LGBT representation on TV, which is not supported by the article's findings.
