    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the number of lesbian, bisexual and transgender characters in tv and tv is at its highest level since records began, according to a new study. 

    Article: 
    The advocacy group Glaad analysed shows seen or to be shown between June 2016 and May 2017 and counted 278 regular and recurring LGBT characters.
The number of transgender characters has risen from seven to 16 this year.
But Glaad bemoaned the fact that more than 25 lesbian and bisexual female characters died or were killed off.
They include the characters Poussey Washington and Bea Smith, who met violent ends in Orange is the New Black and Wentworth respectively.
The report also found a record high percentage of black characters on broadcast television, thanks mostly to shows like Empire, Luke Cage and How to Get Away with Murder.
Glaad's Where We Are on TV study based its findings on scripted broadcast, cable and streaming series already being shown or for which casting had been confirmed.
Glaad's president Sarah Kate Ellis said it was "heartening to see progress being made" but said numbers were "only part of the story".

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the number of lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters in TV is at its highest level since records began, but the article does not mention any specific record or historical high. Instead, it reports on the findings of Glaad's Where We Are on TV study, which found a record high percentage of black characters on broadcast television.
2. The summary mentions that more than 25 lesbian and bisexual female characters died or were killed off, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it notes that the number of transgender characters has risen from seven to 16 this year.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the study only looked at scripted broadcast, cable, and streaming series already being shown or for which casting had been confirmed. This is an important detail that is included in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the scope of the study and misrepresents some of the findings.
