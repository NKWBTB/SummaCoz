<Article>
The advocacy group Glaad analysed shows seen or to be shown between June 2016 and May 2017 and counted 278 regular and recurring LGBT characters.
The number of transgender characters has risen from seven to 16 this year.
But Glaad bemoaned the fact that more than 25 lesbian and bisexual female characters died or were killed off.
They include the characters Poussey Washington and Bea Smith, who met violent ends in Orange is the New Black and Wentworth respectively.
The report also found a record high percentage of black characters on broadcast television, thanks mostly to shows like Empire, Luke Cage and How to Get Away with Murder.
Glaad's Where We Are on TV study based its findings on scripted broadcast, cable and streaming series already being shown or for which casting had been confirmed.
Glaad's president Sarah Kate Ellis said it was "heartening to see progress being made" but said numbers were "only part of the story".

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "in tv and tv is at its highest level since records began",
  "highest level since records began, according to a new study"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the number of LGBT characters on broadcast, cable, and streaming series has increased, with a record high percentage of black characters.
2. The summary states that the number of lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters in TV is at its highest level since records began.
3. The problem is that the word "TV" is repeated in the summary, which is not present in the article. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not accurately reflect the content of the article.
4. Additionally, the phrase "since records began" is also not present in the article. The article only mentions that the number of LGBT characters has increased, without specifying when this increase began.
5. Finally, the summary states that the increase in LGBT characters is according to a new study, but the article does not mention any specific study or research.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it appears that the summary may not accurately reflect the content of the article.
