</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "70th anniversary",
  "70th anniversary of vj day"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the service was held to mark the surrender of Japan at the end of World War Two, but the summary only mentions the 70th anniversary of VJ Day. This is inconsistent because the article does not mention VJ Day specifically, only the surrender of Japan.
2. The summary mentions "70th anniversary" twice, but the article does not mention the number 70 at all. This is inconsistent because the article does not provide any information about the passage of time since the event took place.
3. The summary mentions "vj day" in the second sentence, but the article does not use this term. Instead, the article uses the phrase "the surrender of Japan." This is inconsistent because the summary is using a different term to describe the same event.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and it uses different terminology to describe the same event.
