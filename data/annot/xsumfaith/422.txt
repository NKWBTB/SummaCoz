    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a memorial service was held in Portsmouth to mark the 70th anniversary of VJ Day.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the 70th anniversary of VJ Day. Instead, it mentions that the service was held to mark the surrender of Japan at the end of World War Two.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions an anniversary that is not mentioned in the article.
4. Additionally, the summary mentions a memorial service, but the article only mentions a service led by Reverend Canon Bob White, with readings from Burma veterans and a performance from the Portsmouth Military Wives Choir. There is no mention of a memorial service in the article.
5. Finally, the summary mentions wreaths being laid at the war memorial, but the article does not mention this either.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions events and details that are not present in the article.
