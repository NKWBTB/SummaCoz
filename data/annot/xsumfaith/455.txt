It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation.
Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials.
"This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin.
"From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria.
"In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport.
Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations.
But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
"I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin.
"We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly.
"One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

  "(ifa) has said it will not accept a bid to host the 2018 world cup in 2021",
  "not accept a bid to host the 2018 world cup in 2021"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015.
2. The article also states that Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid because the island is not recognized by the United Nations as an independent nation.
3. The summary states that the Jersey Football Association (ifa) has said it will not accept a bid to host the 2018 World Cup in 2021.
4. The problem with this statement is that it is not supported by the article. Nowhere in the article does it mention the ifa or the 2018 World Cup. The article only mentions Jersey's bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa, and Uefa's decision not to allow their congress to discuss the bid.
5. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not consistent with the article and should not have been included.

I hope that helps clarify the issue! Let me know if you have any further questions.
