    Summary: 
    the jersey football association (ifa) has said it will not accept a bid to host the 2018 world cup in 2021. 

    Article: 
    Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation.
Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials.
"This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin.
"From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria.
"In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport.
Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations.
But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
"I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin.
"We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly.
"One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Jersey Football Association (JFA) will not accept a bid to host the 2018 World Cup in 2021. However, the article does not mention anything about the JFA submitting a bid to host the World Cup.
2. The article states that Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid because the island is not recognized by the United Nations as an independent nation. This means that the JFA's bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa has been rejected.
3. The summary mentions that the JFA president, Phil Austin, said that the executive of Uefa do not have the authority to reject their application, and that it should go to congress. However, the article does not mention Austin making this statement.
4. The article states that Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, but the bid was rejected due to the island's status as a crown dependency of Great Britain. The article does not mention anything about the JFA submitting a bid to host the World Cup.
5. Therefore, based on the information in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a bid to host the World Cup, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary quotes the JFA president as saying that the executive of Uefa do not have the authority to reject their application, which is also not mentioned in the article.
