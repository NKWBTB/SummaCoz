<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    three teenagers have been rescued after their boat capsized off the dumfries and galloway coast. 

    Article: 
    The boat is understood to have capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service initially said one of the three - believed to be teenagers - made it ashore, and efforts were being made to reach the other two who were stranded on an island in the river.
They were later rescued by boat.
The alert was raised shortly after 13:45. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the boat capsized off the Dumfries and Galloway coast.

However, the article states that the boat capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug. This is not part of the Dumfries and Galloway coast.

2. The summary mentions that three teenagers were rescued, but the article only mentions two teenagers being rescued.

The article states that one of the three teenagers made it ashore and efforts were being made to reach the other two who were stranded on an island in the river. This implies that only two teenagers were rescued, not three.

3. The summary does not mention the island where the two teenagers were stranded.

The article mentions that the two teenagers were stranded on an island in the river, but this information is not included in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the location of the capsized boat or the number of teenagers rescued.
