</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the boat capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug.
2. The summary states that the boat capsized off the Dumfries and Galloway coast.
3. These two locations are not the same. Durris is a location within Scotland, while Dumfries and Galloway is a region in southwest Scotland.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it places the capsized boat in a different location than where the article states it occurred.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it provides incorrect information about the location of the capsized boat.

###Corrected:
1. The article states that the boat capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug.
2. The summary states that the boat capsized off the Dumfries and Galloway coast.
3. These two locations are not the same.
