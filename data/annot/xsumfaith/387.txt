    Summary: 
    first minister carwyn jones has revealed the birth of her mother, who has been missing for three weeks. 

    Article: 
    The 39-year-old, from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, revealed the news live on BBC One's The One Show on Thursday evening but has yet to reveal the name.
It is Miss Jones' first child with partner Charlie Thomson and he was born in the morning of Sunday, 22 January, weighing 7lbs 11.
Ms Jones was concerned she had left it too late to have a baby after filming a documentary, Fertility and Me. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "first minister Carwyn Jones has revealed the birth of her mother." This is incorrect, as Carwyn Jones is a male and cannot have given birth to a child.
2. The article states that the baby was born to Miss Jones and her partner Charlie Thomson. This means that Carwyn Jones, the first minister, is not the mother of the baby.
3. The summary also states that the birth took place three weeks ago, but the article states that the baby was born on Sunday, January 22nd, which is a recent event and not three weeks ago.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reasons for this inconsistency are:

* Carwyn Jones is a male and cannot give birth to a child.
* The baby was born to Miss Jones and her partner, not Carwyn Jones.
* The birth took place recently, not three weeks ago.
