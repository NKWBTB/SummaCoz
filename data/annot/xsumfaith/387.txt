<Summary>

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The first sentence of the summary states "first minister carwyn jones has revealed the birth of her mother." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Carwyn Jones being the first minister or her mother giving birth.
2. The article only mentions a woman named Ms. Jones, who is the subject of the article and has given birth to a baby boy. There is no mention of Carwyn Jones or her mother.
3. The summary is not supported by any information in the article, and is therefore not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains false information and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
