Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The article states that Jack Dale was released by Carlisle United at the end of the 2015-16 campaign, which implies that he is no longer playing for Rochdale.
2. The summary states that Rochdale have re-signed Jack Dale on loan until the end of the season, which suggests that he is currently playing for Rochdale.
3. The article does not mention anything about Jack Dale being loaned back to Rochdale. Instead, it mentions that he joined Tranmere Rovers in 2012 and was released by Carlisle United at the end of the 2015-16 campaign.
4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is not possible for Jack Dale to be on loan to Rochdale until the end of the season, as he is no longer playing for the club.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Jack Dale is currently playing for Rochdale, while the article states that he was released by Carlisle United and is no longer playing for Rochdale.
