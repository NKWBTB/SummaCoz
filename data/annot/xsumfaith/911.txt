Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jack Dale was released by Carlisle United at the end of the 2015-16 campaign. This means that he is no longer playing for Tranmere Rovers, as the article mentions that he joined Tranmere in 2012 and returned for a loan spell in 2013.
2. The summary states that Rochdale have re-signed Jack Dale on loan until the end of the season. This implies that Jack Dale is currently playing for Rochdale, which contradicts the article's statement that he was released by Carlisle United.
3. The article does not mention anything about Jack Dale joining Rochdale or being loaned to Rochdale. The only mention of Rochdale in the article is in the final sentence, which is a separate sentence that mentions the latest football transfers.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Jack Dale has been re-signed by Rochdale on loan until the end of the season is not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary contains inconsistent information because it implies that Jack Dale is currently playing for Rochdale, which is not supported by the article.
