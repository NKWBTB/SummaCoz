    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Rochdale has re-signed Jack Dale on loan until the end of the season.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Rochdale re-signing Jack Dale. Instead, it mentions that Jack Dale played for Tranmere Rovers and was released by Carlisle United.
3. The article does mention that Rochdale began the 2016-17 season with a 3-2 home defeat by Peterborough on Saturday, but it does not mention anything about signing Jack Dale.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a loan signing of Jack Dale by Rochdale, which is not supported by the information in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains incorrect information about Jack Dale's current club and the fact that Rochdale has not re-signed him.
