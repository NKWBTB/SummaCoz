What is behind the South East Asia haze?
In a joint statement, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have "not procured or used wood, paper and/or pulp materials" from firms accused of contributing to the fires.
The SEC said retailers were "a good starting point" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and "for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices"
The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region. It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month, in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Anger has been rising in the region, with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The summary claims that all supermarkets in Singapore have been canceled due to the haze, while the article states that only seven firms, including major supermarkets, have been asked to declare that they are not sourcing materials from companies suspected of contributing to the haze. The summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the scope of the impact of the haze on supermarkets.

    2. The summary mentions that all supermarkets have been canceled, while the article only mentions that seven firms, including major supermarkets, have been asked to declare their sourcing practices. The summary is not accurate because it implies that all supermarkets have been affected, when in fact only some of them have been asked to take action.

    3. The summary does not provide any information about the reason for the cancellation of the supermarkets, while the article explains that the cancellation is due to the haze caused by the forest fires in Indonesia. The summary does not provide context or explanation for the cancellation, which is not consistent with the article.

    4. The summary uses the phrase "state-run paper paper," which is not a correct phrase. The article does not mention anything about a state-run paper company, and it is likely that the summary is a typo or a misunderstanding. The inconsistency in the phrase suggests that the summary may not be reliable.

    5. The summary does not mention anything about the impact of the haze on the environment or public health, while the article highlights the hazardous air quality and the cancellation of public events due to the haze. The summary does not provide a complete picture of the situation, which is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the scope of the impact of the haze, does not provide context or explanation for the cancellation of supermarkets, and does not mention the environmental and public health impacts of the haze.
