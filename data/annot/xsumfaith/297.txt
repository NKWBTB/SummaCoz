<Article>
The turkey firm was sold to the food tycoon Ranjit Boparan on Tuesday.
There had been fears that the new owners would not take on the existing workers' pension scheme.
But Unite regional officer Steve Harley said: "We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured."
Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover.
The Boparan Private Office, the "chicken king" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.
Mr Harley met with representatives from Boparan at the Great Witchingham headquarters.
He said: "It was made clear that the new owner wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business.
"This would be achieved by greater investment in the business, cost savings and utilising the present spare capacity at Bernard Matthews to process chicken and not just turkeys."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the new owners of Bernard Matthews, Ranjit Boparan, have given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured, including the pension scheme.
2. The summary states that the new owners are "dismayed" that a new pension scheme will be held in the UK.
3. The word "dismayed" implies a negative emotion, which is inconsistent with the article's statement that the new owners have given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured.
4. Furthermore, the article does not mention anything about a new pension scheme being held in the UK.
5. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies a negative emotion and a new pension scheme that is not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the inconsistency lies in the summary's use of the word "dismayed" and the mention of a new pension scheme, neither of which are supported by the article.
