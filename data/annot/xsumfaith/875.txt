</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that James Browning is a former England Under-21 international who has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for Everton.
2. The summary states that James Browning has been signed by League One side Oldham Athletic on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. James Browning is currently a player for Everton, not Chelsea, and he has not been loaned to Oldham Athletic.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that James Browning is a Chelsea player and has been loaned to Oldham Athletic, when in fact he is an Everton player.

###Corrected:
1. The article states that James Browning is a former England Under-21 international who has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for Everton.
2. The summary states that James Browning has been signed by League One side Oldham Athletic on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. James Browning is currently a player for Everton, not Chelsea, and he has not been loaned to Oldham Athletic.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
