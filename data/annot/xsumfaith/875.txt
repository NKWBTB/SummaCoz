     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Oldham Athletic signed James Browning on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season, but the article does not mention anything about Oldham Athletic or a loan deal.
2. The article states that Browning is a former Everton player, not Oldham Athletic.
3. The summary mentions that Browning has signed with Oldham Athletic until the end of the season, but the article does not mention the duration of his injury or his return to football.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
