<Article>
The Reds, who are fifth in National Two South, beat third-placed Chinnor 29-12 for a second win in a row.
"Tommy Phillips, Ben Priddey and Craig Williams really led the team from the front," Churcher told BBC Cornwall.
"If your front row and front five are making 70-plus tackles in a game you're going to be doing well and that's what happened against Chinnor."
The Reds face seven teams who are below them in the table in their next eight games, as well as league leaders Old Elthamians.
Churcher believes his side still has a lot of room for improvement, adding: "Chinnor wasn't the complete performance, but emotionally it was a really dogged performance.
"We've got to build on what we did last weekend, because if we don't, last weekend will have been a waste of time."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Redruth's head coach, Marek Churcher, believes his side is capable of reaching the top of the table with a 2-0 win at home to Plymouth.
2. However, the article states that Redruth is currently fifth in National Two South and faces seven teams who are below them in the table in their next eight games, including league leaders Old Elthamians.
3. Based on this information, it is unlikely that Redruth will be able to achieve a 2-0 win at home to Plymouth, as they are currently in a lower position in the table and have a tough schedule ahead.
4. Furthermore, the article quotes Churcher as saying that the team still has a lot of room for improvement and that their recent win against Chinnor was not a complete performance.
5. Therefore, it can be inferred that Churcher does not believe his side is currently capable of reaching the top of the table, and the summary is not consistent with the article.
