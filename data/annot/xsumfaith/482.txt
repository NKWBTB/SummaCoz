    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    redruth head coach marek churcher says his side are capable of reaching the top of the table with a 2-0 win at home to plymouth. 

    Article: 
    The Reds, who are fifth in National Two South, beat third-placed Chinnor 29-12 for a second win in a row.
"Tommy Phillips, Ben Priddey and Craig Williams really led the team from the front," Churcher told BBC Cornwall.
"If your front row and front five are making 70-plus tackles in a game you're going to be doing well and that's what happened against Chinnor."
The Reds face seven teams who are below them in the table in their next eight games, as well as league leaders Old Elthamians.
Churcher believes his side still has a lot of room for improvement, adding: "Chinnor wasn't the complete performance, but emotionally it was a really dogged performance.
"We've got to build on what we did last weekend, because if we don't, last weekend will have been a waste of time." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Redruth's coach Marek Churcher believes his team can reach the top of the table with a 2-0 win at home to Plymouth. However, the article does not mention anything about Plymouth or the team's ability to reach the top of the table.
2. The article only mentions Redruth's victory over Chinnor and their upcoming games against teams below them in the table, with no mention of Plymouth or any ambition to reach the top of the table.
3. The coach's quote in the article does not support the idea that the team can reach the top of the table with a 2-0 win, as he emphasizes the need for improvement and notes that the team's performance against Chinnor was not complete.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it presents a claim that is not supported by the information in the article.
