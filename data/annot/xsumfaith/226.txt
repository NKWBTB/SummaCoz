Jonathan Rees QC said the alleged failure of Ms Rose, of Newham, east London, to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test, and refer him on for further investigation, was "at the heart of the prosecution case".
A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death, the court heard.
"The prosecution allege that Vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant, Ms Rose, done her job properly," he told the jury.
"Given the risk of death involved, her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent optometrist - that it was criminal."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the optometrist is accused of manslaughter and that the death of a 10-year-old boy contributed to her being accused of manslaughter.
2. However, the article states that the optometrist, Honey Rose, is accused of gross negligence manslaughter, not simple manslaughter.
3. The article also states that Vinnie Barker, the 10-year-old boy, died five months after a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich, and that the prosecution alleges that Ms. Rose failed to detect swollen optic discs during the test and did not refer him for further investigation.
4. The article does not mention anything about the death of the boy contributing to Ms. Rose being accused of manslaughter. Instead, the prosecution's case is based on the allegation that Ms. Rose's failure to detect the swollen optic discs was so far below the expected standard that it was "criminal".
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misstates the nature of the accusations against Ms. Rose and the cause of Vinnie's death.
