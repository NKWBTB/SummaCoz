    Article: 
    Vincent Barker, known as Vinnie, died in July 2012, five months after he had a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich.
The prosecution told Ipswich Crown Court the conduct of eye specialist Honey Rose, 35, was so far below the expected standard it was "criminal".
Ms Rose denies a charge of gross negligence manslaughter.

Jonathan Rees QC said the alleged failure of Ms Rose, of Newham, east London, to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test, and refer him on for further investigation, was "at the heart of the prosecution case".
A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death, the court heard.
"The prosecution allege that Vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant, Ms Rose, done her job properly," he told the jury.
"Given the risk of death involved, her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent optometrist - that it was criminal."
The trial continues. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the optometrist is accused of manslaughter, but the article does not mention any charges of manslaughter. Instead, the article states that the prosecution alleges that the optometrist's conduct was so far below the expected standard that it was "criminal". This suggests that the optometrist may be charged with gross negligence manslaughter, but this is not explicitly stated in the summary.
2. The summary states that the optometrist contributed to the death of a 10-year-old boy, but the article does not say that the optometrist caused the boy's death. Instead, the article states that the prosecution alleges that the optometrist failed to detect swollen optic discs during a routine test and did not refer the boy for further investigation, which may have contributed to his death.
3. The summary does not mention that the optometrist denied the charge of gross negligence manslaughter, as stated in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the charges against the optometrist, the allegations made by the prosecution, or the optometrist's denial of those allegations.
