Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Liam Mooney joined Alfreton Town on a two-year deal in May, but has only made five appearances.
2. The summary states that Alfreton Town signed Liam Mooney on loan until the end of the season.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. If Mooney joined Alfreton Town on a two-year deal in May, then he would not be on loan until the end of the season.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary is incorrect in stating that Mooney was signed on loan. According to the article, he was signed on a two-year deal.
