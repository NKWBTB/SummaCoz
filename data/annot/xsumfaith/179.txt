    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alfreton Town has signed Liam Mooney on loan until the end of the season.
2. However, the article states that Mooney has only made five appearances for York City, his current club, and has not been a regular player.
3. Therefore, it is unlikely that Mooney would be loaned out to another club, especially to a lower league team like Alfreton Town, if he has not been a regular player for his current club.
4. Additionally, the article mentions that Mooney joined York City from Tranmere Rovers on a two-year deal, which suggests that he is a key player for York City and would not be loaned out to another club without their permission.
5. Finally, the article states that Mooney is available for Alfreton's game against Welling United on Saturday, which is not consistent with the fact that he has only made five appearances for York City and would not be eligible to play for another club without proper clearance.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and should be corrected or revised to accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
