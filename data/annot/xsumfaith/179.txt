For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "league two side alfreton town have signed york city defender liam mooney on loan until the end of the season"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Liam Mooney joined Alfreton Town on loan until the end of the season.
2. However, the summary claims that Alfreton Town has signed Liam Mooney on loan until the end of the season.
3. The word "signed" implies a permanent transfer, whereas the article clearly states that Mooney joined Alfreton Town on loan.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it uses the wrong verb tense to describe Mooney's move to Alfreton Town.

So, the inconsistency in the summary is due to the use of the word "signed" instead of "joined" or "loaned" to describe Mooney's move to Alfreton Town.
