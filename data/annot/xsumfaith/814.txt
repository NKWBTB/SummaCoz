</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Wanda Campbell was jailed for three years, not 12 months.
2. The article also states that she was ordered to pay compensation of £110,000, but the summary does not mention anything about compensation.
3. The article states that Campbell's appeal against the sentence and conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh, but the summary does not mention anything about an appeal.
4. The summary states that Campbell was jailed for 16 years, but the article only mentions a three-year jail sentence.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the length of Campbell's jail sentence and the fact that she was ordered to pay compensation. Additionally, the summary does not mention the appeal that will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh, which is a significant detail that is included in the article.
