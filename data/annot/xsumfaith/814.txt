</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "galloway",
  "12 months for a total of 16 years"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Wanda Campbell was jailed for three years, not 12 months. The summary states that she was jailed for 12 months, which is inconsistent with the article.
2. The article does not mention anything about Galloway. The summary states that the court is located in Dumfries and Galloway, but this is not supported by the article.
3. The article states that Campbell was ordered to pay compensation of £110,000, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
