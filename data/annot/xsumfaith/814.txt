    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a woman has been jailed for 12 months for a total of 16 years for money from a court in dumfries and galloway. 

    Article: 
    Wanda Campbell, 43, of Auchenmalg near Newton Stewart, was jailed for three years earlier this month.
She was also ordered to pay compensation of £110,000 at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
Her appeal against that sentence and the conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh.
She was found guilty after a seven-day trial of acting with others to take the money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman was jailed for 12 months for a total of 16 years. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that she was jailed for three years, not 12 months.
2. The summary also states that the woman was ordered to pay compensation of £110,000, which is not mentioned in the article.
3. The article states that the woman's appeal against her sentence and conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh, which is not mentioned in the summary.
4. The summary states that the woman was found guilty after a seven-day trial, which is consistent with the article. However, the article does not mention the length of the trial.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
