Find out why.

<Article>
Wellington monument on the Blackdown Hills, in Somerset, was built in 1817 but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris.
The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding.
Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was "crucial".
Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo.
But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been "expensive and unsustainable".
Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to "understand this unique and somewhat complex monument".
"We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected," he said.
"The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk."
Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a "more effective repair approach".

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "150th anniversary",
  "first time"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Wellington monument was built in 1817, which is before the Battle of Waterloo (1815). Therefore, it cannot be marking the 150th anniversary of the battle, as the battle took place before the monument was built.
2. The article also states that the monument has been fenced off since 2005 due to falling stone debris, and that the National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar to understand the monument's structure and materials. There is no mention of any work being carried out to mark the 150th anniversary of the battle.
3. The phrase "first time" is also inconsistent with the article, as there is no mention of any previous attempts to repair or maintain the monument.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains two inaccuracies (the 150th anniversary and the first time work is being carried out) that are not supported by the information in the article.
