    Summary: 
    two men have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a robbery at a post office in glasgow. 

    Article: 
    The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday.
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the two men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, but the article does not mention attempted murder. Instead, it states that the men threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money, which suggests that the crime was a robbery rather than an attempted murder.
2. The summary also states that the men escaped with the cash, but the article does not mention anything about the men escaping or getting away with any money. Instead, it states that the men threatened the staff member with a knife and demanded money before the police were called.
3. The summary describes one of the suspects as being "about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper," but the article does not provide any information about the suspects' physical appearance.
4. Finally, the summary mentions that the police are carrying out door-to-door inquiries and collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area, but the article does not mention any of these details.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and may contain inaccuracies or misinformation.
