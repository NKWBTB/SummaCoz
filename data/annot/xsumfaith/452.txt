<Article>
The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday.
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "glasgow",
  "arrested on suspicion of attempted murder"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the robbery took place in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area of Glasgow.
2. The summary states that the robbery took place in Glasgow.

Consistency issue: The summary does not provide the specific location of the robbery, which is mentioned in the article as Quarrywood Avenue, Barmulloch area of Glasgow.

1. The article states that the suspects were not arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Instead, they were arrested on suspicion of robbery.
2. The summary states that the two men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

Consistency issue: The summary incorrectly states that the suspects were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, whereas the article states that they were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

Therefore, the two consistency issues in the summary are:

1. Failure to provide the specific location of the robbery (Glasgow is a broad location, but Quarrywood Avenue and Barmulloch area are more specific).
2. Incorrectly stating that the suspects were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, whereas the article states that they were arrested on suspicion of robbery.
