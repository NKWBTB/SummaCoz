    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Read the summary and identify the main points.

The summary states that the poverty rate in the United States has fallen to its lowest level since 2011.

Step 2: Read the article and identify the main points.

The article states that the poverty rate was 15% in 2011, which means 46.2 million Americans were in poverty, and that there was no change in the poverty rate from the previous three years. The article also states that the real median income of households in the country dropped by 1.5%, and that income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011.

Step 3: Compare the main points of the summary to the main points of the article.

The summary states that the poverty rate has fallen to its lowest level since 2011, but the article states that the poverty rate was flat in 2011 and did not change from the previous three years. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Step 4: Identify the reason for the inconsistency.

The reason for the inconsistency is that the summary states that the poverty rate has fallen, but the article states that the poverty rate was flat. This is because the summary is referring to a different time period than the article. The article is specifically referring to the poverty rate in 2011, while the summary is referring to a more recent time period (without specifying when).

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to a different time period and makes a claim (that the poverty rate has fallen) that is not supported by the article.
