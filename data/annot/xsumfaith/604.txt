  "everton defender tyias browning has signed a new two-and-a-half-year deal and joined championship side preston on loan for the rest of the season"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Browning has progressed through the youth system at Everton and made nine appearances for the club. This suggests that Browning is an Everton player and has not signed a new two-and-a-half-year deal with any other club.
2. The summary states that Browning has signed a new two-and-a-half-year deal and joined Championship side Preston on loan for the rest of the season. This contradicts the article, which states that Browning is an Everton player and has not signed a new deal with any other club.
3. The article does not mention anything about Browning joining Preston on loan. In fact, the article only mentions that Browning missed the end of last season with a knee injury and is now recovering.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Browning has joined Preston on loan for the rest of the season is not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the text. Specifically, the statement about Browning signing a new two-and-a-half-year deal and joining Preston on loan is not present in the article.
