</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Browning has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for Everton. This implies that Browning is an Everton player.
2. The summary states that Browning has signed a new two-and-a-half-year deal and joined Championship side Preston on loan for the rest of the season. This implies that Browning is leaving Everton to join Preston on loan.
3. The article does not mention anything about Browning leaving Everton or joining Preston on loan. In fact, the article only mentions that Browning is hoping to make an impact at Everton.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Browning has left Everton to join Preston on loan, while the article does not mention anything about Browning leaving Everton.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary states that Browning has left Everton to join Preston on loan, which is not supported by the article.
