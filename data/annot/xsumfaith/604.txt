     Sure, I can help you identify the reasons why the given summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my step-by-step explanation:

1. The summary states that Tyias Browning has signed a new two-and-a-half-year deal and joined Championship side Preston on loan for the rest of the season. However, the article does not mention anything about Browning signing a new deal or joining Preston on loan.
2. The article only mentions that Browning has progressed through the youth system at Goodison Park and made nine appearances for the Toffees. There is no mention of him joining any other club, let alone Preston.
3. The summary also mentions that Browning has missed the end of last season with a knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year. However, this information is not present in the article.
4. Finally, the summary ends with a statement about finding all the latest football transfers on a dedicated page, which is not related to the content of the article.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the given summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
