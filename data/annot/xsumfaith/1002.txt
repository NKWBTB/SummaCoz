    Summary: 
    ukip\'s nigel farage has said she will stand down as leader of the party\'s uk independence party. 

    Article: 
    Ms Evans, who is currently suspended from UKIP, said she would "very much like" to run but a "handful of people at the top" had ensured she could not.
Ms Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand.
She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage.
Ms Evans said UKIP needed to "break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground" and also conduct some "internal reform".
The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his "political ambition has been achieved".
In a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said: "I'd very much like to run in that election.
"Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't."
She claimed the party rulebook had been "abused" to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest.
Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority.
Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision.
In the statement, she said: "I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP."
Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that "allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this", but she said the support from members had made her "more determined ever not to give up on UKIP".
She also said that with the right leader, the "sky was the limit for the party".
Endorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was "the best chance" UKIP had to "change, to grow and to thrive".
She said UKIP needed "a clean break from the past" to become more like a political party than "just a rugby club on tour".
Under Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be "more united and consensual".
Prior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto. She was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed Mr Farage's "unresignation" after the general election.
Mr Farage has denied her ban was due to criticism of him. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Nigel Farage will stand down as leader of UKIP, but the article states that Mr. Farage has already stood down as leader and that the leadership contest has been prompted by his decision to leave.

2. The summary mentions that Ms. Evans will stand down as leader of UKIP, but the article states that she is currently suspended from the party and cannot stand due to her six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute.

3. The summary states that Ms. Evans will back Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage, but the article does not mention any endorsement from Ms. Evans for Ms. Duffy.

4. The summary mentions that Ms. Evans has been "axed" from her policy role in the party, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, Ms. Evans is not standing down as leader of UKIP, she is suspended, and the article does not mention her endorsing Lisa Duffy. Additionally, the summary states that Nigel Farage will stand down, but the article states that he has already stood down.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Nigel Farage will stand down as leader of UKIP, but the article states that Mr. Farage has already stood down as leader and that the leadership contest has been prompted by his decision to leave.
2. The summary uses "she" as pronoun for Nigel Farage, but the article states "Mr. Farage". Thus, "he" is the correct pronoun.
