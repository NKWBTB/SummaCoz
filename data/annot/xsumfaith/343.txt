    Summary: 
    a powerful earthquake has struck italy\'s southern central italy, killing at least two people, officials say. 

    Article: 
    The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said.
The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.
Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.
Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.
Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage.
In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.
In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.
Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.
Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor "came out of nowhere", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - "medium-strong" and "fairly shallow".
Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.
Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.
The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided "inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.
At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.
On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that the earthquake killed at least two people, while the article does not mention any fatalities.

Step 2: The summary mentions that the earthquake struck Italy's southern central region, while the article specifically states that the epicentre was in Garfagnana, which is located in the northern part of central Italy.

Step 3: The summary states that the earthquake was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, while the article only mentions that the tremor was felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.

Step 4: The summary mentions that schools were evacuated in the immediate vicinity, while the article does not mention any evacuations.

Step 5: The summary mentions that the earthquake was "powerful", while the article describes it as a "medium-strong" and "fairly shallow" earthquake.

Step 6: The summary does not mention the aftershocks that were reported in the article.

Step 7: The summary does not mention the previous earthquakes that occurred in the same area last May, which left more than 20 people dead.

Step 8: The summary does not mention the conviction of six scientists and an ex-official for giving a falsely reassuring statement before the 2009 earthquake.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that are significant enough to change the overall meaning of the report.
