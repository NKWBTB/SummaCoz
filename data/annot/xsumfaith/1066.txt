     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Stevenage has signed defender Jamie MacDonald on a two-year deal, but the article does not mention anything about Stevenage.
2. The article mentions that MacDonald made 67 league appearances for National League club Torquay, but the summary does not mention anything about Torquay.
3. The summary states that MacDonald was released by Brighton, but the article does not mention anything about Brighton.
4. The article mentions that MacDonald is a former England Under-19 international, but the summary does not include this information.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides information about a different club (Stevenage) and omits important information about MacDonald's previous clubs (Torquay and Reading) and his international experience.
