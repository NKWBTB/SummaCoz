    Article: 
    Hull city councillor Steven Bayes also pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image when he appeared at the city's crown court.
The 55-year-old was suspended from the Labour Party in October after it "became aware of a police investigation into him", a party spokesman said.
He was released on unconditional bail and is due to stand trial on 5 February 2018 at the same court.
Mr Bayes was first elected as a councillor in 1985.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the former Labour councillor was suspended from the Labour Party in connection with the death of a man in Hull.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the death of a man in Hull. Instead, it reports that the councillor was suspended from the Labour Party in October due to a police investigation into his possession of an extreme pornographic image.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a completely different reason for the councillor's suspension.
4. The article does not provide any information about the death of a man in Hull, and there is no mention of any connection between the councillor's suspension and such a death.
5. Therefore, the summary is not supported by the information in the article, and it is not a consistent summary of the content.
