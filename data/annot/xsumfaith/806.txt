Hull city councillor Steven Bayes also pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image when he appeared at the city's crown court.
The 55-year-old was suspended from the Labour Party in October after it "became aware of a police investigation into him", a party spokesman said.
He was released on unconditional bail and is due to stand trial on 5 February 2018 at the same court.
Mr Bayes was first elected as a councillor in 1985.
He was involved in Hull's bid to secure the UK City of Culture title and is a former vice chair of the Hull 2017 company, which is organising arts activities and events for the year-long celebration.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the councillor was suspended from the Labour Party in connection with the death of a man in Hull.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the death of a man in Hull. Instead, it reports that the councillor was suspended from the Labour Party after a police investigation into his possession of an extreme pornographic image.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the reasons for the councillor's suspension.
4. The article mentions that the councillor was suspended from the Labour Party in October, after the party became aware of a police investigation into him. This suggests that the suspension was related to the police investigation, rather than the death of a man in Hull.
5. Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the councillor was suspended in connection with the death of a man in Hull, when in fact the suspension was related to a police investigation into his possession of an extreme pornographic image.
