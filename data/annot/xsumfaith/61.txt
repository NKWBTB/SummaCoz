For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

  "striker",
  "three-year"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "three-year deal": The article states that Jackson has signed for Barnsley on a "three-year deal", but the article only mentions a single season. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "undisclosed fee": The article does not mention the transfer fee, so this statement in the summary is not supported by the article.
3. "striker": The article refers to Jackson as a "forward", but not as a "striker". Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. "three-year": As mentioned earlier, the article only mentions a single season, so this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies with the article. It is important to carefully review and fact-check information before summarizing it to ensure accuracy and consistency.
