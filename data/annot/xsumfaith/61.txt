    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Barnsley have signed Kayden Jackson for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal.
2. However, the article states that Jackson turned down a contract offer from Wrexham for next season, indicating that he is not signing a three-year deal with Barnsley.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Jackson has signed a three-year deal with Barnsley, while the article states that he has turned down a contract offer from Wrexham.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Jackson has signed a three-year deal with Barnsley, when in fact he has turned down a contract offer from Wrexham.
