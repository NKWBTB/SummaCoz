Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Barnsley have signed Kayden Jackson for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal. However, the article does not mention any transfer fee or contract length.
2. The article states that Jackson turned down a contract offer from Wrexham for next season, indicating that he was already under contract with Wrexham and had the option to extend his stay with the club. However, the summary does not mention anything about Jackson being under contract with Wrexham or turning down a contract offer.
3. The summary mentions that Jackson will fit in nicely to the way Barnsley play, suggesting that he will be a key player for the team. However, the article does not provide any information about Jackson's playing style or his potential role in the team.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides information that is not supported by the text. Specifically, the summary mentions a transfer fee and contract length that are not mentioned in the article, and it also suggests that Jackson will be a key player for Barnsley without providing any evidence to support this claim.
