Find out why.

<Article>
The Reds, who are fifth in National Two South, beat third-placed Chinnor 29-12 for a second win in a row.
"Tommy Phillips, Ben Priddey and Craig Williams really led the team from the front," Churcher told BBC Cornwall.
"If your front row and front five are making 70-plus tackles in a game you're going to be doing well and that's what happened against Chinnor."
The Reds face seven teams who are below them in the table in their next eight games, as well as league leaders Old Elthamians.
Churcher believes his side still has a lot of room for improvement, adding: "Chinnor wasn't the complete performance, but emotionally it was a really dogged performance.
"We've got to build on what we did last weekend, because if we don't, last weekend will have been a waste of time."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "redruth boss marek" - This phrase is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of Marek Churcher being the "boss" of Redruth in the article. The article refers to him as "Churcher" and does not use the word "boss."
2. "redruth boss marek churcher says his side's front row have been key to the club's good form" - This phrase is also not consistent with the article because the article does not quote Churcher as saying this. The article quotes Churcher as saying "If your front row and front five are making 70-plus tackles in a game you're going to be doing well and that's what happened against Chinnor." There is no mention of the front row being key to the club's good form.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains phrases that are not supported by the text of the article.
