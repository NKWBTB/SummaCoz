</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "thirteen people have been charged after climate change protesters stormed onto the runway at Heathrow Airport and chained themselves together."
2. However, the article states that the protesters were from the action group Plane Stupid and were charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome.
3. The article does not mention anything about the protesters storming onto the runway or chaining themselves together.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article.
5. The summary is an over-exaggeration of the events and includes sensational language (stormed onto the runway) that is not supported by the article.
6. The article provides a more factual and accurate account of the protest, which was a peaceful demonstration on the northern runway at 03:30 BST on Monday, whereas the summary is an exaggerated and sensationalized version of the event.
