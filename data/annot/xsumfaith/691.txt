    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Mahama Cho was born in the Ivory Coast, but the article does not mention his birthplace.
2. The summary states that Cho moved to the UK in 1997 in search of a better life, but the article does not mention when he moved to the UK or why he did so.
3. The summary states that Cho experienced physical bullying at school, but the article does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that Cho initially experienced racial abuse, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article mentions that Cho briefly considered representing France, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as Cho's birthplace and the reason for his move to the UK, and omits information that is present in the article, such as the racial abuse he experienced and his brief consideration of representing France.
