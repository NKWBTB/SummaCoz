Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the taekwondo fighter's name is Mahama Cho, but the summary says "great britain's taekwondo fighter mahama cho." This is not consistent, as the article does not mention that Mahama Cho is a British taekwondo fighter.
2. The article states that Mahama Cho was born in the Ivory Coast, but the summary says he was born in the UK. This is not consistent, as the article does not mention that Mahama Cho was born in the UK.
3. The article states that Mahama Cho moved to the UK in 1997 due to physical bullying at school, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it says he moved to the UK in search of a better life, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the following spans have consistency issues:

[ "great britain\\'s taekwondo fighter mahama cho was born in the ivory coast, but after experiencing physical bullying at school he moved to the uk in 1997 in search of a better life" ]
