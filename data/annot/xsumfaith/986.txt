    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was hit by a car in the A96 area of Glasgow.
2. The article states that the incident happened near Dr Gray's Hospital, but it does not mention the A96 area.
3. The summary states that the man was taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.
4. The article states that the man was taken to the hospital, but it does not provide any information about the severity of his injuries.
5. The summary states that the A96 was closed for several hours, but it has since reopened.
6. The article does not mention anything about the A96 being closed or reopened.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides information that is not supported by the article, such as the location of the incident and the severity of the man's injuries. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate summary of the article.
