</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man was hit by a car in the A96 area of Glasgow.
2. The article does not mention that the man was hit by a car. Instead, it states that the man was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries, and that the A96 was closed for several hours.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the man was hit by a car, while the article does not confirm this.
