Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the service was held to mark the surrender of Japan at the end of World War Two, but the summary states that the service was held to mark the 100th anniversary of the city's war memorial. This is inconsistent, as the article does not mention the 100th anniversary of the war memorial.
2. The article mentions that the service was led by Reverend Canon Bob White, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article mentions that the service included readings from Burma veterans and a performance from the Portsmouth Military Wives Choir, but the summary does not mention these details.
4. The article states that wreaths were laid at the war memorial, including one on behalf of the city placed by the Lord Mayor of Portsmouth, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article quotes the council leader Donna Jones as saying that it's important for communities to commemorate events such as these, but the summary does not include this quote.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details and content of the article.
