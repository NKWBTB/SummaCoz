    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a memorial service was held to mark the 100th anniversary of the war memorial, but the article does not mention anything about the memorial's anniversary. Instead, it states that the service was held to mark the surrender of Japan at the end of World War Two.
2. The summary mentions that the service was led by Reverend Canon Bob White, but the article does not mention the name of the person who led the service.
3. The summary states that wreaths were laid at the war memorial, but the article only mentions that one wreath was laid on behalf of the city by the Lord Mayor of Portsmouth.
4. The summary quotes the council leader saying that it's important for communities to commemorate events such as these, but the article does not include this quote.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
