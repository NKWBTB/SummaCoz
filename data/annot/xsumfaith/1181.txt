</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Kyle Edmund, a British player, lost to Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals of the tournament.
2. The summary states that Kyle Edmund is through to the quarterfinals of the Indian Wells Fargo Championship after losing 6-4 6-3.
3. This is inconsistent with the article, as the article states that Edmund lost to Wawrinka, not that he won and advanced to the quarterfinals.
4. The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the information in the article.
5. The article states that Edmund lost 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 6-4 to Wawrinka, but the summary states that he lost 6-4 6-3. This is a clear mistake that leads to the inconsistency.
6. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the correct information should be used to ensure consistency.
