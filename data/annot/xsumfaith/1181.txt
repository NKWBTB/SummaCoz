    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that British number three Kyle Edmund is through to the quarter-finals of the Indian Wells Fargo Championship after losing 6-4 6-3.

This is incorrect because the article states that Edmund lost to Wawrinka, not that he won.

2. The article states that Edmund lost to Wawrinka in three sets, with the scores being 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 6-4.

This contradicts the summary, which states that Edmund lost 6-4 6-3.

3. The article also states that Wawrinka broke serve at 3-2 in the second set and twice in the decider to win in two hours 36 minutes.

This is not mentioned in the summary.

4. The article mentions that Edmund will not play in the semi-finals, as he lost to Wawrinka.

This contradicts the summary, which does not mention that Edmund lost.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about Edmund's outcome in the match and does not include all the information provided in the article.

###Corrected:
