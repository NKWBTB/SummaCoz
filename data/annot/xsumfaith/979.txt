<Article>
In 2014, Sarah Rochira published the results of a major review of the experience of care home residents.
The use of antipsychotic drugs was a recurrent theme which she has branded a "national scandal".
Health boards and care homes have said changes are being made.
The commissioner is asking them to show significant improvements in practice.
"I know professionals don't like this phrase, but across Wales older people in care homes, through the inappropriate use of these drugs, are being 'chemically coshed'. That's the reality of it.
"It is a national scandal. I made that clear when I published my review. I was very clear I would come back and look for evidence of changes and I've now begun that process.
"I will publish the findings from the health boards later this year and I cannot be any clearer in my expectation that they understand how inappropriate the current situation is and that they can evidence real progress."
Antipsychotic drugs are primarily used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
A survey last November by the Royal College of Psychiatrists found nearly one in five - 18% - of dementia patients were being prescribed antipsychotics.
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society in Wales published its own report into the use of medicines in care homes following the Ms Rochira's report.
The society's director in Wales, Mair Davies, told BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme that there were examples of expert practice.
"What we need is to make sure that happens in every care home in Wales," she said.
Steve Ford, the dementia care lead for Care Forum Wales, which represents more than 450 independent care homes in Wales, believes progress is being made.
"We need to look at the underlying reasons for unwanted behaviour that challenges, rather than picking up the phone to the GP and requesting those prescriptions," he said.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Health boards and care homes have said changes are being made" in response to the review by Sarah Rochira. This implies that the health minister is not the only one who has acknowledged the issue and is taking action.
2. The article quotes the health minister as saying "I know professionals don't like this phrase, but across Wales older people in care homes, through the inappropriate use of these drugs, are being 'chemically coshed'. That's the reality of it." This suggests that the health minister is using strong language to describe the situation, but the article does not explicitly state that the health minister is the one who has branded the situation a "national scandal."
3. The summary states that "care homes in wales are 'chemically coshed' drugs, the health minister has told the bbc." This implies that the health minister is the one who has branded the situation a "national scandal," which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it attributes a statement to the health minister that is not supported by the text. The article does not explicitly state that the health minister has branded the situation a "national scandal," and instead emphasizes that health boards and care homes are taking action to address the issue.
