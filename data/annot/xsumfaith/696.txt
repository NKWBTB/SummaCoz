The vehicle was seized, with the three due to be interviewed by officers.
Posting on Twitter, Insp Chris Galley said: "A strange end to a night shift. 15-year-old lad driving a tractor as a taxi for his drunk mates." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the tractor was driven by a 15-year-old boy, but the summary states that the driver was using the tractor as a taxi for his drunk mates. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of the driver using the tractor as a taxi.
2. The article states that the vehicle was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley, but the summary does not mention the location where the tractor was stopped.
3. The article states that the driver had no licence, was not insured, and did not have permission from the tractor's owner, but the summary does not mention these details.
4. The article includes a quote from Insp Chris Galley, but the summary does not include this quote.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the content of the article.
