Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the John Deere tractor was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley. The summary incorrectly states that the tractor was stopped in "north yorkshire."
2. The article does not mention anything about the tractor being driven as a taxi for drunk mates. The summary includes this information, which is not supported by the article.
3. The article mentions that the driver of the tractor had no licence, was not insured, and did not have permission from the owner. The summary does not include any of this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information and leaves out important details that are included in the article.
