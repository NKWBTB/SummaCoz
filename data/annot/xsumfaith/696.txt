</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the driver of the tractor was a 15-year-old boy.
2. The article states that the driver had no licence, was not insured, and did not have permission from the tractor's owner.
3. These three points do not align with the fact that the driver was a 15-year-old boy. In the UK, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 16 to drive a tractor on a public road, and it is unlikely that a 15-year-old boy would have the necessary licence and insurance to operate the vehicle legally.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the driver was a 15-year-old boy, while the article states that the driver was an adult who was not licensed, insured, or authorized to operate the tractor.
