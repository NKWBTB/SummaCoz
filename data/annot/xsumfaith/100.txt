    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    google has pledged $ 1bn ( Â£800m ) to research and research into artificial intelligence ( ai ). 

    Article: 
    The venture's backers include Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Indian tech giant Infosys and Amazon Web Services.
Open AI says it expects its research - free from financial obligations - to focus on a "positive human impact".
Scientists have warned that advances in AI could ultimately threaten humanity.
Mr Musk recently told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that AI was humanity's "biggest existential threat".
Last year, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially "re-design itself at an ever increasing rate", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution.
However, other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote.
A statement on OpenAI's website said the venture aims "to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return".
"It's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it's equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly."
The statement said AI "should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as is possible safely".
It said only a tiny fraction of the $1bn pledged would be spent in the next few years. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Google has pledged $1 billion to research and development of artificial intelligence (AI).

However, the article does not mention Google at all. Instead, it talks about a venture called OpenAI, which is backed by several companies and individuals, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.

2. The article states that OpenAI aims to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity, without the need for financial return.

The summary, on the other hand, mentions that Google has pledged $1 billion to AI research, which implies that the research is being done for financial gain.

3. The article emphasizes the potential risks and benefits of AI, with some experts warning that advances in AI could threaten humanity, while others argue that the risks are remote.

The summary does not mention any of these concerns or potential risks, and instead focuses solely on the $1 billion pledge.

4. The article states that only a tiny fraction of the $1 billion pledged will be spent in the next few years.

The summary does not mention this detail, and implies that the full $1 billion will be spent immediately.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
