<Article>
Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to "concede everything", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people "false hope".
The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.
But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons.
A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was "fairly obvious grandstanding" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.
"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government," the source said.
For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of "waving through the government's plans" and "lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit".
It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.
Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: "The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on."
But the Labour source predicted "residual tensions", adding: "I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering.
"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Liberal Democrats and Labour have clashed in the House of Lords during their latest round of campaigning.
2. However, the article states that the two parties have teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government, but that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments.
3. The article also states that the Lib Dems are determined to insist on the amendments, while Labour is prepared to defer to the Commons, indicating a disagreement between the two parties.
4. Additionally, the article quotes a Labour source as saying that the Lib Dems' actions are "fairly obvious grandstanding" and that they are building up false hope with people worried about their future in Britain.
5. Therefore, it is clear that the two parties do not see eye-to-eye on the issue and have clashed in the House of Lords, contradicting the summary's statement that they have clashed during their latest round of campaigning.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the disagreement between the Liberal Democrats and Labour in the House of Lords. The article portrays a more complex situation, with the two parties having previously teamed up but now disagreeing on how to proceed with the amendments.
