    Summary: 
    the liberal democrats and lib dems have clashed in the house of lords during their latest round of campaigning. 

    Article: 
    Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to "concede everything", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people "false hope".
The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.
But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons.
A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was "fairly obvious grandstanding" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.
"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government," the source said.
For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of "waving through the government's plans" and "lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit".
It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.
Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: "The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on."
But the Labour source predicted "residual tensions", adding: "I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering.
"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like."

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the Liberal Democrats and Labour clashed in the House of Lords, but the article does not mention any clashes or conflicts between the two parties.
2. The summary implies that the Liberal Democrats are trying to give people "false hope" and are engaging in "grandstanding," but the article does not support these claims. In fact, the article states that the Liberal Democrats are determined to insist on their amendments, while Labour is prepared to defer to the Commons.
3. The summary mentions that the two parties have a track record of forming alliances, but the article states that there are now "residual tensions" between them.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the conflict between the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and misrepresents the reasons for their disagreements. The article portrays a more nuanced and complex situation, with both parties having valid reasons for their positions and no clear clashes or tensions between them.
