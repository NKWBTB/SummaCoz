<Summary>
an investigation into the disappearance of a woman who was allegedly murdered is to be probed by the police watchdog.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the police watchdog is investigating the disappearance of a woman who was allegedly murdered.
2. However, the article states that the body of India Chipchase was found, and the defendant, Edward Tenniswood, has been charged with murder.
3. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the police are investigating the disappearance of the woman, as her body has already been found and a charge has been brought against the defendant.
4. Additionally, the article does not mention any investigation into the police's actions, which is a key aspect of the police watchdog's remit.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
