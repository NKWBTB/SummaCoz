A statement issued by the force said: "Northamptonshire Police has made a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to ensure transparency in examining police action and responses before and during the search for India Chipchase.
"We await the decision of the IPCC and will not be commenting further as the criminal investigation is now in the court process."
On Thursday Mr Tenniswood appeared at Northampton Crown Court via video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.
When asked if he could hear, Mr Tenniswood told the clerk of the court: "I can hear you, definitely."
After that he spoke only to confirm he could see the Judge Rupert Mayo, prosecutor Mary Loram and his lawyer Derek Johashen.
There was no application for bail and he was remanded in custody.
Ms Chipchase was last seen by friends on Bridge Street at about 01:15 GMT on Saturday.
Her disappearance was reported later that day after she failed to turn up to work at The Collingtree pub and restaurant.
Her body was found at the defendant's terraced house in Stanley Road. A post-mortem examination concluded she died as a result of pressure to the neck.
There will be a plea hearing on the 25 May, and a trial date was set for 18 July, to last for 10 days.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Northamptonshire Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to ensure transparency in examining police action and responses before and during the search for India Chipchase. This implies that the police are investigating their own actions and responses, which is not what the phrase "police watchdog" typically conveys.
2. The term "watchdog" typically implies an external agency that is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the actions of the police. In this case, the IPCC is an external agency, but it is being referred to as "the police" in the summary, which is not accurate.
3. The summary also states that the investigation into the disappearance of India Chipchase is to be probed by the police watchdog, which is not accurate. The IPCC is not a watchdog in the classical sense, but rather an independent body that investigates complaints against the police.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it uses the term "watchdog" in a way that is not accurate and does not convey the correct information about the role of the IPCC in the investigation.
