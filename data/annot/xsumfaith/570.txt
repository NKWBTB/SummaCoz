A statement issued by the force said: "Northamptonshire Police has made a referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to ensure transparency in examining police action and responses before and during the search for India Chipchase.
"We await the decision of the IPCC and will not be commenting further as the criminal investigation is now in the court process."
On Thursday Mr Tenniswood appeared at Northampton Crown Court via video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.
When asked if he could hear, Mr Tenniswood told the clerk of the court: "I can hear you, definitely."
After that he spoke only to confirm he could see the Judge Rupert Mayo, prosecutor Mary Loram and his lawyer Derek Johashen.
There was no application for bail and he was remanded in custody.
Ms Chipchase was last seen by friends on Bridge Street at about 01:15 GMT on Saturday.
Her disappearance was reported later that day after she failed to turn up to work at The Collingtree pub and restaurant.
Her body was found at the defendant's terraced house in Stanley Road. A post-mortem examination concluded she died as a result of pressure to the neck.
There will be a plea hearing on the 25 May, and a trial date was set for 18 July, to last for 10 days.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the police watchdog is investigating the disappearance of the woman, while the article states that the police have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over their "responses before and during the search" for the woman. This suggests that the police are being investigated for their actions during the investigation, rather than the disappearance itself.
2. The summary does not mention the fact that the body of the woman was found, and that the accused, Edward Tenniswood, has been charged with murder. These details are not present in the summary, which makes it incomplete and not consistent with the article.
3. The summary mentions a "plea hearing" and a "trial date", which suggests that the case is still ongoing, while the article states that Tenniswood has appeared in court via video link and has been remanded in custody. This implies that the case has already progressed further than the summary suggests.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information presented in the article, and is therefore not consistent with it.
