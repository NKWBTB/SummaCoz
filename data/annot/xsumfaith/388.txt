    Summary: 
    plans for a new hotel in east dorset have been approved by councillors. 

    Article: 
    Three Victorian hotels will go to make way for a six-storey, four star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, at East Cliff in Bournemouth.
English Heritage strongly objected to the scale of the development in what is a designated conservation area.
But, councillors voted seven to three in favour saying it would help tourism.
Chair of the planning board and Conservative ward councillor David Kelsey, said the buildings earmarked for demolition were nice but no longer "necessarily functional".
"They've come to the end of their working lives, we need to preserve the tourism aspect while improving living for older people in the town," he said.
"The loss of buildings and trees are always regrettable but we can't stand still, we need to move forward."
The site on Grove Road and East Overcliff Drive will get a 90-room hotel along with a nine-storey and seven-storey building, comprising 122 assisted-living apartments.
Applicants The East Cliff Project LLP will demolish Bay View Court, The Cottonwood and the Ocean View hotels.
The council received 246 letters supporting the plans.
Forty-nine residents and the Ancient Monuments Society wrote to object to the demolition, stating that despite being altered, they still "give a sense of the historic character of the area".
English Heritage said the scale of the development would cause "severe harm" to the conservation area. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that plans for a new hotel in east Dorset have been approved by councillors. However, the article states that the plans were approved despite strong objections from English Heritage and other local residents.

2. The summary does not mention anything about the demolition of existing hotels or the construction of assisted-living apartment blocks, which are key aspects of the article.

3. The article states that the development will include a six-storey, four-star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, which is not mentioned in the summary.

4. The summary does not mention the objections from English Heritage or the Ancient Monuments Society, which are significant details that are included in the article.

5. The article states that the council received 246 letters supporting the plans, but the summary does not mention this fact.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide an accurate summary of the article's content, and it omits several key details that are included in the article.
