<Article>
Three Victorian hotels will go to make way for a six-storey, four star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, at East Cliff in Bournemouth.
English Heritage strongly objected to the scale of the development in what is a designated conservation area.
But, councillors voted seven to three in favour saying it would help tourism.
Chair of the planning board and Conservative ward councillor David Kelsey, said the buildings earmarked for demolition were nice but no longer "necessarily functional".
"They've come to the end of their working lives, we need to preserve the tourism aspect while improving living for older people in the town," he said.
"The loss of buildings and trees are always regrettable but we can't stand still, we need to move forward."
The site on Grove Road and East Overcliff Drive will get a 90-room hotel along with a nine-storey and seven-storey building, comprising 122 assisted-living apartments.
Applicants The East Cliff Project LLP will demolish Bay View Court, The Cottonwood and the Ocean View hotels.
The council received 246 letters supporting the plans.
Forty-nine residents and the Ancient Monuments Society wrote to object to the demolition, stating that despite being altered, they still "give a sense of the historic character of the area".
English Heritage said the scale of the development would cause "severe harm" to the conservation area.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the development is in Bournemouth, not Dorset. The summary incorrectly states that the development is in East Dorset.
2. The article uses the term "East Cliff" to refer to the location of the development, while the summary uses the term "East Dorset". This is a inconsistency as "East Cliff" is a specific location within Bournemouth, while "East Dorset" is a broader geographic area that includes multiple locations.
3. The article mentions that the development will involve the demolition of three hotels, while the summary does not mention this detail.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, as it contains inconsistencies in terms of location and details about the development.
