    Summary: 
    us tv star rosie o \'donnell has said she is " lucky to be alive " after having a heart attack in her new home. 

    Article: 
    The 50 year-old said she was "lucky to be here" after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online.
O'Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched "women's heart attack symptoms", which included sudden nausea and aches, before taking a few aspirin.
She visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked.
O'Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became nauseous and feverish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Nyack village home, near New York.
In the blog entry on her website, a poem entitled "my heart attack", O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the "widow maker".
The star, who has acted in several films and TV shows including Drop Dead Diva, Will and Grace and Nip/Tuck, also said she did not call the emergency services.
However, she issued a warning to her readers: "Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911."
She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gameshow was cancelled in March due to low ratings. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Rosie O'Donnell had a heart attack, but the article does not mention any heart attack. Instead, the article states that O'Donnell experienced sudden nausea and aches after helping someone get out of their car, and she searched for women's heart attack symptoms online before visiting a cardiologist.
2. The summary also states that O'Donnell is "lucky to be alive," but the article does not contain this phrase. Instead, O'Donnell wrote in her blog that she was "lucky to be here" after experiencing symptoms and seeking medical attention.
3. The summary mentions that O'Donnell did not call the emergency services, but the article states that she did visit a cardiologist the next day.
4. The summary refers to O'Donnell as a TV star, but the article does not use this language. Instead, it refers to her as an actress who has appeared in several TV shows and films.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations compared to the article. For example, the summary mentions a heart attack, which is not mentioned in the article, and it states that O'Donnell is "lucky to be alive," which is not a direct quote from the article. Additionally, the summary refers to O'Donnell as a TV star, which is not the language used in the article.
