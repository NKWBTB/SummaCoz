The report focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK.
The line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms.
Network Rail said the study would be "key" to long-term developments.
The report, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, said that 10% of journeys on the line, which was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014, could be affected by 2040.
The report said adverse weather disrupted the line about 10 days per year, but according to sea-level predictions that could rise to almost 40 by 2040 and up to 120 by 2100.
Academics from Plymouth University, the University of Leeds and the University of York identified a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years.
The academics said there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales, south-east England, the Cumbrian coast and Scotland.
Dr David Dawson, from the University of Leeds, said the long-term future of the line was "really worrying".
The report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds.
Network Rail said it hoped to develop "long-term interventions" to "secure the future" of the line.
The Department for Transport said it had invested Â£31m into improving the resilience of the route and was "exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area".
In January, the prime minister backed a new Okehampton railway route as the "most resilient" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line.

climate change could disrupt up to a third of rail services travelling to and from the south west within the next 100 years, a study suggests.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "climate change could disrupt up to a third of rail services travelling to and from the south west within the next 100 years",
  "a third of rail services travelling to and from the south west within the next 100 years"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "10% of journeys on the line could be affected by 2040" due to sea level rises. This is a much smaller percentage than the summary's claim of "up to a third of rail services."
2. The article also mentions that the line is currently closed for two months each year due to storm damage, and that this could increase to 120 days by 2100. However, the summary does not mention this information.
3. The article states that the study predicts that adverse weather could disrupt the line up to 120 days by 2100, but the summary does not provide this specific information.
4. The article mentions that the study found a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article states that diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds, but the summary does not mention this.
6. The article mentions that the Department for Transport has invested Â£31m into improving the resilience of the route, but the summary does not mention this.
7. The article mentions that the prime minister has backed a new Okehampton railway route as the "most resilient" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line, but the summary does not mention this.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary does not accurately represent the information in the article. The summary exaggerates the potential impact of sea level rises on rail services, fails to mention specific details about the study's findings, and omits important information about the Department for Transport's investment and the prime minister's support for an alternative railway route.
