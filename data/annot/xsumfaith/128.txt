<Article>
Lance Corporal Trimaan "Harry" Dhillon stalked Alice Ruggles before fatally attacking her last October.
Her parents Sue Hills and Clive Ruggles described the moment two Northumbria Police officers knocked on their door.
Prof Ruggles said: "And then they said to us Alice has been killed. And we looked at each other and said 'It's Harry'. We knew, we knew even then."
The trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard Dhillon had become obsessed with the 24-year-old and had stalked her.
Dr Hills told of her guilt about trying to reassure her daughter on the phone two days before.
She said: "And I sort of reassured her that was ok, the police knew what was going on and that it would be all right and if she just ignored him he would ignore her.
"And I only put the phone down for 10 minutes and Emma (daughter) rang and said 'You cannot tell that to her, he's going to kill her. You have got to do something'.
"And I thought she was over-reacting so I just said 'don't be silly'.
"And so of course as soon as I saw the police I knew that's that what it was.
"And I felt such a sense of guilt for having first of all told Alice not to worry and secondly told Emma not to be silly when actually if I hadn't said that Alice might still be alive."
Prof Ruggles said he didn't think any of them, including his daughter, realised how serious the situation was despite the signs.
Her parents have set up the Alice Ruggles Trust and they said they were hoping to use that and their daughter's "vibrant personality" to make other people aware of the dangers of stalking.
They said they wanted her to be remembered for that and as "smiling and laughing and making some sort of cheeky comment."
Dhillon, 26, denied murder but was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years.

<Summary>
a mother who was murdered by a soldier has been jailed for three years.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the mother was murdered by a soldier, but the article states that it was Lance Corporal Trimaan "Harry" Dhillon who stalked and killed Alice Ruggles, not a soldier.
2. The summary mentions that the mother was jailed for three years, but the article does not mention any jail sentence for the mother.
3. The article states that Dhillon was found guilty of murder and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years, but the summary does not mention any sentence for Dhillon.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the victim, the perpetrator, and the sentence. The summary should have been more careful in summarizing the article to ensure accuracy and consistency.
