Find out why.

<Article>
Plans include relocating the town's Central Library and cutting back on the Citizens Advice Bureau.
The council will also work with traders to find a private buyer for the town's Victorian indoor market.
The Labour-run authority said it was implementing the cuts "with a heavy heart" and blamed "severe austerity cuts imposed by central government".
Councillor Bill Dixon, leader of the authority, said that tough choices had been made, but local people had been able to comment during a public consultation.
"There were other cuts that people didn't want us to make," he said.
"Withdrawing school patrol crossings for example - some authorities have done that, this authority decided not to."
Responding to protesters opposed to the relocation of the Crown Street Library to the Dolphin Centre, he said:  "I was born and bred in the town.
"I do understand the attachment to Crown Street Library, but we should emphasise we are not closing the library but moving it."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the council is implementing cuts "with a heavy heart" due to severe austerity cuts imposed by central government. This implies that the council does not have much flexibility in terms of making decisions and is instead being forced to make cuts.
2. The summary states that the council has "rubber stamped moves aimed at making #10m savings over the next four years." This implies that the council has actively chosen to make these cuts and is taking a proactive approach to saving money.
3. The article does not mention any specific moves or decisions that the council has made to save money. Instead, it focuses on the cuts that the council is being forced to make due to austerity measures.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that the council has "rubber stamped moves aimed at making #10m savings over the next four years" is not consistent with the information in the article. The article does not suggest that the council is actively choosing to make savings or taking a proactive approach to cutting costs. Instead, it emphasizes the negative impact of austerity measures on the council's ability to provide services.

Overall, the summary statement is not consistent with the information in the article because it implies that the council has more control over its financial decisions than the article suggests.
