<Article>
Hospital radiographer Aidan McNicholl, 36, died following the collision on the A5 at Cerrigydrudion on Sunday.
Andreas Werner, 46, of Leipzig, failed to spot the motorcyclist as he turned his VW Transporter right causing the fatal crash.
The father-of-four pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Llandudno Magistrates' Court.
He was fined Â£1,000 and also banned from driving in the UK for two years.
Prosecutor Sarah Marsh told the court the victim's family saw no value in Werner, who was staying in a cottage with his family near Bala, being sent to jail.
She said: "They accept it was a momentary lapse and nothing will bring him back."
Craig Hutchinson, defending, said Werner was remorseful and could offer no explanation for the crash.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "jailed for six years",
  "conwy county",
  "six years"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "jailed for six years": The article states that Werner was fined £1,000 and banned from driving in the UK for two years, but it does not mention a jail sentence. Therefore, the statement "jailed for six years" is not consistent with the article.
2. "conwy county": The article does not mention the location of the crash or the name of the county where it occurred. Therefore, the statement "conwy county" is not consistent with the article.
3. "six years": The article does not mention the length of time Werner was banned from driving. It only states that he was banned for two years. Therefore, the statement "six years" is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, including the length of Werner's sentence, the location of the crash, and the length of his driving ban.
