Hospital radiographer Aidan McNicholl, 36, died following the collision on the A5 at Cerrigydrudion on Sunday.
Andreas Werner, 46, of Leipzig, failed to spot the motorcyclist as he turned his VW Transporter right causing the fatal crash.
The father-of-four pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Llandudno Magistrates' Court.
He was fined Â£1,000 and also banned from driving in the UK for two years.
Prosecutor Sarah Marsh told the court the victim's family saw no value in Werner, who was staying in a cottage with his family near Bala, being sent to jail.
She said: "They accept it was a momentary lapse and nothing will bring him back."
Craig Hutchinson, defending, said Werner was remorseful and could offer no explanation for the crash.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the driver, Andreas Werner, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was fined £1,000 and banned from driving in the UK for two years.
2. The summary states that the driver was jailed for six years.
3. These two statements are not consistent with each other. The article states that Werner was not jailed, but the summary states that he was jailed for six years.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

The reason for this inconsistency is likely that the summary is incorrect and should not have been written as "jailed for six years" but rather as "fined £1,000 and banned from driving in the UK for two years" like the article states.
