    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the driver who killed a motorcyclist was jailed for six years.

However, the article states that the driver, Andreas Werner, was fined £1,000 and banned from driving in the UK for two years, but there is no mention of a jail sentence.

2. The summary mentions that the driver failed to spot the motorcyclist as he turned right, causing the fatal crash.

The article confirms that the crash occurred when Werner turned right onto the A5 and failed to spot McNicholl on his motorcycle.

3. The summary states that the victim's family saw no value in Werner being sent to jail.

The article reports that the prosecutor, Sarah Marsh, stated that the victim's family accepted that the crash was a momentary lapse and that nothing would bring McNicholl back. However, there is no mention of the family seeing no value in Werner being sent to jail.

4. The summary states that Werner was remorseful and could offer no explanation for the crash.

The article reports that Werner was remorseful and offered no explanation for the crash.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a jail sentence, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary misrepresents the victim's family's views on the sentence, and the article does not mention Werner being remorseful.
