</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The first sentence of the summary states that Nottingham Panthers secured their place in the elite league play-offs with a 4-1 win over Nottingham Panthers. This is incorrect, as there is no such team as Nottingham Panthers.
2. The article mentions that the teams are playing a double-header, with the second match taking place on Saturday night. This implies that the first match, which the summary refers to as a 4-1 win for Nottingham Panthers, has not yet been played.
3. The article states that Nottingham Panthers are leading the league on 28 points, with Sheffield Steelers on 27 points and Belfast on 25 points. This suggests that Nottingham Panthers have not yet secured their place in the play-offs, as the league is still ongoing.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it incorrectly states that Nottingham Panthers have secured their place in the play-offs, when in fact they have not yet done so.
