]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Giants got a short-handed opener, Jeff Dimmen pulled the Panthers level, and Mike Forney's powerplay breakaway goal made it 2-1. This means that the score was not a 4-1 win for Nottingham Panthers.
2. The summary claims that Nottingham Panthers secured their place in the elite league play-offs with a 4-1 win over Nottingham Panthers. This is not supported by the article, as the score was not 4-1 in favor of Nottingham Panthers.
3. The article states that Mike Radja scored from an acute angle and James Desmarais made it 4-2 before Nottingham's David Ling got one back. This means that the final score was 4-3 in favor of Nottingham Panthers, not 4-1 as stated in the summary.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Nottingham Panthers secured their place in the elite league play-offs with a 4-1 win over Nottingham Panthers is not consistent with the information provided in the article.
