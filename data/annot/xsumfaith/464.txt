    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Nottingham Panthers secured their place in the elite league play-offs with a 4-1 win over Nottingham Panthers. This is incorrect, as the article states that the Panthers played against the Giants, not each other.
2. The summary also states that Nottingham Panthers won the game 4-1, but the article states that the final score was 4-2 in favor of the Giants.
3. The summary mentions nothing about the Giants, while the article states that the Giants played against the Panthers and that the Giants got a short-handed opener through player-coach Derrick Walser.
4. The summary does not mention the powerplay breakaway goal by Mike Forney, the equalizing goal by Andy Bohmback, or the other goals scored by Mike Radja and James Desmarais.
5. The summary does not mention the fact that the teams will meet again on Saturday night in the second match of their double-header.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the game between the Giants and the Panthers, and it does not include many of the key details mentioned in the article.
