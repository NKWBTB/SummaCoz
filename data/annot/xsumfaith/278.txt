Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Private Derby XXX was promoted to the rank of lance corporal, but the summary states that he was awarded the freedom of the city of Derbyshire. These two statements are not consistent, as there is no mention of Private Derby XXX being awarded the freedom of the city in the article.
2. The article states that Private Derby XXX was promoted for "good behaviour", but the summary does not mention this reason for the award.
3. The article provides specific details about Private Derby XXX's background and career, such as his joining the regiment in February 2014 and his participation in various events, but the summary does not include any of these details.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies between the article and the summary, it can be concluded that the summary is not consistent with the article.
