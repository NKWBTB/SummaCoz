<Article>
Private Derby XXX was promoted to the rank of lance corporal at an event in Chester marking eight years of the Mercian Regiment.
He was awarded his honour by the colonel of the regiment, Brigadier Andrew Williams.
The Swaledale ram, who is officially classed as a soldier, received his promotion for "good behaviour".
He is the 30th in a line of mascot rams running back to the Indian Mutiny War in the mid-19th Century.
The first Private Derby was acquired in 1858 by the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot and became the mascot of the Mercian Regiment when it formed in 2007.
Lance Corporal Derby XXX joined the regiment in February 2014.
He has his own army number, gets paid to buy his rations and takes his holidays during the mating season on the Chatsworth Estate in Derbyshire.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "former soldier from derbyshire",
  "from derbyshire",
  "freedom of the city of derbyshire"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "former soldier from derbyshire" - The article does not mention anything about the soldier being a "former" soldier. Private Derby XXX is currently serving as a mascot for the Mercian Regiment, so this phrase is not accurate.
2. "from derbyshire" - The article does not mention the soldier's place of origin. Private Derby XXX is a mascot for the Mercian Regiment, which is a British Army regiment, not a Derbyshire-based regiment.
3. "freedom of the city of derbyshire" - The article does not mention anything about the soldier being awarded the "freedom of the city" or any other honorary title. The article only mentions that Private Derby XXX was promoted to the rank of lance corporal and received his promotion for "good behaviour".

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues in the following spans:

* "former soldier from derbyshire" - The soldier is not a "former" soldier, he is currently serving as a mascot.
* "from derbyshire" - The soldier is not from Derbyshire, he is a mascot for the Mercian Regiment.
* "freedom of the city of derbyshire" - The soldier has not been awarded any honorary title or freedom.

The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
