    Summary: 
    a former soldier from derbyshire has been awarded the freedom of the city of derbyshire. 

    Article: 
    Private Derby XXX was promoted to the rank of lance corporal at an event in Chester marking eight years of the Mercian Regiment.
He was awarded his honour by the colonel of the regiment, Brigadier Andrew Williams.
The Swaledale ram, who is officially classed as a soldier, received his promotion for "good behaviour".
He is the 30th in a line of mascot rams running back to the Indian Mutiny War in the mid-19th Century.
The first Private Derby was acquired in 1858 by the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot and became the mascot of the Mercian Regiment when it formed in 2007.
Lance Corporal Derby XXX joined the regiment in February 2014.
He has his own army number, gets paid to buy his rations and takes his holidays during the mating season on the Chatsworth Estate in Derbyshire.
During his career, Lance Corporal Derby XXX has also helped switch on the Christmas lights in Ashbourne and met Prince William at the unveiling of a memorial commemorating the 1914 Christmas Truce. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a former soldier from Derbyshire was awarded the freedom of the city of Derbyshire. However, the article does not mention anything about the soldier being awarded the freedom of the city. Instead, it talks about Private Derby XXX being promoted to the rank of lance corporal.
2. The summary mentions that the soldier is a former soldier, implying that they are no longer in the military. However, the article states that Private Derby XXX is still serving in the Mercian Regiment and has been promoted to the rank of lance corporal.
3. The summary does not provide any information about Private Derby XXX's achievements or why they were awarded the freedom of the city. The article, on the other hand, provides detailed information about Private Derby XXX's career and achievements, such as his promotion to lance corporal, his holidays on the Chatsworth Estate, and his involvement in switching on the Christmas lights in Ashbourne.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
