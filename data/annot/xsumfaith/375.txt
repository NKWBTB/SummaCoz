It will be able to issue warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws.
The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT.
Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work.
People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary.
However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached.
James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the new service will be provided by Powys council, not the National Crime Agency (NCA).
2. The article mentions that the service will be funded by the UK government and will replace the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), while the summary does not mention the OFT or the funding source.
3. The article explains that the service will deal with complaints about estate agents and will have the power to issue warning and banning orders, while the summary only mentions a new role service in Powys without any information about the nature of the service or its powers.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content or details of the article.
