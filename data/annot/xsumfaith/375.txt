It will be able to issue warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws.
The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT.
Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work.
People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary.
However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached.
James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future.
He spoke to Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales' Peter Johnson about what the new role will involve. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the National Crime Agency (NCA) is launching a new role service in Powys. However, the article does not mention the NCA at all. Instead, it talks about Powys Council taking over the role of enforcing the Estate Agents Act.
2. The summary mentions that the new role service will issue warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws. However, the article only mentions that Powys Council will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work and that they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached. There is no mention of warning or banning orders.
3. The summary states that James Munro from Powys Council will lead the new team. However, the article does not mention James Munro or any specific individual leading the new team.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention the NCA, warning or banning orders, or James Munro, all of which are mentioned in the summary.
