    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions that the smartphone maker has developed a new smartphone that allows users to download products to android smartphones and smartphones. This is not consistent with the article, as the article only mentions the Dtek50 smartphone and does not mention anything about downloading products to other devices.
2. The article states that the Dtek50 smartphone offers improved security over rival Android devices, but the summary does not mention anything about security. This is a significant inconsistency, as the article highlights the security features of the device as a key selling point.
3. The summary mentions that the phone will cost less than its previous handset Priv, but the article does not provide any information about the pricing of the Dtek50 smartphone. This is an inconsistency, as the article only mentions the price of the previous handset, the Priv.
4. The article states that the Dtek50 is the company's second Android handset after switching focus away from its struggling BB10 platform, but the summary does not mention anything about the company's switch to Android or the BB10 platform. This is a significant inconsistency, as the article provides important background information about the company's decision to switch to Android.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary omits important details, such as the security features and the price of the Dtek50 smartphone, and includes information that is not present in the article, such as the ability to download products to other devices.
