It comes after a jury concluded the death of a man from St Austell was suicide, while undergoing care 140 miles from where he lived.
David Knight was killed by a train near St Austell after going on leave from a Somerset hospital.
The Department of Health has admitted "unacceptable" patients "are receiving care far from home".

BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died.
A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset.
The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.
The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to Â£11.7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care "must be eliminated by 2020/21".
"We will work to a faster timetable if at all possible," said a spokeswoman.
"We will consider Dr Carlyon's letter in detail once it arrives."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the death of David Knight was ruled as suicide by a coroner, but the summary incorrectly states that the coroner said he was killed by a suicide bomber.
2. The article does not mention anything about a suicide bomber. The only mention of suicide is in the context of the coroner's ruling on David Knight's death.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a new and false detail about the cause of David Knight's death.
4. The article focuses on the issue of mental health patients in Cornwall receiving care far from home, and the Department of Health's response to this issue. The summary does not address this issue at all.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a false and misleading detail about the cause of David Knight's death, and does not address the main issue of mental health patients in Cornwall receiving care far from home.
