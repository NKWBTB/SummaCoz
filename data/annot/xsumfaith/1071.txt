    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "fertility treatment," but the article does not mention anything about Ms. Jones undergoing fertility treatment. Instead, it mentions that she was concerned she had left it too late to have a baby after filming a documentary about fertility.
2. The summary states that Ms. Jones is concerned for the treatment of the fertility treatment, but the article does not mention anything about the treatment of fertility. It only mentions Ms. Jones' concerns about her own ability to have a baby.
3. The summary does not mention the name of Ms. Jones' partner, Charlie Thomson, who is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
