Police said that someone opened fire from a passing car and witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired close to the main police station.
"Nothing is known about the culprits yet but we can guess that this involves local crime gangs," investigators told German media.
The suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off.
The shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, as local people enjoyed the Ascension Day holiday in the sunshine.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "ascension square in ascension square",
  "in ascension square in ascension square",
  "two shots"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "ascension square in ascension square": The phrase "in ascension square" is repeated twice, which is not correct. The first instance of "ascension square" should be sufficient to convey the location of the event.
2. "in ascension square in ascension square": This phrase is a repetition of the previous error, and it should be removed altogether.
3. "two shots": The summary states "two shots" were fired, but the article mentions "up to a dozen shots" were fired. This discrepancy indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary should be revised to correct these consistency issues and accurately reflect the information in the article. Here's a revised version:

<Revised Summary>
