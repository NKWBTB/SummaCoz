    Summary: 
    a school has been sent back to school after being sent off by students at a school in london. 

    Article: 
    Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday, with almost 10% of pupils failing to reach the academy's standards.
Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures.
But Hanson Academy claims it "communicated clearly" its expectations for this school year.
Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers.
Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed.
Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday.
She said in an earlier statement: "We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.
"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.
"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn."
The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for "adult life".
She said: "This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect.
"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other.
"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school."
Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes.
She said: "It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather."
She said buying new shoes was not an easy option.
"I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important."
Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps.
"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes," she said.
Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home.
Fiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: "Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00.
"So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon."
The school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents.
She said the school would work with parents who were struggling to dress their children appropriately. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the school was "sent back to school" after being sent off by students, but the article does not mention anything about the school being sent off or closed.
2. The summary mentions that the school has been strict with its uniform policy, but the article does not mention anything about the uniform policy being the reason for the school's actions.
3. The summary states that the school sent home 63 pupils on Wednesday, but the article only mentions that 63 pupils were sent home on Tuesday.
4. The summary mentions that the school's policy is to send home students who do not meet the uniform standards, but the article states that the school is enforcing its uniform policy strictly and that students are being sent home for a variety of reasons, including wearing hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear, patterned trousers, and not having the correct footwear.
5. The summary does not mention anything about the school's reasons for sending home the students, but the article states that the school is enforcing its policy to prepare students for "adult life" and that the rules are an important part of the educational experience.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the school's actions and reasons for sending home the students.
