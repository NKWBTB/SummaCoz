Shanghai have signed the Argentina forward, 32, from Boca Juniors but no details were given over the contract.
Shanghai, coached by ex-Brighton boss Gus Poyet, are reported to have agreed a deal worth £40m for Tevez including a salary in excess of £310,000 a week.
Boca Juniors said: "Good luck Carlitos. You will always be in our hearts."
Tevez played for seven years in the Premier League and won the title with both Manchester clubs.
He also lifted the Champions League trophy with United in 2008 before joining Juventus in 2013, where he won two Italian championships.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Shanghai SIPG have signed Carlos Tevez from Boca Juniors, but no details were given over the contract.
2. The summary claims that Boca Juniors has become the first Premier League club to be named in the club's history of the Premier League.
3. This statement is not consistent with the article, as Boca Juniors is not a Premier League club. It is an Argentine club that Tevez played for before joining Shanghai SIPG.
4. The article does not mention anything about Boca Juniors being the first Premier League club, nor does it mention the club's history in the Premier League.
5. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not supported by the article and is considered inconsistent.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it makes a claim about Boca Juniors being a Premier League club, which is not true.
