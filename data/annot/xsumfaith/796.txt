     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Boca Juniors is the first Premier League club to be named in the club's history of the Premier League, but this is not true. Boca Juniors is an Argentine club and has never played in the Premier League.
2. The article mentions that Shanghai SIPG has signed Carlos Tevez from Boca Juniors, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The summary mentions that Tevez will be playing for Shanghai, but the article does not provide any information about Tevez's move to Shanghai.
4. The article mentions that Chelsea has agreed terms with Shanghai SIPG for Brazil midfielder Oscar, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
