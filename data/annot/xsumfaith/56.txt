</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Novak Djokovic lost to Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in the singles tournament, but the summary states that he was knocked out of the Olympic men's doubles. This is inconsistent, as Djokovic did not participate in the doubles tournament.
2. The article also states that Djokovic won his 30th Masters title in Toronto before the Olympics, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it makes reference to Djokovic participating in the doubles tournament and winning a Masters title that he did not actually win.
