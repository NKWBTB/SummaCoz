For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "knocked out of the olympic",
  "novak",
  "olympic men\\'s doubles in the final",
  "doubles",
  "final",
  "two"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "knocked out of the Olympic" - The article does not mention that Djokovic was knocked out of the Olympics. Instead, it states that he lost to Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in the singles.
2. "novak" - The article refers to Djokovic as "Djokovic" throughout, not "novak".
3. "olympic men's doubles in the final" - The article does not mention anything about Djokovic playing in the doubles or the Olympics.
4. "doubles" - The article only mentions Djokovic's singles loss to del Potro, not any doubles match.
5. "final" - The article does not mention any final match for Djokovic.
6. "two" - The article does not mention Djokovic's ranking or any specific number of titles he has won.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations.
