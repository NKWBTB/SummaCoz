    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistency

The summary states that Novak Djokovic was knocked out of the Olympic men's doubles in the final, but the article does not mention anything about the Olympic men's doubles. Instead, the article talks about Djokovic being knocked out of the singles and the doubles tournament.

Step 2: Analyze the article

The article states that Djokovic was knocked out of the singles by Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, and that he also lost in the doubles tournament with partner Nenad Zimonjic. However, the article does not mention anything about Djokovic being knocked out of the Olympic men's doubles.

Step 3: Analyze the summary

The summary states that Djokovic was knocked out of the Olympic men's doubles in the final, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that Djokovic was knocked out of the singles and the doubles tournament, but does not specify which doubles tournament he was knocked out of.

Step 4: Identify the reason for the inconsistency

The reason for the inconsistency is that the summary is referring to a different tournament than the article. The summary is referring to the Olympic men's doubles, while the article is referring to the singles and doubles tournaments at Wimbledon and the Olympics.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it refers to a different tournament than the article. The article only mentions the singles and doubles tournaments at Wimbledon and the Olympics, but not the Olympic men's doubles.
