The two teams faced off in Patras, Greece, earlier this month, with European title contenders Greece running out winners, 92-64.
Three members of that team will be missing at the Copper Box, however, offering GB a chance of revenge.
"I think it's going to be amazing - I'm from Stratford so I love playing there [at the Copper Box]," said GB guard Teddy Okereafor.
"This is the level we need to be playing at to make sure we're 100% ready for EuroBasket this year.
"We've got a couple of guys who are going to be playing for the first time in London so it's going to be exciting for them - I think the atmosphere's going to be great."
The game will be Britain's only home game before they compete at FIBA EuroBasket 2017, which starts at the beginning of September with a qualifying group in Istanbul, Turkey.
After they play Greece, coach Joe Prunty's team travel to a four-team tournament in Poland, their last warm-up games before EuroBasket starts.
