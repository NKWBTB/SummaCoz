The two teams faced off in Patras, Greece, earlier this month, with European title contenders Greece running out winners, 92-64.
Three members of that team will be missing at the Copper Box, however, offering GB a chance of revenge.
"I think it's going to be amazing - I'm from Stratford so I love playing there [at the Copper Box]," said GB guard Teddy Okereafor.
"This is the level we need to be playing at to make sure we're 100% ready for EuroBasket this year.
"We've got a couple of guys who are going to be playing for the first time in London so it's going to be exciting for them - I think the atmosphere's going to be great."
The game will be Britain's only home game before they compete at FIBA EuroBasket 2017, which starts at the beginning of September with a qualifying group in Istanbul, Turkey.
After they play Greece, coach Joe Prunty's team travel to a four-team tournament in Poland, their last warm-up games before EuroBasket starts.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "bbc sport\\'s football expert mark lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest for the copper box"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "bbc sport's football expert mark lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest for the copper box."
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Mark Lawrenson or football. The article is about the GB men's basketball team playing against Greece at the Copper Box.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is talking about a different topic (football) and a different person (Mark Lawrenson) than the article.

So, the consistency issue is that the summary is discussing a different topic and person than the article.
