The jazz film is the follow up to director Damien Chazelle's Academy Award-winning film Whiplash.
The People's Choice, voted for by the audience, has proved to be a decent predictor for Oscars success in recent years.
Previous winners include 12 Years a Slave and The King's Speech.
La La Land, set for release in December, stars Stone as an aspiring actress in Los Angeles who meets a jazz pianist (Gosling) who is trying to stay true to the music he has devoted himself to.
The film also stars singer John Legend and JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in Whiplash.
La La Land has enjoyed rave reviews since premiering at the Venice Film Festival in August.
Chazelle wrote the script six years ago but was not able to persuade anyone to make it until he broke through with Whiplash in 2014.
Stone, who won the best actress prize at Venice for her La La Land role, previously starred with Gosling in Crazy, Stupid, Love.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that La La Land has won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about La La Land winning the top prize at Venice. Instead, it mentions that the film has enjoyed rave reviews since premiering at the festival.
3. The article does mention that La La Land has been well-received, but it does not specify that it has won any awards or prizes.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it claims that La La Land has won the top prize at Venice, which is not supported by the information in the article.
