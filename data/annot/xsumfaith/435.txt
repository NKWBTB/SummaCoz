</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna won the race, while the summary claims that the wife of one of the world's most famous competitors athletes is "shocked" by the lack of success in the sport.
2. The article does not mention anything about the wife of a famous competitor being shocked or disappointed by the lack of success in the sport. In fact, the article highlights the success of Richard and Anna in winning the race.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it introduces a new and unrelated claim about the wife of a famous competitor being shocked by the lack of success in the sport.
4. The inconsistency is likely due to the fact that the summary is not accurately summarizing the content of the article. The summary is introducing a new and unrelated claim that is not supported by the article.
