Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna beat Vytautas Kirkliauskas of Lithuania, carrying his wife, Neringa Kirliauskiene.
Rich said: "We put in a whole week's work, running around the athletics track near where we live - and it's paid off"
"We were pushed hard, especially by the Lithuanians there."
Competitors must tackle a 380-metre course, hurdling over haystacks, scrabbling up a steep slope, and dodging water pistols.
You don't need to be married to take part.
The race saw all combinations of competitors - men carrying women, men carrying men and one woman carrying a woman.
Rich and Anna will now compete at the World Championships in Finland in July. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna beat Vytautas Kirkliauskas of Lithuania, carrying his wife, Neringa Kirliauskiene. This means that Richard and Anna won the race with Neringa as their partner.
2. The summary states that the wife of one of the world's most famous competitors athletes has said she is "shocked" by the lack of success in the sport. However, there is no mention of any famous athletes or their wives in the article.
3. The article only mentions Richard and Anna, who are the winners of the race, and Neringa, who is Vytautas' wife and their partner in the race. There is no mention of any other famous athletes or their wives.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of any famous athletes or their wives in the article, and the summary implies that there is a famous athlete whose wife is shocked by the lack of success in the sport.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it introduces a fictional famous athlete and their wife, which is not present in the article.
