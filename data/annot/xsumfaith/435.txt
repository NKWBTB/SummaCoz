  "lack of success ",
  "the wife",
  "world\\'s most famous",

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "lack of success": The article does not mention anything about a lack of success in the sport. In fact, it highlights the success of Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna in winning the race. Therefore, this phrase is not supported by the article.
2. "she is ``shocked\'\'": The article does not mention the wife of any competitor expressing shock. In fact, the article quotes Richard Blake-Smith as saying that he and his partner put in a whole week's work to prepare for the race and that they were pushed hard by the Lithuanians. Therefore, this phrase is not supported by the article.
3. "lack of success": As mentioned earlier, the article does not mention a lack of success in the sport. Therefore, this phrase is not supported by the article.
4. "the wife": The article does not mention the wife of any competitor. The only mention of a wife is in the phrase "the wife of one of the world's most famous competitors," which is not supported by the article.
5. "world's most famous": The article does not mention anyone being famous or well-known. It simply reports on the results of the race. Therefore, this phrase is not supported by the article.
6. "wife": As mentioned earlier, the article does not mention the wife of any competitor. Therefore, this word is not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several phrases that are not supported by the information in the article.
