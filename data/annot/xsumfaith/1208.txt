    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Wayne Rooney played in Manchester United's match against Manchester United on Saturday. This is not possible, as there is no team called Manchester United that plays against itself.
2. The article does not mention anything about Wayne Rooney playing in a match against Manchester United. Instead, it talks about his testimonial game being streamed globally on Facebook.
3. The summary is not consistent with the article because it claims that Wayne Rooney played in a match against Manchester United, while the article only mentions his testimonial game being streamed on Facebook.
4. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.
