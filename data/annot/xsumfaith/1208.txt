Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the testimonial game will be played between Manchester United and Everton, which is Rooney's only two professional clubs.
2. The summary states that Rooney will play for Manchester United against Manchester United on Saturday. This is not possible as there is no team called Manchester United playing against Manchester United.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it incorrectly states that Rooney will play for Manchester United against Manchester United, when in fact, he will play for Everton against Manchester United.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Rooney will play for Manchester United against Manchester United on Saturday. This is not possible as Manchester United can not play against Manchester United themselves.
2. Instead, the article states that the testimonial game will be played between Rooney's only two professional clubs.
3. In addition, the article does not mention the date of the game is Saturday.
