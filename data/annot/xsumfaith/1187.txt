    Find out why.

    Summary:

    The incident occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness at about 14:00.
Several other people received minor injuries in the crash.
The road was closed and diversions were put in place via the A897 Helmsdale to Melvich road. Police Scotland said inquiries into the incident were ongoing. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the crash occurred on the A9 between Dumfries and Galloway, while the article states that the crash occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness. These two locations are not the same, and the summary is therefore not consistent with the article.

2. The summary mentions that the man died following the crash, while the article does not mention any fatalities. The article only states that several other people received minor injuries. This discrepancy indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.

3. The summary mentions that the road was closed and diversions were put in place, while the article does not mention anything about the road being closed or diversions being put in place. This absence of information in the article further supports the conclusion that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, based on these three points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and contains inaccuracies.
