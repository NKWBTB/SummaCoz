</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the incident occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness, while the summary states that the crash occurred on the A9 between Dumfries and Galloway. These two locations are not the same, and the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The article mentions that several other people received minor injuries in the crash, while the summary does not mention any injuries. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the information in the article.
3. The article states that the road was closed and diversions were put in place, while the summary does not mention any road closures or diversions. This inconsistency further suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies mentioned above, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and should not be relied upon as an accurate representation of the information in the article.
