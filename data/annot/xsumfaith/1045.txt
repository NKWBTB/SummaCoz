    Summary: 
    yorkshire\'s hopes of reaching the semi-finals of the one-day cup were dented by surrey\'s pace bowlers. 

    Article: 
    After being reduced to 8-2, they posted a score of 255-7, with Davies and Ben Foakes (90) sharing a stand of 130.
Yorkshire's run-chase was undermined by a three-wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker, whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance.
Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236.
Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi-finals last weekend, Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002.
They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs, the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover.
But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies, then on 43, off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary.
Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite, who took 3-48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes.
After losing Adam Lyth early, Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but fast bowler Meaker (3-61) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow (13), who lobbed tamely to mid-wicket, Ballance (32) and Jack Leaning.
Bresnan and Waite (38) did their best to repair the damage, but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long-off with seven balls remaining.
Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London:
"Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires, everybody's pulling together.
"Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent, that partnership blew the game wide open.
"The position we got ourselves to, I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270.
"But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs."
Yorkshire captain Alex Lees:
"We are all gutted. We have played some great white-ball cricket this season, but when it has mattered we haven't been good enough.
"The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target. We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Yorkshire's hopes of reaching the semi-finals were dented by Surrey's pace bowlers, but the article does not mention anything about Surrey's pace bowlers. Instead, it highlights the batting performances of Davies and Foakes, and the bowling of Meaker.
2. The summary mentions that Yorkshire were well-placed on 75-2, but the article states that they were reduced to 8-2. This is a significant difference and suggests that the summary is not accurately reflecting the content of the article.
3. The summary states that Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord's for the first time since 2002, but this is not mentioned in the article.
4. The summary mentions that Tim Bresnan made 68, but the article states that he was out for 38.
5. The summary states that Surrey skipper Gareth Batty said that the team is stepping up to the plate, but the article does not mention this quote.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important details. It appears to be a rushed or incomplete summary of the article's content.
