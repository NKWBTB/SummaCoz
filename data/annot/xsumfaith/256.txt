4. The article focuses on the seizure of alcohol and Viagra and the investigation of two distillers, but it does not mention any deaths or drugs that led to deaths.

5. The summary is not accurate because it includes information that is not present in the article.

6. The article is focused on the seizure of alcohol and Viagra and the investigation of two distillers, but the summary is focused on deaths, which are not present in the article.
