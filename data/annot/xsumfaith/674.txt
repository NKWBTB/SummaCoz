<Article>
Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation.
Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials.
"This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin.
"From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria.
"In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport.
Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations.
But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
"I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin.
"We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly.
"One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, but the Uefa executive rejected their application.
2. The article does not mention anything about Jersey appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
3. The summary states that Jersey are to appeal to the CAS after their bid to join Uefa was turned down.
4. This statement in the summary is not supported by the information in the article.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

The inconsistency lies in the fact that the article does not mention anything about Jersey appealing to the CAS, while the summary states that they are to do so. This indicates that the summary is not accurately representing the information in the article.
