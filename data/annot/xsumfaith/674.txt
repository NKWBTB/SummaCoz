    Summary: 
    jersey are to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport (cas) after their bid to join uefa was turned down. 

    Article: 
    Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid as the island is not recognised by the United Nations as an independent nation.
Representatives from Uefa visited the island, which is a crown dependency of Great Britain, in September to meet with Jersey football officials.
"This was the response we expected," said Jersey FA president Phil Austin.
"From a footballing perspective we more than meet the criteria.
"In rejecting our application, the executive of Uefa have said that they're not putting our application forward to the congress. We don't think the executive have the authority to do that, we think it should go to congress," Austin told BBC Sport.
Jersey submitted a bid to leave the English FA and join Uefa in December 2015, following the acceptance of Gibraltar and Kosovo, who are not independent nations.
But Gibraltar's initial application in 2007 came before the rules were changed, while Kosovo, who joined Uefa in May and played in their first World Cup qualifier in September declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
"I have no idea how long it's going to take, we are waiting for a court date hopefully within the next six months, but I don't know," added Austin.
"We are watching the costs very carefully and we will take it each step at a time and managed our budget accordingly.
"One or two people have stepped forward who believe in what we're doing and will help us with our funding." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Jersey is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after their bid to join UEFA was turned down.
2. However, the article states that Uefa's executive will not allow their congress to discuss Jersey's bid because the island is not recognized by the United Nations as an independent nation.
3. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of the United Nations or independence in the summary.
4. The article explains that Uefa's executive rejected Jersey's application because the island is not recognized as an independent nation by the United Nations.
5. The summary does not provide any information about why Uefa rejected Jersey's bid, and instead states that Jersey is appealing to CAS.
6. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information or context as the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same information or context as the article. The article provides the reason why Uefa rejected Jersey's bid, which is not mentioned in the summary.
