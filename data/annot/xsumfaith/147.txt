    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the world's newest generation of robots are changing, which is not entirely accurate. The article does not focus solely on the latest generation of robots, but rather explores how our relationship with robots is changing in various aspects of our lives.
2. The summary implies that the change in robots is a recent development, while the article actually covers a broader scope of how our relationship with robots has evolved over time.
3. The summary does not mention the aspect of the article that explores the changing relationship between humans and robots, such as how we work, play, and live with them.
4. The summary does not provide any specific examples or details from the article, which suggests that it was not written based on the content of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content or scope of the article. The article explores a broader range of topics related to our relationship with robots, while the summary focuses solely on the latest generation of robots.
