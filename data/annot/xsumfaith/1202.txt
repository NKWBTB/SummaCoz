    Summary: 
    the lib dems have rejected calls by the liberal democrats to set up a brexit deal with the eu. 

    Article: 
    Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to "concede everything", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people "false hope".
The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.
But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons.
A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was "fairly obvious grandstanding" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.
"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government," the source said.
For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of "waving through the government's plans" and "lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit".
It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.
Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: "The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on."
But the Labour source predicted "residual tensions", adding: "I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering.
"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Lib Dems have rejected calls by the Labour Party to set up a Brexit deal with the EU.

This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that the Lib Dems and Labour have teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government regarding Brexit.

2. The summary implies that the Lib Dems are opposed to setting up a Brexit deal with the EU, while the article states that the Lib Dems are determined to insist on certain amendments regarding Brexit.

3. The summary suggests that the Lib Dems are grandstanding and building up false hope for the public, while the article states that the Labour source in the Lords views the Lib Dems' actions as "fairly obvious grandstanding" and "geared towards content for their campaign leaflets."

4. The summary does not mention the fact that the Lib Dems and Labour have worked together in the past to defeat the government on other issues, as stated in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be biased against the Lib Dems.
