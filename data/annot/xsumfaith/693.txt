Find out why.

<Article>
Seven firms, including major supermarkets such as NTUC FairPrice and IKEA, have been asked declare they are not doing so within a week.
The forest fires in Indonesia have deteriorated Singapore's air quality, causing a blanket of haze in the city.
FairPrice has said it removing products from one Indonesian firm.
The state-owned supermarket giant said that it was removing all paper products sourced from Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the notification from the government.
APP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze.
What is behind the South East Asia haze?
In a joint statement, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have "not procured or used wood, paper and/or pulp materials" from firms accused of contributing to the fires.
The SEC said retailers were "a good starting point" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and "for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices"
The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region. It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month, in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia.
Anger has been rising in the region, with increasing pressure on the Indonesian government to control the annual burning of forests to clear land for palm oil and rubber plantations.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Singapore government has asked retailers to declare that they have not procured or used wood, paper, and/or pulp materials from firms accused of contributing to the forest fires in Indonesia.
2. The summary states that Singapore is putting pressure on major retailers in Singapore to not use or sell materials produced by firms linked to fires in Indonesia.
3. The word "putting pressure" in the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention any pressure being put on retailers. Instead, the article states that the government has asked retailers to declare their procurement practices.
4. The article does mention that the government has named certain companies, including Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), as being suspected of contributing to the haze, but it does not mention any pressure being put on retailers to stop using or selling their products.
5. Therefore, the phrase "putting pressure" in the summary is not supported by the information in the article, and is inconsistent with the content of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (i.e., the phrase "putting pressure" on retailers). To make the summary consistent with the article, the phrase "putting pressure" should be removed, and the summary should focus on the fact that the government has asked retailers to declare their procurement practices.
