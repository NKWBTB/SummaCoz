</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "wind turbine was spotted off the coast",
  "hundreds of people have been warned to expect disruption after a wind turbine was spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire",
  "hundreds"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "wind turbine was spotted off the coast": The article does not mention anything about a wind turbine being spotted off the coast. Instead, it mentions that the yellow warning of wind is for gusts of up to 75mph (120kmph) could occur locally, particularly to the west of the mountains.
2. "hundreds of people have been warned to expect disruption after a wind turbine was spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire": This statement is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of a wind turbine being spotted off the coast of Pembrokeshire in the article. Additionally, the article only mentions that disruption to travel on roads and at sea is likely, but it does not mention anything about hundreds of people being warned to expect disruption.
3. "hundreds": The article does not mention the word "hundreds" at all. It only mentions that disruption to travel on roads and at sea is likely.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and it exaggerates the impact of the wind warning.
