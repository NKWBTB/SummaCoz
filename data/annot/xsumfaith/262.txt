Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "gusts of up to 75mph (120kmph) could occur locally, particularly to the west of the mountains." However, the summary mentions nothing about wind turbines or gusts of that speed.
2. The article specifically mentions the affected counties as Conwy, Anglesey, Gwynedd, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, and Powys. The summary does not mention any of these counties.
3. The article states that disruption to travel on roads and at sea is likely due to the winds. The summary mentions nothing about disruption to travel.
4. The article mentions that a tree was brought down in Menai Bridge on Anglesey due to overnight gusts, and that the road was expected to remain closed for most of Monday. The summary does not mention any of this information.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary incorrectly mentions a wind turbine being spotted off the coast of Pembrokeshire, which is not mentioned in the article at all. Additionally, the summary fails to mention the affected counties, the potential for disruption to travel, and the specific details about the tree being brought down in Menai Bridge.
