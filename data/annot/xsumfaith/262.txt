    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions "hundreds of people have been warned to expect disruption" due to a wind turbine off the coast of Pembrokeshire.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a wind turbine. Instead, it talks about a yellow warning of wind, gusts of up to 75mph, and disruption to travel on roads and at sea.
3. The article does mention that the winds are coming from an unusual easterly direction, but there is no mention of a wind turbine.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a wind turbine, which is not mentioned in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is because it includes information that is not present in the article, specifically the mention of a wind turbine.
