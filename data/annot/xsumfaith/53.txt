    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the police have arrested a man in connection with the rape and murder of a German woman. However, the article states that the man who was arrested is the victim's ex-partner, not the perpetrator.
2. The summary does not mention the victim's ex-partner being arrested, which is a significant detail that is present in the article.
3. The article states that the victim was found lying on a pavement with serious injuries and was flown to a specialist clinic, but the summary does not mention the victim's injuries or their condition.
4. The article mentions that the suspect is 38 years old and from Bad Muender, but the summary does not include this information.
5. The article states that the motive for the attack is not yet clear, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include several important details that are present in the article, such as the victim's ex-partner being arrested, the victim's injuries, and the suspect's identity and location. Additionally, the summary mentions the rape and murder of the victim, but the article only mentions the victim being found with serious injuries and does not specify the cause of those injuries.
