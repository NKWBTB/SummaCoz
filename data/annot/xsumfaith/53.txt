</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the police have arrested a man in connection with the rape and murder of a German woman.
2. However, the article does not mention the word "rape" or "murder" at all.
3. The article only states that the woman was found lying on the pavement with serious injuries and was flown to a specialist clinic.
4. The article also mentions that the suspect is in custody, but it does not specify the nature of the crime or the suspect's relationship to the victim.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (rape and murder) and omits other important details (such as the fact that the suspect is the victim's ex-partner and the motive for the attack is not yet clear).
