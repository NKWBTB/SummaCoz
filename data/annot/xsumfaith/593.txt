     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary asks about remembering news in Wales over the past 12 months, while the article is a news quiz that focuses on events from July 2016, which is not related to Wales.
2. The summary does not mention anything about a news quiz or testing knowledge, while the article is clearly a quiz.
3. The summary is written in a way that suggests it is asking for memories of past events, while the article is focused on testing current knowledge of news events from a specific time period.

Overall, the summary and article are not consistent because they are focused on different topics and have different purposes. The summary is asking about memories of past events in Wales, while the article is a news quiz that tests knowledge of events from a specific time period.
