<Article>
Craig Hughes, 33, of Flint, was arrested by North Wales Police in August after he chatted online with the Hope Line Crisis Centre in Tennessee.
Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non-existent crime.
Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday.
He will be sentenced next week.
Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene, prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings.
He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary.
The threats were made on two occasions, late at night, while Hughes was drunk.
Judge Niclas Parry, who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009, remanded him in custody pending sentence.
During a previous hearing, Hughes's legal team said he had not intended to kill himself and would not have carried out any threat to kill police officers.
The court heard at the time, North Wales Police was particularly concerned because the defendant was on bail, awaiting trial for firearms offences, of which he was subsequently cleared.
The Hope Line centre offers confidential support and counselling to people experiencing difficulty.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "a man has pleaded guilty to a string of offences relating to the prosecution of a man at the dee estuary in flintshire"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Craig Hughes was arrested for making threats against the police, specifically planning to shoot them on the Dee Estuary while they were responding to a false report.
2. The summary states that Craig Hughes has pleaded guilty to a string of offences relating to the prosecution of a man at the Dee Estuary in Flintshire.
3. The article does not mention anything about a man being prosecuted at the Dee Estuary. Instead, it focuses on Hughes' threats against the police.
4. Therefore, the phrase "a man at the Dee Estuary" in the summary is not supported by the article.
5. Additionally, the word "prosecution" in the summary is also not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of any prosecution taking place.
6. Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article.

I hope that helps clarify the consistency issues in the summary!
