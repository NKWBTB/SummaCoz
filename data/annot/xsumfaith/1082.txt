    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the snp has hit back at twitter after tweeting that she\'s not doing enough to protect her from abusive behaviour. 

    Article: 
    Their comments, she wrote, "reminds me how big the world is and how many more decent people there are than not".
The Harry Potter author previously tweeted that her "personal line [had] been crossed" by some abusive comments.
"It isn't always fun being a famous woman on Twitter and I believe in standing up to bullies," she wrote.
Rowling faced a flood of criticism on Twitter last year after it emerged she had donated Â£1m to the campaign for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum.
In 2008, she donated the same amount to the Labour party.
On Friday the author revealed she had been called "a traitor" for her political views and had blocked some abusive Twitter users she believed had been supporters of the Scottish National Party (SNP).
"I feel no responsibility to hush up that kind of behaviour to protect the image of any political party," she told one Twitter user.
The 49-year-old also revealed she had "responded to other really nice SNP supporters" and had discussed "how much I had in common politically with many of them".
The writer also joked she would "bring marshmallows" after a Twitter user suggested her books should be burned in public.
The SNP took 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland in Thursday's election and is now the third largest party in the UK. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the SNP has "hit back" at J.K. Rowling, but the article does not mention the SNP responding to Rowling at all. The article only mentions Rowling's own responses to abusive tweets.
2. The summary implies that Rowling is upset about the SNP's behavior, but the article states that she believes in standing up to bullies and has blocked some abusive Twitter users. This suggests that she is not upset about the SNP's behavior, but rather taking action to protect herself from abuse.
3. The summary mentions that Rowling "hit back" at the SNP, but the article does not mention her doing so. Instead, the article states that she has blocked some abusive Twitter users and responded to other nice SNP supporters. This suggests that she is not actively "hitting back" at the SNP, but rather taking steps to protect herself from abuse and engaging with some of her political supporters.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the SNP has responded to Rowling, that she is upset about their behavior, and that she is actively "hitting back" at them. However, the article does not support these claims and instead portrays Rowling as taking steps to protect herself from abuse and engaging with some of her political supporters.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the SNP has hit back at twitter, but the article does not mention the SNP responding on twitter at all. The article only mentions the Harry Potter author's own responses to abusive tweets.
2. The summary state that "she's not doing enough to protect her from abusive behaviour". However, the article does not mention anything about "not doing enough".
