    Summary: 
    children in the uk are being urged to avoid bullying in the past year, according to new figures. 

    Article: 
    The NSPCC's Childline service said it counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12.
The total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher.
Some children as young as seven told Childline how they were tormented, abused and scared to go to school.
The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children.
Childline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call.
"Bullying can wreck young people's lives, especially now that the bullies don't stop at the school gates," she said.
"Cyber-bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape.
"It is imperative that adults, parents and teachers, intervene to protect them, because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own, left alone it gets worse.
"Schools must take this problem seriously, and above all children must ask for help."
The report is being released at the start of Anti-Bullying Week which is coordinated by the Anti Bullying Alliance.
The group is working with parents, schools and other organisations to help combat the problem.
One young person who contacted Childline said: "It might sound like not much of a problem but there's a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself. I won't kill myself but it upsets me.
"My parents don't realise how upset it's making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don't know how hard that is.
"I don't know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much."

     The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary states that children in the UK are being urged to avoid bullying, but the article does not mention any urging or encouragement of children to avoid bullying. Instead, the article focuses on the increase in bullying and online abuse that Childline has counseled children about, and the impact it has on their lives. The article also highlights the need for adults, parents, and teachers to intervene and take the problem seriously.

Here are some specific reasons why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary does not mention the increase in bullying and online abuse that the article highlights.
2. The summary does not mention the impact of bullying on children's lives, as described in the article.
3. The summary does not mention the need for adults, parents, and teachers to intervene and take the problem seriously, as emphasized in the article.
4. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, which focuses on the issue of bullying and online abuse, rather than urging children to avoid it.
