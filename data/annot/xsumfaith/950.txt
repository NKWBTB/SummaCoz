The NSPCC's Childline service said it counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12.
The total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher.
Some children as young as seven told Childline how they were tormented, abused and scared to go to school.
The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children.
Childline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call.
"Bullying can wreck young people's lives, especially now that the bullies don't stop at the school gates," she said.
"Cyber-bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape.
"It is imperative that adults, parents and teachers, intervene to protect them, because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own, left alone it gets worse.
"Schools must take this problem seriously, and above all children must ask for help."
The report is being released at the start of Anti-Bullying Week which is coordinated by the Anti Bullying Alliance.
The group is working with parents, schools and other organisations to help combat the problem.
One young person who contacted Childline said: "It might sound like not much of a problem but there's a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself. I won't kill myself but it upsets me.
"My parents don't realise how upset it's making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don't know how hard that is.
"I don't know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Childline counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year, compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12. This suggests that the number of children experiencing bullying has increased.
2. The article also states that online trolls are causing misery and humiliation for thousands of children. This indicates that the bullying is taking place online, and that it is having a significant impact on the children involved.
3. The article quotes Dame Esther Rantzen as saying that bullying can wreck young people's lives and that it is imperative that adults, parents, and teachers intervene to protect them. This suggests that the issue of bullying is a serious one and that it requires action from adults to address it.
4. The article also includes a quote from a young person who contacted Childline, stating that they were told to kill themselves by a group of people they played with online. This highlights the severity of the bullying that some children are experiencing and the impact it can have on their well-being.
5. The summary states that children in the UK are being urged to avoid bullying in the past year, according to new figures. However, the article does not mention any figures or evidence of children being urged to avoid bullying. Instead, it focuses on the increasing number of children experiencing bullying and the need for adults to take action to address the issue.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article focuses on the serious issue of bullying and the need for adults to intervene to protect children, while the summary suggests that children are being urged to avoid bullying, which is not supported by the article.
