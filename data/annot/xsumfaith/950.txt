<Article>
The NSPCC's Childline service said it counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12.
The total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher.
Some children as young as seven told Childline how they were tormented, abused and scared to go to school.
The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children.
Childline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call.
"Bullying can wreck young people's lives, especially now that the bullies don't stop at the school gates," she said.
"Cyber-bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape.
"It is imperative that adults, parents and teachers, intervene to protect them, because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own, left alone it gets worse.
"Schools must take this problem seriously, and above all children must ask for help."
The report is being released at the start of Anti-Bullying Week which is coordinated by the Anti Bullying Alliance.
The group is working with parents, schools and other organisations to help combat the problem.
One young person who contacted Childline said: "It might sound like not much of a problem but there's a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself. I won't kill myself but it upsets me.
"My parents don't realise how upset it's making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don't know how hard that is.
"I don't know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "new figures": The article does mention that the NSPCC's Childline service counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year, but it does not mention any "new figures." The figures mentioned in the article are from the previous year (2011-12) and the current year (2018-19). Therefore, the phrase "new figures" is not accurate.
2. "uk": The article does not mention anything about the UK specifically. The Childline service counselled children from all over the country, and the article does not provide any information about the geographical location of the children who were counselled. Therefore, the phrase "uk" is not relevant to the article.
3. "past year": The article mentions that the Childline service counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year (2018-19), but it does not provide any information about the previous year (2011-12). Therefore, the phrase "past year" is not accurate.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article. The summary should be revised to accurately represent the content of the article.
