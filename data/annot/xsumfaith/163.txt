    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    more than 10, 000 journeys could be made by a rail link between england and the uk over the next 30 years, a study has found. 

    Article: 
    The report focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK.
The line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms.
Network Rail said the study would be "key" to long-term developments.
The report, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, said that 10% of journeys on the line, which was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014, could be affected by 2040.
The report said adverse weather disrupted the line about 10 days per year, but according to sea-level predictions that could rise to almost 40 by 2040 and up to 120 by 2100.
Academics from Plymouth University, the University of Leeds and the University of York identified a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years.
The academics said there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales, south-east England, the Cumbrian coast and Scotland.
Dr David Dawson, from the University of Leeds, said the long-term future of the line was "really worrying".
The report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds.
Network Rail said it hoped to develop "long-term interventions" to "secure the future" of the line.
The Department for Transport said it had invested Â£31m into improving the resilience of the route and was "exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area".
In January, the prime minister backed a new Okehampton railway route as the "most resilient" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that more than 10,000 journeys could be made by a rail link between England and the UK over the next 30 years. However, the article does not mention anything about the number of journeys or the potential for rail links between England and the UK.
2. The article focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line, which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK. The article mentions that the line was closed for two months in 2014 due to storm damage and that adverse weather could disrupt the line up to 120 days per year by 2100.
3. The article does not mention anything about the long-term future of the line or the potential for diverting routes. Instead, it focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the existing line and the potential for similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout the UK.
4. The summary states that the report found that 10% of journeys on the line could be affected by 2040, but the article does not provide any information about the percentage of journeys that could be affected or the potential for rail links between England and the UK.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the summary mentions the potential for rail links between England and the UK, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary provides a specific number (10,000) for the number of journeys that could be made, which is not supported by the article.
