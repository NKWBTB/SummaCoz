    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Simon Stevens is to play the "beauty of the beauty and the beast." However, the article does not mention anything about Simon Stevens being cast in the film.
2. The article only mentions the cast for the main characters: Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as the Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, and Josh Gad as LeFou. There is no mention of Simon Stevens.
3. The article does mention that the film will begin filming at Shepperton Studios in May, but there is no mention of Simon Stevens being involved in the project.
4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, and there is no evidence to suggest that Simon Stevens is involved in the film.
