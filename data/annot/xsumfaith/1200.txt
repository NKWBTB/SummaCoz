A statement from Rockstar said: "The game requires a few extra weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as can be."
"Moving a release date is never a decision we take lightly and is a choice we make only when we know it is in the best interests of the game and our fans.
"Thanks everyone for your understanding and we assure you these few extra weeks will be worth it when the game does arrive in March."
It's not all bad news though. The company announced that eagerly-awaited online heists are coming to consoles before the PC release date.

While you're waiting for the game to be released you can make sure your PC is up to scratch.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Based on the provided article and summary, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The article is about the delay of the release of Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), while the summary mentions "vlogtarter" releasing details of its latest version. There is no mention of GTA V in the summary.
2. The article is written in a formal tone and is about a well-known video game, while the summary is written in an informal tone and refers to a fictional product called "vlogtarter."
3. The article is published by the BBC, a reputable news source, while the summary is not attributed to any specific source or publication.
4. The article provides specific details about the delay of GTA V, such as the new release date and the reason for the delay, while the summary does not provide any specific information about the product it is referring to.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. It appears to be a fictional or misleading summary that is not related to the actual content of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that vlogtarter has released details of its latest version of rocks.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about vlogstarter nor rocks.
3. Instead, the article is about the delay of the release of Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) from Rockstar.
