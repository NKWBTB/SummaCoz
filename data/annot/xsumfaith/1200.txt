3. Screenshots: The summary does not mention any screenshots, but the article states that screenshots from the PC version of GTA V have been released, with Rockstar promising "even greater levels of detail".
4. Resolution: The summary does not mention anything about resolution, but the article states that Los Santos and Blaine County will be visible in 1080p at 60fps, with up to 4K resolution and support for up to triple monitor configurations.
