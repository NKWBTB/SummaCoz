<Article>
Clarkson, 30, joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
He scored nine goals at Dundee last season and has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term.
"I'm ready, I've been fit all season and I'm as fit as I've ever been," Clarkson told the St Mirren website.
"I've been playing games, playing for the U20s and I like to keep my match fitness up.
"I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit and hopefully up to speed with everyone else really. I'm looking forward to getting started."
Capped twice for Scotland in 2008 and with one international goal to his name, Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level.
His previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.
St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa.
"Obviously the game on Saturday, every game is a big game, and the more games we can win the more confidence we can get from that we can hopefully go on a run of games and push up the table and try to get the club back to where it has been," added Clarkson.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, but the summary claims that Bristol Rovers signed him on loan from Brentford. These two statements are contradictory, as Premiership Well and Brentford are different teams.
2. The article mentions that Clarkson has been featuring mainly as a substitute this season, but the summary implies that he has joined Bristol Rovers as a permanent signing.
3. The article quotes Clarkson as saying that he is ready to play and has been training hard, but the summary does not mention any of this context.
4. The article provides information about Clarkson's previous teams, including Bristol City, Brentford, and Premiership Well, but the summary does not mention any of these teams.
5. The article mentions that St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, but the summary does not provide any information about the team or the league.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is incorrect in its statement that Bristol Rovers signed Clarkson on loan from Brentford, as the article states that he joined Premiership Well for a second spell. Additionally, the summary does not provide any context or information about Clarkson's previous teams or his current situation with St Mirren.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Bristol Rovers have signed striker Jeremy Clarkson on loan from Brentford.
2. However, the article does not mention Clarkson's first name is Jeremy.
3. The article also does not mention a player loan deal between Bristol Rovers and Brentford.
