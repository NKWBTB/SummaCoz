    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ayr United scored two late goals to beat Ayr United. This is incorrect, as the article states that Ayr United scored two quick fire goals to take control of the game.
2. The summary does not mention the name of the team that scored the goals. The article states that El Bakhtaoui and Paton scored for the visitors, but the summary does not include this information.
3. The summary mentions a late chance for Ayr United, which is not consistent with the article. The article states that Craig Moore fired a late chance over the bar, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events described in the article.
