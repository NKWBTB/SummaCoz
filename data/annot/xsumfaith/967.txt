Rich said: "We put in a whole week's work, running around the athletics track near where we live - and it's paid off"
"We were pushed hard, especially by the Lithuanians there."
Competitors must tackle a 380-metre course, hurdling over haystacks, scrabbling up a steep slope, and dodging water pistols.
You don't need to be married to take part.
The race saw all combinations of competitors - men carrying women, men carrying men and one woman carrying a woman.
Rich and Anna will now compete at the World Championships in Finland in July. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that the race was a 380-meter course with obstacles such as haystacks, steep slopes, and water pistols.

    2. The summary claims that the race was part of the world's Olympic Games, which is not supported by the article.

    3. The article mentions that the race was held near the competitors' home, but the summary does not mention this detail.

    4. The article states that all combinations of competitors were allowed, including men carrying women, men carrying men, and one woman carrying a woman. The summary does not mention this detail.

    5. The article mentions that the winners, Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna, will compete at the World Championships in Finland in July, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Includes a detail that is not present in the article (the race being part of the Olympic Games)
* Omits other important details present in the article (the location of the race, the obstacles, and the fact that all combinations of competitors were allowed)
* Mentions a future event that is not mentioned in the article (the World Championships in Finland)
