Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna beat Vytautas Kirkliauskas of Lithuania, carrying his wife, Neringa Kirliauskiene.
Rich said: "We put in a whole week's work, running around the athletics track near where we live - and it's paid off"
"We were pushed hard, especially by the Lithuanians there."
Competitors must tackle a 380-metre course, hurdling over haystacks, scrabbling up a steep slope, and dodging water pistols.
You don't need to be married to take part.
The race saw all combinations of competitors - men carrying women, men carrying men and one woman carrying a woman.
Rich and Anna will now compete at the World Championships in Finland in July. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that there is a winner of the UK Wife Carrying Championships, but the article does not mention a winner. Instead, it talks about Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna beating Vytautas Kirkliauskas of Lithuania.
2. The summary implies that the competition was only for married couples, but the article states that competitors can be any combination of men and women, and that there were men carrying men, women carrying women, and men carrying women.
3. The summary mentions a winner, but the article does not provide any information about the winner. Instead, it focuses on the competition and the participants.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes claims that are not supported by the information in the article.
