    Find out why.

A post-mortem found the 34-year-old from Wath-Upon-Dearn in Rotherham died as a result of head injuries.
A man, 41, and a woman, 23, were arrested in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police and remain in custody. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the police arrested two people on suspicion of murder, but the article does not mention anything about the police arresting anyone. Instead, it states that a man and a woman were taken into custody, but it does not specify the reason for their arrest.
2. The summary mentions that the body was found on moorland, but the article states that the body was found at the Woodhead Tunnels off the A628 in Derbyshire.
3. The summary states that the victim was 34 years old, but the article does not mention the victim's age.
4. The summary states that the victim died as a result of head injuries, but the article only states that the cause of death is not yet known.

Therefore, based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
