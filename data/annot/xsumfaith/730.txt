Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the body was found at the Woodhead Tunnels off the A628 in Derbyshire, which is not a moorland area. Moorlands are typically characterized by open, rugged, and hilly landscapes, which is not descriptive of the location where the body was found.
2. The summary mentions "moorland," which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention the word "moorland" at all.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the reference to "moorland" is not accurate and does not match the location where the body was found, as described in the article.
