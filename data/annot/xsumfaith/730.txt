</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the body of Craig Nelson was found at the Woodhead Tunnels off the A628 in Derbyshire, while the summary only mentions "moorland". The Woodhead Tunnels are not located on moorland, so the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The article states that Craig Nelson died as a result of head injuries, while the summary does not mention any specific cause of death. The summary only mentions "murder", which is not supported by the article.
3. The article states that two people, a man and a woman, were arrested in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police, while the summary does not mention anything about the arrests or the identity of the suspects.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary only mentions a few general details, such as the location of the body and the suspicion of murder, but it does not provide any specific information that is supported by the article.
