In 2008, about 40 were recorded on the seahorse study site at South Beach in the bay, but none have been spotted there since 2013.
Miranda Krestovnikoff has been investigating for Inside Out and speaking to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, and the Royal Yachting Association's Emma Barton. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that no seahorses have been spotted at South Beach in the bay since 2013.
2. The summary states that an updated bay has been spotted at a beach in south south England.
3. These two statements are contradictory, as the article states that no seahorses have been spotted at South Beach since 2013, while the summary states that an updated bay has been spotted.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains incorrect information about the presence of seahorses at South Beach.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains false information about the presence of seahorses at South Beach. The article states that no seahorses have been spotted there since 2013, while the summary states that an updated bay has been spotted.
