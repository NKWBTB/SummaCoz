Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "none have been spotted there since 2013" which means that there have been no sightings of seahorses at the South Beach study site since 2013.
2. The summary states that "a updated bay has been spotted at a beach in south south england" which implies that there have been recent sightings of seahorses at a beach in south England.
3. The article and the summary have conflicting information, as the article states that there have been no sightings of seahorses at the study site since 2013, while the summary states that there have been recent sightings of seahorses at a beach in south England.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it provides information that is not supported by the article.
