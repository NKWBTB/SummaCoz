Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Manchester City have been charged with violent conduct during their match against Chelsea, but the summary claims that the club has been given a one-match touchline ban.
2. The article mentions that Sergio Aguero and Fernandinho were sent off for violent conduct, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article states that Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that Pep Guardiola apologized for his team's part in the incident, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the charges brought against Manchester City and the reasons for those charges. The summary omits important details and presents a misleading picture of the situation.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Manchester City defeated by Chelsea 2-0.
2. However, the article states that Chelsea won 3-1.
3. The summary states that Manchester city have been given a one-match touchline ban by the football association.
4. However, the article does not mention any ban on the club. The article only mentions Aguero received a four-match ban and Fernandinho will serve a three-match ban.
