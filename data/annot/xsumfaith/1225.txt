<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    manchester city have been given a one-match touchline ban by the football association for violent conduct during their 2-0 defeat by chelsea. 

    Article: 
    The charge follows the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1.
City had forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho sent off, but Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action.
City manager Pep Guardiola apologised for his team's part in the incident.
Aguero, 28, received a four-match ban for what was his second dismissal for violent conduct this season, following a high and late challenge on Chelsea defender David Luiz.
Fernandinho clashed with Fabregas in the scuffle that followed Aguero's challenge, and the Brazil midfielder will serve a three-match ban.
Both clubs have until 18:00 GMT on 8 December to respond to the charge. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Manchester City has been given a one-match touchline ban, but the article does not mention anything about a touchline ban.
2. The summary mentions violent conduct during the game, but the article only mentions a mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game.
3. The summary states that Sergio Aguero and Fernandinho were sent off, but the article only mentions that Aguero received a four-match ban and Fernandinho will serve a three-match ban.
4. The summary does not mention Cesc Fabregas, but the article states that he will not face any further action.
5. The summary mentions Pep Guardiola apologizing for his team's part in the incident, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reasons for inconsistency are:

* The summary mentions a touchline ban, but the article does not mention it.
* The summary does not accurately describe the nature of the incident, as the article only mentions a mass fracas and does not use the term "violent conduct."
* The summary does not accurately describe the punishments given to the players, as the article mentions different lengths of bans for Aguero and Fernandinho.
* The summary does not mention Cesc Fabregas, who is mentioned in the article.
* The summary includes information that is not in the article (Pep Guardiola apologizing for his team's part in the incident).
