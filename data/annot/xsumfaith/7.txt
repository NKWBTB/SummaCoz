    Summary: 
    ipswich town ended qpr\'s seven-game winning run in the championship with a comfortable win at carrow road. 

    Article: 
    Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance.
Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner.
Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on.
Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies.
The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge.
The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three.
"With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team.
"We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been."
QPR boss Ian Holloway:  "I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have.
"The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five.
"Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him.
"My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team."

1. The summary states that Ipswich Town ended QPR's seven-game winning run, but the article does not mention anything about QPR's winning run.
2. The summary mentions that Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net, but the article states that Alex Smithies miscued a clearance and Varney headed the ball into the net.
3. The summary does not mention the goal scored by Cole Skuse, which is described in detail in the article.
4. The summary states that QPR offered little in attack, but the article mentions that QPR had a few chances, including a header against the post by Sandro.
5. The summary quotes Mick McCarthy as saying that the irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal, but the article does not mention McCarthy saying this.
6. The summary quotes Ian Holloway as saying that everyone will blame his keeper, but the article does not mention Holloway saying this.

Overall, the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content. It omits or misrepresents several key details and quotes, and does not provide an accurate summary of the match.
