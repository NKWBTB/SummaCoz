    Summary: 
    swedish foreign minister johan gusttrom has been freed after two suspected kidnappings in a raid in mali, his foreign ministry says. 

    Article: 
    Mr Gustafsson, 42, is being flown back to Sweden from Africa, Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallström said in a statement on Monday.
He was seized by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) along with two other men, one of whom was freed in a dawn raid in 2015.
Ms Wallström said Mr Gustafsson was "in good spirits", local media report.
"It is with great pleasure that I can announce that Johan Gustafsson has been released," Ms Wallström added.
She said that the Swede's release was thanks to "extensive efforts" and co-operation between the Swedish foreign ministry, police and "foreign authorities".
Ms Wallström said she had spoken with Mr Gustafsson, who she described as being "happy" and "overwhelmed" by Monday's events.
"I cannot say more at the current time," she added.
Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that Mr Gustafsson's kidnapping weighed heavily on his mind during his time in the role, which ended in 2014.
He tweeted on Monday: "Extremely gratifying that Johan Gustafsson is free. No single case concerned me more as foreign minister."
Mr Gustafsson was kidnapped along with South African Stephen McGown and Dutchman Sjaak Rijke.
Mr Rijke was freed by French special forces in April 2015 after he was discovered by chance in a dawn raid in northern Mali.
AQIM took a number of Western hostages before the French military deployed its forces in January 2013.
In a separate incident in December 2014, French hostage Serge Lazarevic was freed after a prisoner swap. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Swedish Foreign Minister Johan Gustafsson has been freed after two suspected kidnappings in a raid in Mali.

However, the article does not mention anything about two suspected kidnappings. Instead, it states that Mr. Gustafsson was kidnapped along with two other men, and that one of them was freed in a dawn raid in 2015.

2. The summary states that Mr. Gustafsson was freed in a raid, but the article does not mention any raid. Instead, it states that Mr. Gustafsson was freed "thanks to extensive efforts and co-operation between the Swedish foreign ministry, police and foreign authorities."

3. The summary states that Mr. Gustafsson is being flown back to Sweden from Africa, but the article does not mention anything about him being flown back to Sweden. Instead, it states that he is being freed and that Ms. Wallström has spoken with him.

4. The summary states that Ms. Wallström said Mr. Gustafsson was "in good spirits", but the article does not mention anything about his spirits. Instead, it states that she described him as "happy" and "overwhelmed" by Monday's events.

5. The summary states that Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt tweeted that Mr. Gustafsson's kidnapping weighed heavily on his mind during his time in the role, but the article does not mention anything about Mr. Bildt or his tweet.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states mentions "Swedish Foreign Minister Johan Gusttrom". However, the article does not mention a person named "gusttrom". In the article, Margot Wallström is the Swedish Foreign Miniter.
2. The summary states that Johan Gusttrom has been freed after two suspected kidnappings in a raid in Mali. However, the article does not mention anything about two suspected kidnappings. Instead, it states that Mr. Gustafsson was kidnapped along with two other men, and that one of them was freed in a dawn raid in 2015.
