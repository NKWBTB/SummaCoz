<Article>
The fight, Adams' second as a professional and first in her home city for 20 years, will be over four three-minute rounds, rather than the usual two-minute rounds for women.
The flyweight voiced her frustration with two-minute rounds after beating Virginia Carcamo last month.
Salazar, 18, has lost once in six professional contests.
Adams, 34, says the extra minute in each round will give her a chance to try out things she has learnt in the gym.
She said: "I had two minutes to find my rhythm, distance and take out my opponent. It's not enough time.
"I found, by the end of the rounds, I needed a couple more seconds and it would be over.
"Now we have three minutes, I'm able to relax more, establish the jab, find the rhythm properly and really get in the swing of things."
On the same card, WBC international featherweight champion Josh Warrington defends his title against Spain's Kiko Martinez.

  "leeds on saturday",
  "mexico\\'s maryan",
  "britain\\'s double olympic champion nicola"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "Leeds on Saturday" - The article does not mention the location of the fight, only that it will be over four three-minute rounds. The summary incorrectly states that the fight will take place in Leeds on Saturday.
2. "Mexico's Maryan" - The article does not mention Maryan's nationality. The summary incorrectly adds "Mexico's" before Maryan's name.
3. "Britain's double Olympic champion Nicola" - The article does not mention Nicola's achievements or titles. The summary incorrectly adds "Britain's double Olympic champion" before Nicola's name.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article. The correct summary should only include information that is directly quoted or explicitly stated in the article.
