<Article>
Discovered on land at North Elmham, near Dereham, the circa 600 AD coin was created by French rulers of the time to increase their available currency.
Adrian Marsden, finds officer based at Norwich Castle Museum, said the object was probably buried with its owner.
The pendant was declared treasure by the Norfolk coroner on Wednesday.
Mr Marsden added: "This is an early copy of a Byzantine gold coin made in France.
"The Merovingians [French rulers] created copies of Byzantine coins from their bullion as there wasn't enough coinage coming in from the eastern Roman empire. How many of these copies were 'official' currency is hard to say."
The 23.5mm diameter pendant, created from an imitation of a gold solidus of emperor Maurice Tiberius (582-602 AD), features a suspension loop with three longitudinal ribs having been soldered to the edge of the coin immediately above the emperor's head.
"What's interesting is you have somebody in France copying a Byzantine coin which then also followed the trend of turning it into jewellery."
Mr Marsden said the coin was likely to have come to England as a result of export trade at the time.
"We see very few of these so it's an interesting find and one that we will hope to acquire for the Norwich Castle Museum collection."
Other items declared treasure at the coroner's inquest include an early-medieval Carolingian-style silver mount found in Barnham Broom, a hoard of 150 Roman coins discovered in Quidenham and an early-medieval biconical gold bead which would have been worn on high-status necklaces.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the coin was discovered in Norfolk, while the summary states that the coin is from the 18th century, which is not consistent with the article.
2. The article describes the coin as being from the 600 AD period, while the summary states that the coin is from the 18th century, which is not consistent with the article.
3. The article mentions that the coin was created by French rulers, while the summary does not mention this detail.
4. The article mentions that the coin was likely brought to England through export trade, while the summary does not mention this detail.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. Specifically, the summary:

* Mentions an 18th century coin, while the article states that the coin is from the 600 AD period.
* Fails to mention the French rulers who created the coin.
* Fails to mention the likely export of the coin to England.

Overall, the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content.
