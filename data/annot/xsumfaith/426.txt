<Article>
Discovered on land at North Elmham, near Dereham, the circa 600 AD coin was created by French rulers of the time to increase their available currency.
Adrian Marsden, finds officer based at Norwich Castle Museum, said the object was probably buried with its owner.
The pendant was declared treasure by the Norfolk coroner on Wednesday.
Mr Marsden added: "This is an early copy of a Byzantine gold coin made in France.
"The Merovingians [French rulers] created copies of Byzantine coins from their bullion as there wasn't enough coinage coming in from the eastern Roman empire. How many of these copies were 'official' currency is hard to say."
The 23.5mm diameter pendant, created from an imitation of a gold solidus of emperor Maurice Tiberius (582-602 AD), features a suspension loop with three longitudinal ribs having been soldered to the edge of the coin immediately above the emperor's head.
"What's interesting is you have somebody in France copying a Byzantine coin which then also followed the trend of turning it into jewellery."
Mr Marsden said the coin was likely to have come to England as a result of export trade at the time.
"We see very few of these so it's an interesting find and one that we will hope to acquire for the Norwich Castle Museum collection."
Other items declared treasure at the coroner's inquest include an early-medieval Carolingian-style silver mount found in Barnham Broom, a hoard of 150 Roman coins discovered in Quidenham and an early-medieval biconical gold bead which would have been worn on high-status necklaces.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "in a norfolk village",
  "worth more than # 1m",
  "18th century"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "in a norfolk village": The article does not mention anything about the coin being found in a village. Instead, it states that the coin was found near Dereham, which is a town in Norfolk. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "worth more than # 1m": The article does not mention the value of the coin. While it's possible that the coin could be worth more than Â£1 million, there is no evidence to support this claim in the article. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. "18th century": The article states that the coin was created in the 7th century, not the 18th century. Therefore, this phrase in the summary is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations that are not supported by the article. It's important to carefully read and summarize articles to ensure that the summary is accurate and consistent with the original source.
