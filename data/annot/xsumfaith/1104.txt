<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    in the atlantic ocean, a tiny camera has been caught up in a massive eruption. 

    Article: 
    Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.
So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it.
Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online.
The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the camera was caught up in a massive eruption in the Atlantic Ocean.
2. However, the article states that the expedition is taking place in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean.
3. The article does not mention any eruption or volcanic activity in the Pacific Ocean.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no evidence of an eruption in the Pacific Ocean.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it mentions an eruption in the Atlantic Ocean, while the article takes place in the Pacific Ocean and does not mention any eruption.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the camera was caught up in a massive eruption in the Atlantic Ocean.
2. However, the article states that the expedition is taking place in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean via a robotic submarine with a camera on it.
3. The article does not mention any eruption or volcanic activity in the Pacific Ocean.
