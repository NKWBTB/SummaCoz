The Iron are currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots.
"I thought we asked a lot of questions of a very good Barrow team," Cowley told BBC Essex.
"When you come off the back of a six or seven-hour journey and you concede a goal after five minutes it's always going to be tough."
Barrow extended their unbeaten league run to nine games with the victory, and although Braintree's losing run extended to three games, Cowley remained positive.
"What we've done so far has been nothing short of remarkable," he continued. "But if anyone thought this journey was going to be easy, then they're living in cloud cuckoo land.
"We're a part-time team. This is our toughest challenge to date, but we're going to embrace it. We're going to enjoy it and see where it takes us."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Gary Cowley, the manager of Braintree Town, says his side has a "good chance" of winning the National League play-offs.
2. However, the article does not contain any quote from Cowley that suggests his team has a good chance of winning the play-offs.
3. In fact, the article states that Braintree is currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots, which suggests that their chances of winning the play-offs are not strong.
4. Additionally, the article quotes Cowley as saying that the team's journey to the play-offs will be "tough" and that they are a "part-time team" facing their "toughest challenge to date".
5. Based on these statements, it is clear that Cowley does not have a positive view of his team's chances in the play-offs, and the summary is not consistent with the article.
