The Iron are currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots.
"I thought we asked a lot of questions of a very good Barrow team," Cowley told BBC Essex.
"When you come off the back of a six or seven-hour journey and you concede a goal after five minutes it's always going to be tough."
Barrow extended their unbeaten league run to nine games with the victory, and although Braintree's losing run extended to three games, Cowley remained positive.
"What we've done so far has been nothing short of remarkable," he continued. "But if anyone thought this journey was going to be easy, then they're living in cloud cuckoo land.
"We're a part-time team. This is our toughest challenge to date, but we're going to embrace it. We're going to enjoy it and see where it takes us."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Braintree is currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots. This suggests that the team is not currently in a strong position to win the play-offs.
2. The article quotes Gary Cowley as saying, "When you come off the back of a six or seven-hour journey and you concede a goal after five minutes it's always going to be tough." This suggests that the team has recently had a long journey and faced a difficult opponent, which could make it harder for them to win the play-offs.
3. The article also quotes Cowley as saying, "We're a part-time team. This is our toughest challenge to date, but we're going to embrace it. We're going to enjoy it and see where it takes us." This suggests that the team is facing a challenging season and is taking a positive attitude towards it.
4. Based on these statements, it is not consistent with the article to summarize that the Braintree manager says his side has a "good chance" of winning the play-offs. The article does not provide any information to support this statement, and in fact suggests that the team is facing challenges and has a tough road ahead.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistency lies in the statement "good chance" of winning the play-offs. The article does not provide any evidence to support this statement, and instead suggests that the team is facing challenges and has a tough road ahead.
