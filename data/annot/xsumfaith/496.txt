    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    braintree town manager gary cowley says his side have a ``good chance\'\'of winning the national league play-offs. 

    Article: 
    The Iron are currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots.
"I thought we asked a lot of questions of a very good Barrow team," Cowley told BBC Essex.
"When you come off the back of a six or seven-hour journey and you concede a goal after five minutes it's always going to be tough."
Barrow extended their unbeaten league run to nine games with the victory, and although Braintree's losing run extended to three games, Cowley remained positive.
"What we've done so far has been nothing short of remarkable," he continued. "But if anyone thought this journey was going to be easy, then they're living in cloud cuckoo land.
"We're a part-time team. This is our toughest challenge to date, but we're going to embrace it. We're going to enjoy it and see where it takes us." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Braintree has a "good chance" of winning the national league play-offs.
2. However, the article states that Braintree is currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots. This implies that the team has a relatively low chance of making the play-offs, rather than a "good chance."
3. The article also mentions that Braintree's losing run has extended to three games, which further suggests that the team is not in a strong position to make the play-offs.
4. Therefore, based on the information in the article, it is not consistent with the summary's statement that Braintree has a "good chance" of winning the national league play-offs.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it presents a more positive outlook on Braintree's chances than the article actually provides.
