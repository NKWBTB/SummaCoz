<Article>
Mr Hockey's appointment comes after he left politics following his removal as treasurer by Malcolm Turnbull.
He had been seen as a close ally of Tony Abbott who was ousted as PM by Mr Turnbull in a party vote in September.
Mr Turnbull said Mr Hockey was "a great Australian, he is one of the most engaging, persuasive people I've known in public life".
"He's held very high office, he's got great contacts in the United States, he's a passionate patriot," he told Australian media.
Announcing the appointment, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia's relationship with the United States was the "bedrock of foreign and defence policy".
Some in the Labor opposition questioned the move, citing Mr Turnbull's role in ousting Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey's departure from politics.
"This is a very important posting for Australia and should be done by someone with a deep interest for foreign affairs," said deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek.
"There is no doubt this is a captain's pick by Malcolm Turnbull," she told ABC television.
Kim Beazley, who has has been Australia's ambassador to the United States since 2010, will be replaced by Mr Hockey in January.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Joe Hockey is the former treasurer of Australia, but the summary only refers to him as "joe." This is inconsistent because the article uses his full name, while the summary uses a nickname.
2. The article provides more information about Mr. Hockey's background and qualifications, such as his previous role as treasurer and his departure from politics. The summary does not include any of this information.
3. The article quotes Mr. Hockey's predecessor as ambassador to the United States, Kim Beazley, as well as the current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek. The summary does not include any quotes or statements from these individuals.
4. The article emphasizes the significance of the appointment and the importance of the relationship between Australia and the United States. The summary does not provide any context or analysis of the appointment or its implications.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete or accurate representation of the article's content. It is missing important details and context, and it uses a nickname instead of the full name of the subject. Therefore, it is not consistent with the article.
