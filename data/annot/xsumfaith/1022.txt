    Summary: 
    pakistan has lifted a ban on youtube over accessing content to youtube, the country\'s supreme court has ruled. 

    Article: 
    Pakistan's telecoms regulator said the ban was no longer necessary because Google, which owns YouTube, had now launched a Pakistan-specific version.
YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content.
Many young Pakistanis have welcomed the lifting of the ban but some activists want details of the deal with Google.
They say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government.
A Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official confirmed to the BBC that all internet service providers had been directed to open access to YouTube.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday: "Welcome Back YouTube".
Pakistan's ministry of information technology said: "Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly.
"Google/YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan."
However, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted.
"We have clear community guidelines, and when videos violate those rules, we remove them," she said.
"In addition, where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country, we may restrict access to it after a thorough review."
She said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report.
Pakistan's ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.
The amateur-made video was condemned in the Muslim world and sparked widespread protests for its mocking portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.
More than a dozen people died in protests in Pakistan.
Blasphemy is a crime in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty, although such a sentence has not been carried out.
Google revealed last week that it had launched local versions of YouTube for Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Pakistan has lifted a ban on YouTube, but the article states that the ban was not lifted, but rather, the government has directed internet service providers to open access to YouTube.
2. The summary mentions that the ban was lifted because Google has launched a Pakistan-specific version of YouTube, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that Google has provided a process for the government to request the removal of offending content.
3. The summary does not mention that the government will not automatically grant requests for content removal, as stated in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the specific reasons for the ban, such as the protests and deaths that occurred in 2012 after the upload of the US-made film Innocence of Muslims, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article and omits important details.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Pakistan's supreme court has lifted a ban on YouTube, but the article only mentions the ban was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012. Instead, the article states that the government has directed internet service providers to open access to YouTube.
