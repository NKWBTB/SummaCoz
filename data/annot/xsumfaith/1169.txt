    Summary: 
    plans to demolish a five-storey hotel in bournemouth have been approved. 

    Article: 
    Three Victorian hotels will go to make way for a six-storey, four star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, at East Cliff in Bournemouth.
English Heritage strongly objected to the scale of the development in what is a designated conservation area.
But, councillors voted seven to three in favour saying it would help tourism.
Chair of the planning board and Conservative ward councillor David Kelsey, said the buildings earmarked for demolition were nice but no longer "necessarily functional".
"They've come to the end of their working lives, we need to preserve the tourism aspect while improving living for older people in the town," he said.
"The loss of buildings and trees are always regrettable but we can't stand still, we need to move forward."
The site on Grove Road and East Overcliff Drive will get a 90-room hotel along with a nine-storey and seven-storey building, comprising 122 assisted-living apartments.
Applicants The East Cliff Project LLP will demolish Bay View Court, The Cottonwood and the Ocean View hotels.
The council received 246 letters supporting the plans.
Forty-nine residents and the Ancient Monuments Society wrote to object to the demolition, stating that despite being altered, they still "give a sense of the historic character of the area".
English Heritage said the scale of the development would cause "severe harm" to the conservation area. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the given summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that plans to demolish a five-storey hotel in Bournemouth have been approved.

However, the article does not mention anything about a five-storey hotel. Instead, it talks about the demolition of three Victorian hotels to make way for a six-storey, four-star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks.

2. The summary mentions that the plans have been approved by councillors, but the article states that the plans were approved despite objections from English Heritage and some residents.

3. The summary does not mention the objections raised by English Heritage and the residents, nor does it mention the reasons why the councillors approved the plans despite these objections.

4. The article states that the demolition of the three Victorian hotels will be replaced by a six-storey hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, which is not mentioned in the summary.

5. Finally, the summary does not mention the scale of the development, which is a key issue in the article. The article states that the scale of the development has been objected to by English Heritage, who argue that it will cause "severe harm" to the conservation area.

Therefore, based on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
