<Article>
The Cherries went down 2-1 at Sunderland on Saturday, becoming the first team to lose to the Black Cats in the Premier League this season.
Dan Gosling's goal, which gave them the lead, was their first for three games.
"It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games."
He continued: "A couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take."
Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser, even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar's dismissal.
"We've had enough chances to win three games today," Howe added.
"Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it. It's how you move on from that which is key."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Bournemouth lost 2-1 to Sunderland, but the summary claims that Eddie Howe said their poor start to the Premier League season was a "disaster." This is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of a "poor start" or "disaster" in the article.
2. The article does mention that Bournemouth had not scored a goal in their previous three games, but the summary exaggerates this by saying "a couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take." This is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Bournemouth have been struggling to score for a longer period of time than the article suggests.
3. The article also mentions that Bournemouth had enough chances to win three games, but the summary misinterprets this by saying "bournemouth boss eddie howe says his side's poor start to the premier league season was a `disaster`." This is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Eddie Howe said their poor start was a "disaster," which is not supported by the text.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates and misinterprets some of the information presented in the article.
