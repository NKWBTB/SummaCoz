    Summary: 
    bournemouth boss eddie howe says his side\'s poor start to the premier league season was a ``disaster\'\'. 

    Article: 
    The Cherries went down 2-1 at Sunderland on Saturday, becoming the first team to lose to the Black Cats in the Premier League this season.
Dan Gosling's goal, which gave them the lead, was their first for three games.
"It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "We scored six goals against Hull prior to these two games."
He continued: "A couple of weeks later, if you were to put the chances we've created together into a clip sequence, the fact that we haven't even scored one goal is difficult to take."
Bournemouth were stunned by goals for Sunderland from Victor Anichebe and a Jermain Defoe penalty and they were unable to find an equaliser, even against 10 men following Steven Pienaar's dismissal.
"We've had enough chances to win three games today," Howe added.
"Sometimes football pans out that way and you have to accept it. It's how you move on from that which is key." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Eddie Howe called Bournemouth's poor start to the Premier League season a "disaster."
2. However, in the article, Eddie Howe is quoted as saying "It shouldn't be down to a lack of confidence." This suggests that he does not think the poor start is a disaster, but rather a result of other factors.
3. Additionally, the article states that Bournemouth created several chances against Sunderland, but were unable to score, which further undermines the idea that the poor start is a disaster.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it presents a more negative view of the situation than what is actually stated in the article.
