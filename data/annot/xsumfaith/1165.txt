</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Moroccan football club was fined £7,000 after fans threw flares and flares at the team's stadium in London.
2. However, the article states that the stadium is located in Morocco, not London.
3. The article also does not mention anything about the club being fined £7,000. Instead, it states that the club was fined 100,000 dirhams (£7,170) by the Moroccan Football Federation (FMRFF) for the fan trouble.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it provides incorrect information about the location of the stadium and the fine imposed on the club.
