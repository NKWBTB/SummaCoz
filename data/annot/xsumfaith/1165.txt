    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Moroccan football club was fined £7,000 after fans threw flares and flares at the team's stadium in London. However, the article does not mention anything about the stadium being in London. Instead, it states that the stadium is located in Morocco and that the fans threw flares and ripped up parts of the Mohammed V stadium.
2. The article states that 31 people were arrested for "acts of vandalism," but the summary does not mention anything about arrests or vandalism.
3. The article states that the club was fined 100,000 dirhams (£7,170), but the summary states that the fine was £7,000.
4. The article states that prosecutors have opened an inquiry into the fan trouble, but the summary does not mention anything about an inquiry.

Therefore, based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
