    Summary: 
    great britain\'s laura muir has won the scottish 1500m title at the european indoor championships in stockholm. 

    Article: 
    The 23-year-old from Kinross finished second behind Kenyan Faith Kipyegon in four minutes, 19.12 seconds.
That erased Yvonne Murray's 1994 effort of 4:22.60 in the Scottish rankings and moved her second on the British all-time list behind Zola Budd's 4:17.57.
The new record holder said: "I am really pleased to get that Scottish record. It means a lot to me."
Muir, who finished fifth in last year's World Championships, now holds the Scottish 1500m and mile records.
"This is my first race of the season over this distance, so I am really pleased," she said.
"Faith's been running so quick, so to get so close to her, I'm excited.
Murray's husband, Tom Mooney, said on Facebook: "Yvonne says: 'Well done to you, Laura."
Muir hopes to secure an Olympics place for Great Britain in Rio at the British trials in Birmingham from 24 to 26 June.
The Scot started her season with an 800m victory in Montbeliard, France, last week and next competes in a week's time in a 1500m race in Stockholm.
"Training's been going really, so I was expecting to run a good race," added Muir, who fits her training around her veterinary studies. She recently completed her fourth year of vet school.
