<Article>
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wants the mascot to be replaced with a modern animal-friendly version.
The group has suggested a fish with the slogan Skegness - A Happy Plaice.
The mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for Jolly to be axed.
The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness.
The poster featured the slogan "Skegness is so bracing".
It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort.
However, Dawn Carr, of Peta, said Jolly "evokes images of cruelty to animals".
"Fish being tricked into impaling themselves in the mouth, animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stomachs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out."
"This is what the Jolly Fisherman represents," she said.
She said Peta's suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination.
"One where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated."
Skegness's mayor, Carl Macey, said the Jolly Fisherman was loved by adults and children alike.
He said: "Animal cruelty is something we don't want to be portrayed for, but I don't feel Jolly has ever come across in that manner.
"He is just accepted as happy and friendly and he does such a wonderful job for Skegness.
"It [Peta's suggestion] will go before council, but if it isn't broken we won't try and fix it."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that an animal rights group is calling for the Skegness mascot, the Jolly Fisherman, to be replaced with a fish. This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about replacing the Jolly Fisherman with a fish. Instead, the article mentions that PETA is suggesting a fish as a modern animal-friendly version of the mascot.
2. The summary uses the word "fish" twice, which is not consistent with the article. The article only mentions "fish" once, in the context of PETA's suggestion for a modern animal-friendly version of the mascot.
3. The summary does not provide any information about why PETA is calling for the Jolly Fisherman to be replaced. The article provides more information about PETA's reasons for wanting the mascot to be replaced, including their concerns about animal cruelty and their desire to rebrand Skegness as a progressive holiday destination.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and it contains inconsistencies in terms of the use of the word "fish" and the lack of information about PETA's reasons for wanting the Jolly Fisherman to be replaced.
