    Summary: 
    an animal rights group is calling for the skegness mascot, the jolly fisherman, to be replaced with a fish. 

    Article: 
    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wants the mascot to be replaced with a modern animal-friendly version.
The group has suggested a fish with the slogan Skegness - A Happy Plaice.
The mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for Jolly to be axed.
The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness.
The poster featured the slogan "Skegness is so bracing".
It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort.
However, Dawn Carr, of Peta, said Jolly "evokes images of cruelty to animals".
"Fish being tricked into impaling themselves in the mouth, animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stomachs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out."
"This is what the Jolly Fisherman represents," she said.
She said Peta's suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination.
"One where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated."
Skegness's mayor, Carl Macey, said the Jolly Fisherman was loved by adults and children alike.
He said: "Animal cruelty is something we don't want to be portrayed for, but I don't feel Jolly has ever come across in that manner.
"He is just accepted as happy and friendly and he does such a wonderful job for Skegness.
"It [Peta's suggestion] will go before council, but if it isn't broken we won't try and fix it." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Peta is calling for the Jolly Fisherman mascot to be replaced with a fish, but the article does not mention replacing the mascot with a fish. Instead, Peta is suggesting a modern animal-friendly version of the mascot.
2. The summary implies that Peta's suggestion is to replace Jolly with a fish because Jolly is associated with animal cruelty, but the article does not mention this reason. Instead, Peta's spokesperson, Dawn Carr, is quoted as saying that the Jolly Fisherman represents mutilation and killing of sea animals, but the article does not state that Jolly is actually associated with these practices.
3. The summary states that the mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome, but the article quotes the mayor as saying that he does not think there would be much support for Jolly to be axed. This suggests that the mayor does not support replacing Jolly with a fish or any other mascot.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents Peta's suggestion and the mayor's stance on the issue.
