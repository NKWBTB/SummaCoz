<Article>
Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016.
This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m.
Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield.
The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors.
It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear.
In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict.
"We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one.
"The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "first half ",
  "first half",
  NaN,
  "scottish food company"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "first half" - The article does not mention "first half" explicitly. The time period mentioned is "the year to the end of June 2016".
2. "#" - The article does not mention any profit figure in pounds (#). The profit figure mentioned is £800,000.
3. NaN - The article does not mention anything about NaN (Not a Number).
4. "scottish food company" - The article mentions "Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group" as the company name, not "scottish food company".

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains inaccuracies and ambiguities in the following spans:

* "first half"
* "#"
* NaN
* "scottish food company"

The correct summary should be:

"Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000 to £3.5m in the year to the end of June 2016, despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m. The company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors, and has a network of 19 shops across Scotland."
