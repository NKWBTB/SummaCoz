A man has been charged and another man arrested in connection with the first attack, which is being treated as a separate incident, the force said.
Meanwhile, detectives continue to appeal for a Good Samaritan who picked up the victim after she was raped for the second time.
Police said the driver of the second vehicle, described as a people carrier-type car, is believed to have given the victim a lift home after she was raped a second time. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of raping a 15-year-old girl in Birmingham.
2. However, the article states that the man was arrested in connection with the rape of the teenager in a vehicle in the Witton area at around 02:00 BST on 26 July.
3. The article does not mention anything about the man being arrested for raping a 15-year-old girl. Instead, it states that the man was arrested in connection with the rape of the teenager in a vehicle.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different crime (raping a 15-year-old girl) than what is mentioned in the article (rape of the teenager in a vehicle).

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is because it mentions a different crime than what is mentioned in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of raping a 15-year-old girl in Birmingham. However, the article does not mention the age of the victim is 15.
