Sat at one of the cafÃ©'s tables is Scotsman Mark Connor. A singer and radio DJ, he performs at a nearby Irish bar.
He has been paying close attention to the referendum debate and is annoyed by some of the arguments being put forward by the Remain side.

Whilst one couple worried about their pensions, the others did not seem particularly bothered about being charged for health care; almost all of them had private health insurance.
John Richardson, summed up the mood best. ''Oh, they'll sort something out''.
