Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the interactive video may not work on some older browsers, but there is a non-interactive version of the content below.
2. The article mentions that the video explores how ownership and ranking of some of the biggest brands in the UK is changing, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article mentions that the video is from the BBC, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that the video is about the reasons why we change what we buy, but the summary only mentions that the world's biggest food video may not be able to buy a domestic food freezer.
5. The article provides links to extra information used in the video, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only focuses on one specific aspect of the video (the ability to buy a domestic food freezer) and leaves out other important information such as the source of the video, the ownership and ranking of brands, and the extra information provided.
