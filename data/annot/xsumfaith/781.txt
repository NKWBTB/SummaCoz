Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the interactive video may not work on some older browsers, and provides a non-interactive version of the content below.
2. The summary states that the world's biggest food video may not be able to buy a domestic food freezer.
3. The article does not mention anything about the world's biggest food video or the ability to buy a domestic food freezer. In fact, the article is about the Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising in London and the reasons why we change what we buy.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not provide information about the world's biggest food video or the ability to buy a domestic food freezer, and the summary is not supported by the information in the article.

Overall, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.
