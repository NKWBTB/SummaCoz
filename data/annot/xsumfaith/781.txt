     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that the world's biggest food video may not be able to buy a domestic food freezer, but the article does not mention anything about a food video or the inability to buy a domestic freezer.
2. The summary refers to the BBC, but the article does not mention the BBC.
3. The summary mentions that the video explores how ownership and ranking of some of the biggest brands in the UK is changing, but the article does not mention anything about ownership or ranking of brands.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article. The article is actually about a video that explores why we change what we buy, and it includes information about the arrival of the domestic freezer, cheaper imports, and the impact on popular items and brands in the UK.
