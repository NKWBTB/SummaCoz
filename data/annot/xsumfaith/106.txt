    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the republic of ireland\'s two main political parties are to vote on whether to take control of water charges. 

    Article: 
    Acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Fine Gael and Micheál Martin of  Fianna Fáil hope to avoid a second election.
Mr Martin has said his party will facilitate a minority government, but will not support a programme for government.
Water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement.
A commission to consider the future of national water utility Irish Water is one of the proposals being considered.
Fianna Fáil want to see the immediate removal of water charges, but Fine Gael see a role for them.
Following the election, almost two months ago, Fine Gael had 50 seats, Fianna Fáil 44, Sinn Féin 23 and the Labour Party got seven.
But no party was able to form a majority government and TDs have so far failed to elect a taoiseach. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the two main political parties in the Republic of Ireland are to vote on whether to take control of water charges.

2. However, the article states that water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement, and that Fianna Fáil wants to see the immediate removal of water charges, while Fine Gael sees a role for them.

3. Therefore, it is unlikely that the two parties would be voting on whether to take control of water charges, as they have fundamentally different positions on the issue.

4. Instead, the article suggests that the parties are more likely to be discussing the formation of a minority government, with Fianna Fáil facilitating a government but not supporting a programme for government.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the current state of negotiations between the political parties in the Republic of Ireland.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the two main political parties in the Republic of Ireland are to vote on whether to take control of water charges. 2. However, the article states that water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement. In the article, there is no mention of voting to take control of water charges. Instead, the two parties are negotiating to reach an agreement.
