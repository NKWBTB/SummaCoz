    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

The 32-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police said a 33-year-old man from Waterlooville had been arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention.
The road was closed between Thursley and Liphook until early evening while officers investigated the scene. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man died after the car he was driving crashed into a wall in central London.
2. However, the article states that the crash happened on the southbound carriageway near the Hindhead tunnel at Bramshott, which is not in central London.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because the location of the crash does not match.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the location of the crash is incorrect. The article states that the crash happened near the Hindhead tunnel at Bramshott, but the summary states that the crash happened in central London.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the man died after the car he was driving crashed into a wall in central London. However, the article states that the crash happened on the southbound carriageway near the Hindhead tunnel at Bramshott, which is not in central London.
2. The summary states that the car driver died. However, the article states that a 33-year-old man from Waterlooville had been arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention. The article indicates the driver was arreseted, therefore he is not died.
