    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a fire that destroyed a disused waste site in eamonn, county down, is to be investigated by the environment agency. 

    Article: 
    Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays.
The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.
The firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said.
Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.
Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."
The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.
"The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said.
An EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.
"Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste."
The cause of the fire remains undetermined. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Environment Agency (EA) has suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste, and that the company is no longer able to operate from the site. However, the summary states that the EA is investigating the fire. This is inconsistent, as the article indicates that the EA has already taken enforcement action against the company.
2. The article mentions that the fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport, and the environment. However, the summary does not mention anything about the fire service's concerns or the EA's decision to take enforcement action. This is inconsistent, as the article provides important context about the events leading up to the EA's decision.
3. The article states that the EA has revoked the environmental permit for the site, which means that the company is no longer able to operate from that site. However, the summary does not mention the revocation of the permit or the company's inability to operate from the site. This is inconsistent, as the article provides important information about the consequences of the EA's decision.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events and information provided in the article. Specifically, the summary does not mention the fire service's concerns, the EA's decision to take enforcement action, or the revocation of the environmental permit.
