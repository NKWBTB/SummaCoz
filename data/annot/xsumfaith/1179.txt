    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a 14-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murdering his father, but the article states that the boy, Julian Hernandez, disappeared when he was five and is now 18. This is inconsistent, as a 14-year-old boy would not have been able to murder his father if he disappeared when he was five.

2. The summary also states that the boy was arrested on suspicion of murdering his father, but the article does not mention any suspicion of murder. Instead, the article states that the father, Bobby Hernandez, was arrested and is being held on a charge of tampering with records in Ohio so he could obtain a driver's license in 2012.

3. The summary does not mention the fact that the father is also charged with tampering with records in Ohio, which is mentioned in the article.

4. The article states that authorities suspected around the time of the boy's disappearance that his father was possibly the culprit, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information and leaves out important details.
