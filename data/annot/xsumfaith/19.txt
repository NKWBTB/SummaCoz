1. The summary states that the accused, Robbie Walsh, was charged with murder, but the article states that he was charged with assault causing serious harm to Mr. Haugh.
2. The summary mentions that two other men were released without charge, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that the accused was one of three people who entered the Marian Estate looking for Mr. Haugh, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that the fight ensued where weapons were used, but the article only mentions that knives and golf clubs were recovered at the scene.
5. The summary states that Mr. Haugh was pronounced dead at 6:00 am, but the article states that he was pronounced dead at 1:00 am.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that change the meaning of the events described.
