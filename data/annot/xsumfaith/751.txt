Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Powys council has been awarded a contract by the UK government to provide a service in place of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).
2. The article does not mention anything about the UK government providing funding to Powys council. Instead, it states that Powys council will receive £170,000 per year to carry out the work.
3. The summary states that Powys council has voted to introduce a new team from the UK government to help fund the estate agents. This is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of the UK government providing funding to Powys council.
4. The word "fund" in the summary is therefore inconsistent with the article, as the article does not mention the UK government providing funding to Powys council.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the UK government will provide funding to Powys council, whereas the article states that Powys council will receive £170,000 per year to carry out the work.
