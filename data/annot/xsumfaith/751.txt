It will be able to issue warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws.
The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT.
Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work.
People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary.
However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached.
James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future.
He spoke to Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales' Peter Johnson about what the new role will involve. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Powys Council has voted to introduce a new team from the UK government to help fund the estate agents. However, the article does not mention anything about the UK government introducing a new team or providing funding for estate agents.
2. The article states that Powys Council will receive £170,000 a year to carry out the work of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which was disbanded by the UK government. This suggests that the council is taking on the role of the OFT, rather than the UK government introducing a new team.
3. The article also states that the council will have the power to issue warning and banning orders against estate agents who act dishonestly or breach estate agent laws. This suggests that the council is taking on a regulatory role, rather than providing funding for estate agents.
4. The summary does not mention the council's regulatory role or its power to issue warning and banning orders. Instead, it focuses solely on the council receiving funding from the UK government.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the nature of the council's role and the source of its funding. The article portrays the council as taking on a regulatory role, while the summary suggests that the UK government is introducing a new team to provide funding for estate agents.
