Grant Ward's scuffed shot put Town ahead before Luke Varney rolled the ball into an empty net after QPR keeper Alex Smithies miscued a clearance.
Cole Skuse's long-range shot fell to Tom Lawrence, who capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner.
Rangers offered little in attack, but sub Sandro headed Tjarron Cherry's corner against the post late on.
Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies.
The Rs have won only once in their last six matches away from Loftus Road, and rarely looked like improving that record in Ian Holloway's second game in charge.
The win lifted Mick McCarthy's Ipswich up four places to 14th and above Rangers, who slipped to 15th.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "The irony was that poor old Alex Smithies cost them the second goal which set us up to win as comprehensively as we did. He then kept it from being an embarrassing scoreline, but I'll take three.
"With Luke Varney and also Jonathan Douglas, I knew what I was going to get - even though I bet some people weren't thinking that when they saw the teamsheet. Luke epitomised everything what I want in this team.
"We have not been bristling with confidence. I have had a couple of rotten weekends after Rotherham and Nottingham Forest. But hopefully Ipswich can be a happier place than it has been."
QPR boss Ian Holloway:  "I am sure everyone will say everything hinged on the second goal, but it shouldn't have.
"The goal was a calamity and after that we were awful and it could have been four or five.
"Everyone will blame my keeper but I won't as my defenders should have made an angle for him. Even with my legs, I would have ran back and tried to help him.
"My players need to be mentally tougher as a group. I am disappointed with how we finished today. We have got to try and be a bigger, braver and more solid team."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Ipswich Town had their biggest win of the season, but the article states that the team had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games. This is inconsistent, as a team that has struggled to score would not have had their biggest win of the season.
2. The summary does not mention the scuffed shot that Grant Ward put into the net, which was the first goal for Ipswich Town. This is inconsistent, as the article highlights this goal as a key moment in the match.
3. The summary states that Ipswich Town "capped the scoring with a calm finish into the corner," but the article does not mention a calm finish. Instead, it states that Tom Lawrence capped the scoring with a "cool finish" into the bottom left corner.
4. The summary mentions that QPR offered little in attack, but the article states that QPR had a few chances, including a header against the post from Sandro. This is inconsistent, as the article suggests that QPR had more opportunities to score than the summary indicates.
5. The summary states that the win lifted Ipswich Town up four places to 14th, but the article states that the team moved up to 15th, not 14th. This is inconsistent, as the article provides the correct information about the team's position in the table.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of the match. The summary does not mention key moments from the game, such as the scuffed shot that led to Ipswich Town's first goal, and it does not accurately convey the performance of QPR.
