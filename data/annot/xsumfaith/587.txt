</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "two-year deal",
  "striker",
  "national league club"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "two-year deal" - The article states that Jackson has signed for Barnsley "ahead of their League One play-off final at Wembley on Sunday", which implies that the deal is for one season, not two.
2. "striker" - The article refers to Jackson as a "striker", but it does not mention this explicitly. While it's likely that Jackson plays as a striker, the article does not confirm this.
3. "national league club" - The article states that Jackson played for Wrexham in the National League, but the club is not referred to as a "national league club". The correct term would be "League One club".

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the text. Specifically, the summary states that Jackson has signed a two-year deal, which is not mentioned in the article, and refers to Wrexham as a "national league club", which is not the correct term.
