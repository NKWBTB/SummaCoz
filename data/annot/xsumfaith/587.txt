    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Barnsley signed Kayden Jackson from Wrexham on a two-year deal.
2. The article does not mention any information about a two-year deal. Instead, it states that Jackson turned down a contract offer from Wrexham for next season.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Jackson signed a two-year deal with Barnsley, while the article states that he turned down a contract offer from Wrexham for next season.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it includes information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions a two-year deal, which is not mentioned in the article.
