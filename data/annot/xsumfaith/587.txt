barnsley have signed striker kayden jackson from national league club wrexham on a two-year deal.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Barnsley have signed striker Kayden Jackson from National League club Wrexham on a two-year deal.
2. However, the article states that Jackson scored four goals in 36 appearances for Wrexham last season, and that he turned down a contract offer from the club for next season.
3. This information in the article does not support the statement in the summary that Jackson has signed a two-year deal with Barnsley.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement in the summary is incorrect.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it states that Jackson has signed a two-year deal with Barnsley, but the article states that he turned down a contract offer from Wrexham and does not mention any deal with Barnsley.
