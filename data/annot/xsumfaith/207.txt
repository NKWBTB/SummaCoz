<Article>
Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme.
GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character".
Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform.
"If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Luke Williams is one of 14 successful candidates in the Fighting Chance scheme, but the summary claims that he is the first person to take part in a professional taekwondo program in Great Britain. This is not consistent with the article.
2. The article mentions that Luke has not got the tactical game finesse like his sister Jade, but the summary makes no mention of his sister or any other details about his background.
3. The article states that the 14 successful candidates will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June, but the summary does not mention anything about training or the Austrian Open.
4. The article quotes Gary Hall, the GB Taekwondo chief, as saying that this is one of the strongest intakes they have had, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates Luke's achievement, omits important details about his background, and fails to mention key aspects of the Fighting Chance scheme.
