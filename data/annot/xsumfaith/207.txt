    Summary: 
    double olympic taekwondo champion luke williams has become the first person to take part in a professional taekwondo programme in great britain. 

    Article: 
    Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme.
GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character".
Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform.
"If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Luke Williams is a double Olympic taekwondo champion, but the article does not mention anything about him winning Olympic medals.

2. The article states that Luke is one of 14 successful candidates selected for a professional taekwondo program, but the summary does not mention anything about the program being professional.

3. The article mentions that Luke's sister, Jade, is also a taekwondo athlete, but the summary does not mention anything about her.

4. The article states that the 14 selected candidates will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June, but the summary does not mention anything about the Austrian Open or the training regime.

5. The article mentions that the group of selected candidates is "really strong" and that they will be assessed to see how they perform, but the summary does not mention anything about the strength of the group or the assessment.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
