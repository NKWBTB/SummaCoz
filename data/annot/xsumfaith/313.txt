BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died.
A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset.
The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.
The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to Â£11.7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care "must be eliminated by 2020/21".
"We will work to a faster timetable if at all possible," said a spokeswoman.
"We will consider Dr Carlyon's letter in detail once it arrives."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a coroner has called for a review of the death of a man who died after being hit by a train in Cornwall.
2. However, the article does not mention a coroner calling for a review of the death. Instead, it reports that a jury concluded that the death was suicide and that the Department of Health has admitted that "unacceptable" patients are receiving care far from home.
3. The article also mentions that the county coroner, Dr. Emma Carlyon, was understood to be satisfied with the commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. Specifically, it does not mention the jury's conclusion that the death was suicide, the Department of Health's admission about out-of-area care, or the county coroner's satisfaction with the local commitment to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients leave the county for treatment.
