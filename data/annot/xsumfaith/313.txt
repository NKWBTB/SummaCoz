BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died.
A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset.
The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.
The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to Â£11.7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care "must be eliminated by 2020/21".
"We will work to a faster timetable if at all possible," said a spokeswoman.
"We will consider Dr Carlyon's letter in detail once it arrives."

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the coroner has called for a review of the death, but the article does not mention any such call.

2. The summary mentions the death being due to a train hitting the man, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the man died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on a viaduct.

3. The summary does not mention the jury's conclusion that the man's death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support, which is a key point in the article.

4. The summary does not mention the fact that the man was being treated in Somerset because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall, which is also a key point in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and is therefore not consistent with it.
