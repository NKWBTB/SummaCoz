    Summary: 
    a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in dundee. 

    Article: 
    Clive Weatherhogg set up meetings between the woman and a man he found through an adult website, and filmed them having sex.
A court heard he sent a message containing a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day.
Weatherhogg, 42, was also placed on the sex offenders register.
He had denied the charges but was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff George Way remitted the case to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because its greater sentencing powers.
Weatherhogg, formerly of Guthrie, near Forfar, was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with the man between 10 September, 2013 and 17 September the following year.
He was also convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on 25 December, 2014.
The woman told the trial she had felt "blackmailed" by Weatherhogg.
Lady Wolffe told the Weatherhogg that she had to pass a sentence on him that "reflected society's abhorrence" at such conduct.
The judge said that Weatherhogg, a first offender, had been assessed as posing "a moderate risk" of sexual re-offending.
Defence counsel Jonathan Crowe said it had been "a dramatic shock" for Weatherhogg to be placed on remand ahead of sentencing. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl, but the article does not mention the age of the victim. The article only mentions that the victim was a woman.
2. The summary states that the man was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with another man, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the man set up meetings between the woman and another man found through an adult website and filmed them having sex.
3. The summary states that the man sent a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that the man was placed on the sex offenders register, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that the man was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court, but the article does not mention the location of the trial.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
