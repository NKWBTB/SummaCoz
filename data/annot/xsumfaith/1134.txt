    Summary: 
    plans for a new power station on the site of a former coal mine in east yorkshire have been given the go-ahead. 

    Article: 
    The site at Knottingley, West Yorkshire is to burn fuel from refuse, industrial and commercial waste including wood, said operator Multifuel Energy Ltd.
The Â£300m plant is to create hundreds of jobs over a three-year build and should produce electricity for about 160,000 homes, it said.
The adjoining coal-fired Ferrybridge 'C' plant is to close in March 2016, it was announced in May.
The Secretary of State has granted development consent for the new plant.
Construction is expected to begin in 2016 with about 35 permanent jobs once it is operational.
The power station is expected to produce up to 90MWe of electricity annually by burning 675,000 tonnes of waste that could have ended up in landfill, said Multifuel Energy
It is to be built next to the newly-constructed Ferrybridge Multifuel 1 that stated operations earlier this year.
Multifuel Energy is a joint venture between power company SSE and and waste management company Wheelabrator Technologies. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the power station will be built on the site of a former coal mine in east Yorkshire, but the article states that the site is in Knottingley, West Yorkshire. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary mentions that the power station will burn fuel from refuse, industrial, and commercial waste, including wood, but the article only mentions that the plant will burn waste that could have ended up in landfill. This suggests that the summary is not accurate in its description of the fuel source.
3. The summary states that the plant will produce electricity for 160,000 homes, but the article only mentions that the plant will produce up to 90MWe of electricity annually. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article in terms of the scale of the project.
4. The summary mentions that the plant will create hundreds of jobs, but the article only mentions that the plant is expected to create about 35 permanent jobs once it is operational. This suggests that the summary is not accurate in its description of the job creation aspect of the project.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article in several key respects, indicating that it is not an accurate summary of the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the power station will be built on the site of a former coal mine in east Yorkshire, but the article states that the site is in Knottingley, West Yorkshire.
2. The summary states that the power station will be built on the site of a former coal mine. However, the article does not mention any coal mine.
