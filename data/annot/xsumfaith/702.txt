  "joe thompson has signed a six-month contract with league one side rochdale, returning to the club with which he began his career"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Joe Thompson was released by Carlisle United at the end of the 2015-16 campaign, which means he was not playing for Rochdale at that time.
2. The summary states that Joe Thompson has signed a six-month contract with Rochdale, indicating that he has rejoined the club.
3. However, the article does not mention anything about Joe Thompson re-signing with Rochdale. Instead, it mentions that he was released by Carlisle United.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Joe Thompson has signed a six-month contract with Rochdale is not supported by the information in the article.

So, the consistency issue is that the summary makes a claim (Joe Thompson has signed a six-month contract with Rochdale) that is not supported by the information in the article.
