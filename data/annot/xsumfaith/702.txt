Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
1. The summary states that Joe Thompson has signed a six-month contract with League One side Rochdale, returning to the club where he began his career.
2. The article does not mention anything about Joe Thompson signing a six-month contract with Rochdale. Instead, it mentions that he was released by Carlisle United at the end of the 2015-16 campaign.
3. The article does mention that Rochdale began the 2016-17 season with a 3-2 home defeat by Peterborough on Saturday, but this information is not present in the summary.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article (Joe Thompson signing a six-month contract with Rochdale) and leaves out information that is present in the article (Rochdale's 3-2 home defeat by Peterborough on Saturday).
