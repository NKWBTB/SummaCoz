    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Joe Thompson has signed a six-month contract with Rochdale, but the article does not mention the length of his contract. The article only mentions that he has returned to the club on a loan spell.
2. The summary states that Joe Thompson began his career with Rochdale, but the article does not mention this. The article states that he made more than 150 appearances for the club before joining Tranmere in 2012.
3. The summary states that Joe Thompson was released by Carlisle United at the end of the 2015-16 campaign, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that he was released by Carlisle United.
4. The summary states that Rochdale began the 2016-17 season with a 3-2 home defeat by Peterborough on Saturday, but the article does not mention the date or the result of the match.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
