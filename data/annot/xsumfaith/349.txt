<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has been arrested on suspicion of arson after a fire at a house in west lothian. 

    Article: 
    The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a man has been arrested on suspicion of arson, but the article does not mention any arrests or suspicion of arson.
2. The article states that the fire is not thought to be suspicious and that initial enquiries suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
3. The summary mentions a man being arrested, which contradicts the article's statement that there are no suspicious circumstances.
4. The article states that the damage caused by the fire has prevented entry to the property, which suggests that there is no evidence to support the summary's claim that a man has been arrested.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement about the man being arrested is not supported by the information in the article.
