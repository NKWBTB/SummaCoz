<Article>
The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances" and "there is no known involvement of the occupant".
2. The summary mentions that a man has been arrested on suspicion of arson, which contradicts the article's statement that there are no suspicious circumstances.
3. The article also states that the fire is not thought to be suspicious and that there is no known involvement of the occupant.
4. The summary does not provide any information about the man's arrest or the fire being suspicious, which suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a man being arrested on suspicion of arson, which contradicts the article's statement that there are no suspicious circumstances.
