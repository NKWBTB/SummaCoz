<Article>
The Iron are currently sixth in the National League, one point and one place outside the play-off spots.
"I thought we asked a lot of questions of a very good Barrow team," Cowley told BBC Essex.
"When you come off the back of a six or seven-hour journey and you concede a goal after five minutes it's always going to be tough."
Barrow extended their unbeaten league run to nine games with the victory, and although Braintree's losing run extended to three games, Cowley remained positive.
"What we've done so far has been nothing short of remarkable," he continued. "But if anyone thought this journey was going to be easy, then they're living in cloud cuckoo land.
"We're a part-time team. This is our toughest challenge to date, but we're going to embrace it. We're going to enjoy it and see where it takes us."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the team is called "Braintree", not "Barrow". Therefore, the first inconsistency is:

"braintree manager danny cowley" should be "Braintree manager Danny Cowley" to match the correct team name.

2. The article never mentions the word "brilliant" in the quote from Danny Cowley. Therefore, the second inconsistency is:

"a brilliant challenge" should be removed, as it is not supported by the article.

So, the corrected summary should read:

"Braintree manager Danny Cowley said the task ahead of his team is a tough challenge after the defeat at Barrow."

This summary is consistent with the article, as it accurately reflects the quote from Danny Cowley and the team's current position in the league.
