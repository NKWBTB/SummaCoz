<Article>
Barca remain six points off leaders Real after Sergio Ramos' last-minute header made it 1-1 after Luis Suarez had opened the scoring.
"In the second half, we were the better side, but we didn't manage to get the second goal and they ended up equalising," said Enrique.
"That said, we deserved to win. It is not the best result for us."
Barca were poor in the first half but looked set to close the gap on unbeaten Real to three points before Ramos headed home Modric's free-kick.
"It was a very even first half and a second that we were better, we created chances. We continued looking for the second to avoid being levelled, but we were unable to do so," added Enrique.
"In my opinion, the performance of the team was higher than that of the rival, but we have to improve, it is clear.
"I say this even when we win, and even when we draw. We can improve in all aspects of the game. We are ambitious."
Enrique was happy to see captain Andres Iniesta return from an injury that has kept him out for six weeks.
He came on as a second-half substitute and set up a Lionel Messi chance, which the Argentine missed, with a brilliant through ball.
"It is clear that Iniesta is a unique player and his input was perfect," added Enrique.
"He entered at a key moment and, despite the difficulties of being out for so long, he gave us quality, vision and hard work."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "barcelona boss luis",
  "after they beat real madrid in the first game of the copa del rey",
  "barcelona boss luis enrique"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The first inconsistency is "barcelona boss luis" because the article never mentions Luis Enrique as the "barcelona boss." Instead, it refers to him as "Enrique" or "the coach."
2. The second inconsistency is "after they beat real madrid in the first game of the copa del rey" because the article does not mention anything about Barcelona beating Real Madrid in the first game of the Copa del Rey. The article only mentions that the teams drew 1-1.
3. The third inconsistency is "barcelona boss luis enrique" because, as previously mentioned, the article never refers to Enrique as the "barcelona boss."

Therefore, the summary has several inconsistencies with the article, and it is not an accurate representation of the content.
