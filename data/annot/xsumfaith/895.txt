    Summary: 
    barcelona boss luis enrique says his side were ``unable to get the second goal\'\'after they beat real madrid in the first game of the copa del rey. 

    Article: 
    Barca remain six points off leaders Real after Sergio Ramos' last-minute header made it 1-1 after Luis Suarez had opened the scoring.
"In the second half, we were the better side, but we didn't manage to get the second goal and they ended up equalising," said Enrique.
"That said, we deserved to win. It is not the best result for us."
Barca were poor in the first half but looked set to close the gap on unbeaten Real to three points before Ramos headed home Modric's free-kick.
"It was a very even first half and a second that we were better, we created chances. We continued looking for the second to avoid being levelled, but we were unable to do so," added Enrique.
"In my opinion, the performance of the team was higher than that of the rival, but we have to improve, it is clear.
"I say this even when we win, and even when we draw. We can improve in all aspects of the game. We are ambitious."
Enrique was happy to see captain Andres Iniesta return from an injury that has kept him out for six weeks.
He came on as a second-half substitute and set up a Lionel Messi chance, which the Argentine missed, with a brilliant through ball.
"It is clear that Iniesta is a unique player and his input was perfect," added Enrique.
"He entered at a key moment and, despite the difficulties of being out for so long, he gave us quality, vision and hard work." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Barcelona's boss, Luis Enrique, said that his side was "unable to get the second goal" after beating Real Madrid in the first game of the Copa del Rey.

2. However, the article states that Barcelona did score the first goal through Luis Suarez, and they were the better side in the second half, but they were unable to get the second goal and Real Madrid equalized.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Barcelona did not score any goals, whereas the article states that they did score one goal through Luis Suarez.

4. Additionally, the summary states that Enrique said that his side was unable to get the second goal, but the article quotes Enrique as saying that they were the better side in the second half and created chances, but were unable to score the second goal.

5. Finally, the summary does not accurately reflect Enrique's comments about the team's performance, as the article states that Enrique was happy with the team's performance and praised Iniesta's return from injury.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and does not accurately reflect Enrique's comments.
