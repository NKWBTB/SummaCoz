Barca remain six points off leaders Real after Sergio Ramos' last-minute header made it 1-1 after Luis Suarez had opened the scoring.
"In the second half, we were the better side, but we didn't manage to get the second goal and they ended up equalising," said Enrique.
"That said, we deserved to win. It is not the best result for us."
Barca were poor in the first half but looked set to close the gap on unbeaten Real to three points before Ramos headed home Modric's free-kick.
"It was a very even first half and a second that we were better, we created chances. We continued looking for the second to avoid being levelled, but we were unable to do so," added Enrique.
"In my opinion, the performance of the team was higher than that of the rival, but we have to improve, it is clear.
"I say this even when we win, and even when we draw. We can improve in all aspects of the game. We are ambitious."
Enrique was happy to see captain Andres Iniesta return from an injury that has kept him out for six weeks.
He came on as a second-half substitute and set up a Lionel Messi chance, which the Argentine missed, with a brilliant through ball.
"It is clear that Iniesta is a unique player and his input was perfect," added Enrique.
"He entered at a key moment and, despite the difficulties of being out for so long, he gave us quality, vision and hard work."
