Sophie Fearns said son Charlie, of Merseyside, needs to fly back to Seattle, America for experimental treatment unavailable in the UK.
She said he urgently needs more T-Cell Therapy at Seattle Children's Hospital after the last transplant failed.
His mother said she was "ecstatic" and "overwhelmed" by the "selfless amazing person" who paid for his treatment.
Charlie has been ill since the age of three, she said.
After a third relapse in April she said there was "no option" left for treatment for him in the UK.
Mrs Fearns said the family, of Litherland, were left "heartbroken" when the first T-Cell transplant did not work.
She said the news the treatment has been paid for was "completely overwhelming".
"We don't know who this donor is but from the bottom of our hearts it means an incredible amount - not just from the foundation but everybody that supports Charlie."
Charlie's father Rob Fearns said they were "extremely grateful" for the generosity of the anonymous donation.
"He or she specifically asked to pay for Charlie.
"We thought we were going to have to fight tooth and nail like last time to get the funds together."
His parents said they received the confirmation via an email from the hospital on Wednesday saying someone had offered to foot the bill for them.
Now Charlie has had financial clearance from the hospital, the treatment will start as soon as possible.
Mr Fearns said he is expecting to find out the date next week.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that an anonymous donor has paid for Charlie's treatment, not his mother.

2. The summary states that Charlie's mother paid for the £2,000 donation, which is not supported by the article.

3. The article clearly states that an anonymous donor paid for Charlie's treatment, and there is no mention of Charlie's mother paying for anything.

4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Charlie's mother paid for the donation, while the article states that an anonymous donor paid for the treatment.

5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the information in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Charlie's mother paid for the £2,000 donation. This is not supported by the article.
2. The article states that an anonymous donor has paid for Charlie's treatment, not his mother.
3. The summary mentions a three-year-old boy with a rare form of brain cancer.
4. However, the article does not mention the age of the patient nor the specific disease. It only mentions Charlie has been ill since the age of three. It is unclear about Charlie's current age.
