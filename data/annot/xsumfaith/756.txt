</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "capital\\'s grounds",
  "1m",
  "kent",
  "new theatre"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "capital's grounds": The article does not mention anything about the theatre being in the "capital's grounds" of Alexandra Palace. Instead, it states that the theatre is part of Alexandra Palace itself. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
2. "1m": The article does not mention a £1 million project. Instead, it states that the Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust has committed to raising the final £1 million by summer 2017. This is a different amount and timeframe than what is mentioned in the summary.
3. "kent": The article does not mention anything about Kent. The theatre is located in Alexandra Palace, which is in north London. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
4. "new theatre": The article does not mention the construction of a new theatre. Instead, it states that the existing theatre will be repaired and refurbished. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies compared to the article.
