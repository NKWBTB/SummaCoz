    Summary: 
    a theatre in kent is to undergo a # 1m project to build a new theatre in the capital\'s grounds of alexandra palace. 

    Article: 
    It is hoped the theatre, founded in 1875, will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy and live music.
The BBC studios, at the eastern end of the Palace, will also be repaired and refurbished.
If successful in raising funds it is hoped the theatre will reopen in 2018.
The theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.
As part of the renovations, the glazed east court will become a space for the public and for exhibitions.
Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) is contributing £18.8m towards the project, while Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m.
The entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of £26.6m.
Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust have committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017.
The theatre, which has languished unused for decades, still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place.
It was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays and all kinds of entertainment, even hosting early cinema screenings. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music, but the summary only mentions a new theatre being built in the capital's grounds of Alexandra Palace. The article does not mention a new theatre being built.
2. The article mentions that the BBC studios at the eastern end of the Palace will be repaired and refurbished, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article states that the theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that the Heritage Lottery Fund is contributing £18.8m towards the project, Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m, and the Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust is committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017, but the summary does not mention any of these funding sources.
5. The article states that the theatre has languished unused for decades and still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place, but the summary does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions a new theatre being built, while the article provides more details about the restoration and refurbishment of the existing theatre and BBC studios, as well as the funding sources for the project.
