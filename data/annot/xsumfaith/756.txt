Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that a new theatre is to be built in the grounds of Alexandra Palace in Kent.

Error: There is no mention of Kent in the article. The article only mentions Alexandra Palace, which is located in North London.

2. The summary mentions a £1m project to build a new theatre.

Error: The article does not mention any new theatre being built. Instead, it talks about the restoration and refurbishment of the existing Alexandra Palace theatre.

3. The summary states that the project is to be completed by summer 2017.

Error: The article does not mention a specific deadline for the project. It only states that the trust hopes to raise the final £1m by summer 2017.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a new theatre being built in Kent, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary mentions a £1m project, but the article does not mention a specific amount. Finally, the summary states that the project must be completed by summer 2017, but the article does not mention a specific deadline.
