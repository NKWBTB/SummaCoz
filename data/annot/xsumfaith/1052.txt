Water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement.
A commission to consider the future of national water utility Irish Water is one of the proposals being considered.
Fianna Fáil want to see the immediate removal of water charges, but Fine Gael see a role for them.
Following the election, almost two months ago, Fine Gael had 50 seats, Fianna Fáil 44, Sinn Féin 23 and the Labour Party got seven.
But no party was able to form a majority government and TDs have so far failed to elect a taoiseach. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the two main political parties in the Republic of Ireland are due to take part in a general election that will see a fine of up to 50%. However, the article does not mention anything about a fine.
2. The article states that the acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Fine Gael and Micheál Martin of Fianna Fáil hope to avoid a second election. This is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary states that Fianna Fáil will facilitate a minority government but will not support a program for government. This is correct, as stated in the article.
4. The article mentions that water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement, but this is not mentioned in the summary.
5. The article states that following the election, Fine Gael had 50 seats, Fianna Fáil had 44, Sinn Féin had 23, and the Labour Party got seven. This is not mentioned in the summary.
6. The article states that no party was able to form a majority government and TDs have so far failed to elect a Taoiseach. This is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a fine, which is not present in the article, and omits other important information such as the parties' hope to avoid a second election, the sticking points to reaching agreement, and the election results.
