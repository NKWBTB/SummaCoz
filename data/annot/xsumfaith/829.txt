    Summary: 
    mcdonald\'s mcdonald\'s has said it is ``proud\'\'of its franchisees and workers because it is ``proud of its franchisees\'\'. 

    Article: 
    A formal complaint has been made to the European Commission by a group of Italian consumers' organisations.
They accuse McDonald's of forcing franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees.
McDonald's said it shared risks and rewards with its licencees.
In a statement, McDonald's said: "We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses.
"This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers."
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European unions, including the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union in the UK, are supporting the formal antitrust complaint.
"McDonald's abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald's accountable," said SEIU organising director, Scott Courtney.
The European Commission said it would now study the submission. It has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded.
The consumer organisations claim franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts.
They also said licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates.
It is claimed this leads to poorer consumer choice and higher prices in franchise stores as opposed to those owned directly by the company.
Franchisees own and operate 73% of McDonald's restaurants in Europe.
McDonald's received $9.27bn (Â£6.40bn) in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide in 2014. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that McDonald's is "proud of its franchisees," but the article states that a formal complaint has been made to the European Commission by a group of Italian consumers' organisations, accusing McDonald's of forcing franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees. This suggests that McDonald's may not be as supportive of its franchisees as the summary claims.
2. The article states that the consumer organisations claim that franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts, and that licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates. This suggests that McDonald's may be using its market power to limit the ability of its franchisees to compete with other businesses.
3. The article also states that the European Commission has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded. This suggests that the Commission takes the allegations seriously and may take action against McDonald's if it finds evidence of anticompetitive behavior.
4. The summary does not mention any of these allegations or the formal complaint made to the European Commission. Instead, it focuses on McDonald's statement expressing pride in its franchisees. This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article and does not provide a fair representation of the information it contains.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the allegations made against McDonald's and the formal complaint made to the European Commission. Instead, it focuses on a statement by McDonald's expressing pride in its franchisees, which is not the main focus of the article.
