<Article>
A formal complaint has been made to the European Commission by a group of Italian consumers' organisations.
They accuse McDonald's of forcing franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees.
McDonald's said it shared risks and rewards with its licencees.
In a statement, McDonald's said: "We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses.
"This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers."
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European unions, including the Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union in the UK, are supporting the formal antitrust complaint.
"McDonald's abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald's accountable," said SEIU organising director, Scott Courtney.
The European Commission said it would now study the submission. It has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded.
The consumer organisations claim franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts.
They also said licensees lease premises from the company at above market rates.
It is claimed this leads to poorer consumer choice and higher prices in franchise stores as opposed to those owned directly by the company.
Franchisees own and operate 73% of McDonald's restaurants in Europe.
McDonald's received $9.27bn (Â£6.40bn) in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide in 2014.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that McDonald's has been accused of forcing franchisees to pay excessive rents and high fees. This is not mentioned in the summary.
2. The article mentions that the European Commission has received a formal complaint from a group of Italian consumers' organisations, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article states that the consumer organisations claim that franchisees are prevented from switching to competitors because McDonald's makes them sign longer-than-average contracts, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that the European Commission has the powers to launch an investigation if it believes the allegations are founded, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article states that McDonald's received $9.27bn in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide in 2014, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include any of the key points mentioned in the article. Instead, the summary seems to be a simplification of McDonald's statement, which is not supported by the article. The spans in the summary that have consistency issues are:

* "and workers" - this phrase is not present in the article.
* NaN - there is no value present in this span, which indicates that it is not a valid statement.
