<Article>
The Queen's Park Rangers player made his NI debut in March and scored in his second game against Slovenia.
Washington, a postman just four years ago, followed that up with another goal against Belarus on Saturday.
"The last few months have been a crazy time and I don't think it has sunk in yet. I know I have been fortunate," said the 24-year-old.
"Football can be about being in the right place at the right time, and I have been lucky.
"Maybe in a couple of years I will look back and realise how mad it has all been."
Washington  combined representing non-League St Ives between 2010 and 2012 with a job delivering mail.
Having averaged more than a goal-a-game in his 50 appearances for a club in the ninth tier, he then got his break with Newport who paid Â£5,000 for him.
The Welsh club were promoted to the Football League in his first season, although Washington barely featured.
He then moved to Peterborough in 2014 and by mid-January of this year, when QPR took him from London Road, Washington had scored 15 goals and aroused the interest of Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill.
Washington had only been to the country once before his international bow against Wales in March but he qualified through the grandparent rule.
"It was nice to be accepted so quickly and so readily with Northern Ireland," he added.
"Life doesn't get much better. I'm proud of my achievements and just have to try to enjoy it."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Gareth Washington made his international debut for Northern Ireland in March, and scored in his second game against Slovenia. However, the summary states that the "euro 2016 qualifier against northern ireland" is a "crazy moment", which implies that the player has already played in a Euro 2016 qualifier for Northern Ireland, which is not accurate.
2. The article does not mention anything about Gareth Washington playing in a Euro 2016 qualifier, only that he made his international debut in March and scored in his second game against Slovenia. Therefore, the reference to a "euro 2016 qualifier" in the summary is not supported by the article.
3. The summary also refers to "former world cup winner gareth", which is not accurate according to the article. Gareth Washington has not won a World Cup, and the article does not mention anything about him being a World Cup winner.
4. Finally, the summary does not accurately represent the content of the article, as it implies that Gareth Washington has already played in a Euro 2016 qualifier for Northern Ireland, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistencies are highlighted in the spans provided.
