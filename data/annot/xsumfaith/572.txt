It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
The firm filed an application with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday in a bid to boost growth in one of the world's fastest growing movie markets.
Imax's China profits jumped nearly 30% last year, according to the filing.
It has been rapidly expanding in the Greater China region, nearly doubling the number of theatres since 2012.
March figures indicate Imax has 239 theatres in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, but the company says it is planning to build another 219 theatres in China.
News of the listing comes as box office revenue in the world's second largest economy jumped 36% last year to $4.9bn (Â£3.2bn), which is nearly three times more than it was 2010.
The parent company is already listed in New York and its shares rose as much as 9% after the announcement.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "canadian maker of widescreen cinema theatres, is planning an initial public offering (ipo) of its china unit in hong kong",
  "the canadian maker of widescreen cinema theatres, is planning an initial public offering (ipo) of its china unit in hong kong"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Imax filed an application to list its China unit on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but the summary claims that Imax is planning an initial public offering (IPO) of its China unit in Hong Kong.
2. The article does not mention anything about an IPO, only that Imax is seeking to list its China unit on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
3. The word "ipo" is not mentioned anywhere in the article.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it uses the term "ipo" which is not present in the article, and it also refers to the company as a "canadian maker of widescreen cinema theatres" which is not accurate as the company is a global company with operations in multiple countries, not just Canada.
5. The article specifically states that Imax's China profits jumped nearly 30% last year, but the summary does not mention this fact.
6. The article also mentions that Imax has been rapidly expanding in the Greater China region, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important information that is present in the article.
