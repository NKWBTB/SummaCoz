<Article>
The Friesians were found in Dolwen, near Old Colwyn, on Friday after eating poisonous tree clippings dumped in a farmer's field.
North Wales Police said the culprit is described as a heavily built man, aged 50 to 60, with curly brown hair, driving a dark blue pick-up truck.
Anyone with information can call 101.
"Apparently he has been dumping clippings over past two weeks. Has to be living/working local to Colwyn Bay," Sgt Rob Taylor, of the rural crime team, tweeted on Sunday.
A post-mortem examination showed the cows, aged 16 months, died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings.
Sgt Taylor said he was "appalled" by the "atrocious" act of fly-tipping and praised the "impressive" response to his appeal for information on social media.

<Summary>
the description of a man believed to be involved in fly-tipping which left three conwy cows dead has been released by police.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "three conwy",
  "released"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "three conwy" - The article does not mention the number of cows that died. It only states that "the cows, aged 16 months, died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings." Therefore, the phrase "three conwy" is not supported by the article.
2. "released" - The article states that Sgt Taylor tweeted an appeal for information on social media, but it does not mention that the police released any description of a man believed to be involved in fly-tipping. Therefore, the phrase "released" is also not supported by the article.

Overall, the summary has consistency issues because it includes information that is not present in the article. The correct summary should only include information that is directly supported by the article.
