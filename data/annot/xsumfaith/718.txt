Josh Gillies beat Cameron Belford in the visitors' goal with a fine free-kick to put the Tynesiders ahead.
But Wrexham were back on level terms before half-time when Sean Newton produced an equally fine set-piece.
Ryan Bowman scored a fine winner for Gateshead, though, heading Craig Baxter's cross from the right across goal and into the net.
Gateshead manager Malcolm Crosby told BBC Newcastle: "To go and beat Wrexham tells me we have a decent side.
"We were disappointing in the first half but you have to give Wrexham credit because they played really well.
"In the first half, we didn't pass the ball well enough but in the second half, we did; that made the big difference.
"You come to watch football to see goals like our second one. It was a great bit of play, a wonderful cross and a great finish."
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It was disappointing. We've had two or three games now when the second half has not been as good as the first.
"We were too open at times in the second half... having said that we've had some good chances and we haven't stuck it in the back of the net.
"They've not had a load of chances: a good free-kick for the first one and then obviously a good headers for the second one."
