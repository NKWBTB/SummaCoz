It is hoped the theatre, founded in 1875, will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy and live music.
The BBC studios, at the eastern end of the Palace, will also be repaired and refurbished.
If successful in raising funds it is hoped the theatre will reopen in 2018.
The theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.
As part of the renovations, the glazed east court will become a space for the public and for exhibitions.
Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) is contributing £18.8m towards the project, while Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m.
The entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of £26.6m.
Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust have committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017.
The theatre, which has languished unused for decades, still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place.
It was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays and all kinds of entertainment, even hosting early cinema screenings.

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "victorian" - The article does not mention the word "victorian" to describe the theatre. The theatre was founded in 1875, but the article only states that it has been unused for decades. Therefore, the summary should not have included the word "victorian".
2. "80 years" - The article states that the theatre has been unused for decades, but it does not specify the exact number of years. The summary should not have included the number "80" without evidence from the article.
3. "bring its victorian theatre back to life after lying unused for 80 years" - The article does not mention the word "victorian" to describe the theatre, and it does not state that the theatre has been unused for 80 years. The summary should not have included these phrases.

Therefore, the summary should have read:

"Alexandra Palace has started a £1m fundraising campaign to restore its historic theatre, which has been unused for decades."

This summary is more accurate and consistent with the information provided in the article.
