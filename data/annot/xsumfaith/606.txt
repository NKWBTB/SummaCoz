    Summary: 
    alexandra palace has started a # 1m fundraising campaign to bring its victorian theatre back to life after lying unused for 80 years. 

    Article: 
    It is hoped the theatre, founded in 1875, will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy and live music.

The theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.
As part of the renovations, the glazed east court will become a space for the public and for exhibitions.
Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) is contributing £18.8m towards the project, while Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m.
The entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of £26.6m.
Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust have committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017.
The theatre, which has languished unused for decades, still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place.
It was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays and all kinds of entertainment, even hosting early cinema screenings. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alexandra Palace has started a #1m fundraising campaign to bring its Victorian theatre back to life after lying unused for 80 years.

2. However, the article states that the theatre has not been used for decades, but it does not mention anything about a fundraising campaign to bring it back to life.

3. Instead, the article states that the theatre is part of a larger east wing restoration project, and that the Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust has committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017.

4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a fundraising campaign to bring the theatre back to life, while the article does not mention any such campaign. Instead, it focuses on the larger restoration project and the funding for it.

5. Additionally, the summary mentions that the theatre has been lying unused for 80 years, which is not accurate according to the article. The article states that the theatre has not been used for decades, but it does not provide a specific time frame.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a fundraising campaign and a specific time frame for the theatre's disuse, neither of which are mentioned in the article.
