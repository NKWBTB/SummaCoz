</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Alexandra Palace has started a #1m fundraising campaign to bring its Victorian theatre back to life after lying unused for 80 years.
2. However, the article states that the theatre has not been unused for 80 years, but has been in use for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music.
3. The article also states that the theatre has been refurbished and repaired, and that the renovations are expected to be completed in 2018.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that the theatre has been lying unused for 80 years is not consistent with the information in the article.
5. Additionally, the summary states that the fundraising campaign is to bring the theatre back to life, implying that the theatre is currently not in use and has been dormant for a long time. However, the article states that the theatre is still in use and has been refurbished, so the fundraising campaign is not necessary to bring the theatre back to life.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the information in the article, as it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations.
