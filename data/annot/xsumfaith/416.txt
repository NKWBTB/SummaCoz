The Garfield Weston Foundation made the award to the Mackintosh Campus Appeal, which aims to raise £32m.
The Mackintosh building was badly damaged by fire on 23 May 2014.
Contractors who are restoring the iconic Grade A-listed art nouveau building hope to have completed their work by the end of February 2019.
Philippa Charles, director of the Garfield Weston Foundation, said: "The Garfield Weston Foundation supports organisations and activities that share a commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of the communities in which they work, and that are driven by a desire to achieve excellence.
"The Glasgow School of Art sits at the heart of the Garnethill community and the people of Glasgow hold the Mackintosh building dear.
"We are delighted to be able to support the Mackintosh Campus Appeal which will enable the GSA to bring this iconic building back as part an extended campus and enable the internationally-renowned Glasgow School of Art to recover fully from the impact of the fire."
The art school announced earlier this year plans to purchase the former Stow College building in nearby West Campbell Street for its expanded Garnethill campus.
The aim is to provide additional space to accommodate a 25% increase in student numbers by 2018.
News of the £500,000 donation emerged as the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, prepared to host an event for the Mackintosh Campus Project at Dover House in London.
Mr Mundell said: "It is a real pleasure to host tonight's fundraising event for the Mackintosh Campus, and to support the rebuilding of an iconic British institution which has produced so many leading architects, designers and artists."
Professor Tom Inns, director of GSA, added: "It is an important opportunity for us to share our ambitious plans for the campus redevelopment, including bringing together all pathways of the School of Fine Art for the first time in many years in a refurbished Stow Building, and to give an update on the restoration of the Mackintosh Building."
After the Mackintosh building blaze, an investigation by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded it was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam.
The report said the gases ignited as they came into contact with the hot surface of a projector.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Mackintosh Campus Appeal aims to raise £32m to restore the Mackintosh building, which was damaged by fire in 2014.
2. The article does not mention anything about the Scottish government giving the go-ahead for the restoration. In fact, the only mention of the government is a quote from the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, who is hosting a fundraising event for the Mackintosh Campus Project in London.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary that the restoration has been given the go-ahead by the Scottish government is not supported by the article.
4. Additionally, the summary states that the Mackintosh building was damaged by a canister of expanding foam, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions that the fire was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam.
5. Finally, the summary does not mention the Garnethill community or the fact that the Glasgow School of Art sits at the heart of the community, which is a key point in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and there are several inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the summary.
