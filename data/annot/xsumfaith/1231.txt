    Summary: 
    health officials from somerset and somerset have announced plans to build a new £33m nhs hospital in somerset. 

    Article: 
    The money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.
Once built, the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.
The current hospital was built in 1813, but it has become cramped and outdated.
The total cost of the project is £33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.
Matron Sue Taylor said: "It's very old and in the summer it's very, very hot. In the winter it's quite cold, there's lots of maintenance, lots of running repairs - it's a poor old tired building now.
"Sometimes your environment can have such an impact when you're trying to recover from an illness - we make the best of what we've got but when you walk into a new build it just lifts you and gives you that feeling of well-being.
"There is a real lovely feel about this hospital and for many years it's served us well, but we need something more modern."
In the past five years, three out of Somerset's 13 community hospitals have been replaced.
Work has also got under way on the new Jubilee Building at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.
Dr Donal Hynes, a Bridgwater GP and medical director at Somerset Primary Care Trust, said: "It will make a huge difference for me and my relationship with my patients.
"This is a great vote of confidence of the developments that have been achieved in Somerset where GPs, nurses, and therapists have got together to deliver a whole package of care that can be delivered in a one-stop shop setting."
Somerset PCT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bowers Lane, which will depend on planning permission.
The aim is to get the hospital finished by autumn 2014. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "health officials from Somerset and Somerset have announced plans to build a new £33m NHS hospital in Somerset." However, the article does not mention anything about health officials from Somerset and Somerset announcing plans to build a new hospital. Instead, the article states that the £33m investment for new NHS facilities across England includes the money for Bridgwater Community Hospital.
2. The summary mentions that the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit, and X-ray and space for mobile scanners. However, the article does not provide this information. Instead, it mentions that the new hospital will have a midwifery-led maternity unit and a minor injury unit, but it does not mention the number of inpatient beds or the other facilities.
3. The summary states that the current hospital was built in 1813 and has become cramped and outdated. However, the article does not mention the age of the current hospital or describe it as cramped and outdated. Instead, it quotes a matron as saying that the current hospital is "very old" and has "lots of maintenance, lots of running repairs."
4. The summary states that the total cost of the project is £33m and that the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. However, the article does not mention the total cost of the project or who will pay for it. Instead, it states that the money for the new hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not mentioned in the article, such as the health officials announcing plans to build a new hospital, the specific facilities that will be included in the new hospital, and the total cost of the project. Additionally, the summary contains some inaccuracies, such as the age of the current hospital and the description of its condition.
