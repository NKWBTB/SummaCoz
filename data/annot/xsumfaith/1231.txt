The money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.
Once built, the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.
The current hospital was built in 1813, but it has become cramped and outdated.
The total cost of the project is £33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.
Matron Sue Taylor said: "It's very old and in the summer it's very, very hot. In the winter it's quite cold, there's lots of maintenance, lots of running repairs - it's a poor old tired building now.
"Sometimes your environment can have such an impact when you're trying to recover from an illness - we make the best of what we've got but when you walk into a new build it just lifts you and gives you that feeling of well-being.
"There is a real lovely feel about this hospital and for many years it's served us well, but we need something more modern."
In the past five years, three out of Somerset's 13 community hospitals have been replaced.
Work has also got under way on the new Jubilee Building at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.
Dr Donal Hynes, a Bridgwater GP and medical director at Somerset Primary Care Trust, said: "It will make a huge difference for me and my relationship with my patients.
"This is a great vote of confidence of the developments that have been achieved in Somerset where GPs, nurses, and therapists have got together to deliver a whole package of care that can be delivered in a one-stop shop setting."
Somerset PCT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bowers Lane, which will depend on planning permission.
The aim is to get the hospital finished by autumn 2014.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "health officials from Somerset and Somerset have announced plans to build a new £33m NHS hospital in Somerset."
2. However, the article states that the money for the new hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England, not a £33m investment specifically from Somerset and Somerset.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the £33m investment is solely from Somerset and Somerset, when in fact it is part of a larger investment from the coalition.
4. Additionally, the summary does not mention the specific features of the new hospital, such as the number of inpatient beds, midwifery-led maternity unit, minor injury unit, and X-ray and space for mobile scanners, which are mentioned in the article.
5. Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and is therefore not a consistent summary of the article's content.
