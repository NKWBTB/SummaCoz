    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Alfreton Town signed defender Joel Mooney from Oldham Athletic on a two-year deal.
2. However, the article states that Mooney joined Alfreton Town from Tranmere Rovers, not Oldham Athletic.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions a different club (Oldham Athletic) than the one (Tranmere Rovers) mentioned in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly mentions Oldham Athletic as the club that Mooney signed from, when in fact he signed from Tranmere Rovers.
