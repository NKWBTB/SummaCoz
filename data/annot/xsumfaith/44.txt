    Summary: 
    a powerful earthquake has struck central italy, killing at least seven people and injuring more than 100. 

    Article: 
    The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said.
The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.
Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.
Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.
Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage.
In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.
In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.
Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.
Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor "came out of nowhere", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - "medium-strong" and "fairly shallow".
Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.
Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.
The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided "inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.
At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.
On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Death toll: The summary states that at least seven people were killed, but the article does not mention any fatalities.
2. Injuries: The summary mentions over 100 injuries, but the article does not mention any injuries or damage.
3. Location: The summary states that the earthquake struck central Italy, but the article specifies that the quake struck 35km north of Lucca, which is not in central Italy.
4. Magnitude: The summary states that the earthquake had a magnitude of 4.8, but the article states that the quake had a magnitude of 6.
5. Damage: The summary mentions that there was no immediate report of injuries or damage, but the article states that several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area, and phone lines were down in the Garfagnana area.
6. Previous earthquakes: The summary mentions that two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead last May, but the article does not mention any previous earthquakes.
7. Scientists' conviction: The summary mentions that six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement before the 2009 earthquake, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the given summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations.
