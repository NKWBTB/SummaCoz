<Article>
UK-based Chatham House says more needs to be done to protect key transport routes such as the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal and the Turkish Straits.
Almost 25% of the world's food is traded on international markets.
This, the report says, makes food supply and prices vulnerable to unforeseen crises or climate change.
Infrastructure at the chokepoints is often old and would struggle to cope with natural disasters which are expected to grow in frequency as the planet warms, the report authors add.
They urge governments to invest in "climate-resilient" infrastructure, and diversify food production and stocks.
The report gives examples of how reliant the world is on this trade:
"The risks are growing as we all trade more with each other and as climate change takes hold," says Laura Wellesley, one of the study's authors.
There are risks for both the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food, she added.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "increasingly reliant on 14 `chokepoints`": The article does mention that the world's food security is reliant on key transport routes such as the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, and the Turkish Straits, but it does not mention the specific number 14. The article mentions that almost 25% of the world's food is traded on international markets, but it does not provide a specific number of chokepoints. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in this regard.
2. "think-tank": The article does not mention the word "think-tank". The report is from Chatham House, a UK-based organization, but the article does not use the term "think-tank" to describe it. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in this regard.
3. "think-tank": This is a repetition of the previous point. The summary uses the term "think-tank" twice, but the article does not use it at all. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in this regard.
4. "warned": The article does mention that the report's authors urge governments to invest in "climate-resilient" infrastructure and diversify food production and stocks, but it does not use the word "warned". Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in this regard.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes specific details that are not present in the article, and it uses terms that are not used in the article.
