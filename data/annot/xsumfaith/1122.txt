    Summary: 
    a day of celebrations has taken place in new zealand to mark the 70th anniversary of the gallipoli landings. 

    Article: 
    Thousands attended the early morning service at Hyde Park Corner and up to 400 people took part in a parade before the wreath-laying at the Cenotaph.
Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.
A service was also held at Westminster Abbey.
The national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung as the service ended.
The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, a year after the Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landings at Gallipoli.
Since then, the services have become an important moment for thousands of expatriate and visiting New Zealanders and Australians, who honour the sacrifices of their countrymen and women in all wars.
Addressing the crowds at the dawn service, Alexander Downer, Australian high commissioner to the UK, who also laid a wreath, said: "When we reflect on Anzac Day we imagine the Gallipoli landings, what it must have been like, at dawn on the water, in sight of that rugged shoreline - and a collectively held breath, a leaden silence about to be broken.
"We consider the enthusiasm, the courage, and the heroism of the Anzac troops - ordinary men fighting for God, King and empire, for their mates, for adventure, for a world without war."
Members of veterans' associations, service and ex-service personal and their families took part in the parade at the Cenotaph.
Crowds, including Australia and New Zealand ex-pats, lined the streets to watch the ceremony which featured prayers read by schoolchildren and the national anthems of all three countries.
The eight-month campaign on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey was one of the bloodiest of the war and the allied operation was an attempt to force the Ottoman empire out of the war. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the celebrations were held to mark the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, but the article does not mention the 70th anniversary. Instead, it states that the celebrations were held to commemorate the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.
2. The summary mentions a parade and wreath-laying at the Cenotaph, but the article does not mention a parade. It only mentions a service at the Cenotaph.
3. The summary states that the national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung, but the article does not mention the national anthems of Australia. It only mentions that the national anthem of New Zealand was sung.
4. The summary mentions King George V attending a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that the first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was in 1916, but it does not specify who attended the service.
5. The summary states that the celebrations were held to honor the sacrifices of Australian and New Zealand soldiers in all wars, but the article only mentions the Gallipoli campaign.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the celebrations were held to mark the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, but the article does not mention the 70th anniversary.
2. The summary states that a day of celebrations has taken place in New Zealand. However, the article states that thousands attended the early morning service at Hyde Park Corner. The article does not mention the celebration is in New Zealand.
