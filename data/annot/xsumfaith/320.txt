<Article>
The "black box" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats.
Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing.
Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit.
An analysis is expected to be released next week.
The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response.
Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace.
Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of "creeping Islamisation".
What we know about how the Su-24 was downed
How Russia's sanctions could hit Turkey
The war of words as it erupted
The two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November.
Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued.
A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground.
Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the Su-24 jet was shot down by F-16 fighters on November 24th, while the summary claims that a Russian jet was shot down in the Syrian capital, Ankara. This is inconsistent as Ankara is not a location in Syria, and the Su-24 was shot down in Syrian airspace, not in Ankara.
2. The article states that both crew members ejected, but the pilot was killed by militants on the ground, while the navigator was rescued. The summary does not mention anything about the crew or their fate.
3. The article mentions that Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey, including a ban on package holidays, in response to the downing of the Su-24. The summary does not mention any sanctions or diplomatic fallout.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains inaccurate information about the location of the incident, the fate of the crew, and the diplomatic fallout.
