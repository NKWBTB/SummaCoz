    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a russian jet has been shot dead by a russian jet jet in the syrian capital, ankara, officials say. 

    Article: 
    The "black box" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats.
Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing.
Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit.
An analysis is expected to be released next week.
The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response.
Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace.
Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of "creeping Islamisation".
What we know about how the Su-24 was downed
How Russia's sanctions could hit Turkey
The war of words as it erupted
The two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November.
Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued.
A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground.
Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that a Russian jet was shot down by a Russian jet in the Syrian capital, Ankara. However, the article does not mention any Russian jets being shot down in Ankara. Instead, it talks about the downing of a Russian Su-24 jet on November 24th, which was shot down by F-16 fighters.
2. The summary mentions that the Russian jet was shot down in the Syrian capital, Ankara, but the article does not support this claim. The article states that the Su-24 was shot down within Syrian airspace, not in Ankara.
3. The summary does not mention the crew members of the Su-24, but the article states that both crew members ejected, and the pilot was killed by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued.
4. The summary does not mention the Russian marine sent to rescue the crew, nor the helicopter that was destroyed on the ground.
5. The summary mentions sanctions imposed by Russia on Turkey, but the article does not mention any specific sanctions.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. It is important to carefully read and understand the information in the article before creating a summary to ensure accuracy and consistency.
