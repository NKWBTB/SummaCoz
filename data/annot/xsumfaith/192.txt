</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the man was arrested on suspicion of raping a 15-year-old girl in Birmingham, but the summary only mentions that a man has been arrested on suspicion of raping a girl in Birmingham without specifying the age of the victim.
2. The article provides more details about the two rapes that occurred in Birmingham, including the location and time of the second rape, but the summary does not mention any of these details.
3. The article mentions that the first rape is being treated as a separate incident, but the summary does not indicate that there were two separate incidents.
4. The article appeals for a Good Samaritan who picked up the victim after she was raped for the second time, but the summary does not mention this appeal.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide all the information mentioned in the article, and it does not accurately convey the details of the two rapes and the police appeal.
