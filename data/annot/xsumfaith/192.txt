A man has been charged and another man arrested in connection with the first attack, which is being treated as a separate incident, the force said.
Meanwhile, detectives continue to appeal for a Good Samaritan who picked up the victim after she was raped for the second time.
Police said the driver of the second vehicle, described as a people carrier-type car, is believed to have given the victim a lift home after she was raped a second time. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of raping a 15-year-old girl in Birmingham.
2. The article states that the man was arrested in connection with the rape of the teenager in a vehicle in the Witton area at around 02:00 BST on 26 July.
3. However, the article also states that the girl had previously been raped at the railway station hours earlier. This is not mentioned in the summary.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the information that the girl was raped at the railway station earlier.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it only mentions one of the two rapes that the man is accused of committing, and leaves out the other rape that occurred at the railway station.
