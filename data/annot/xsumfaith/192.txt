Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the victim was 15 years old, but the summary only mentions "15" without specifying the age. This is an inconsistency because the summary should have included the word "years" to accurately reflect the article.
2. The article also uses the phrase "15-year-old girl" to emphasize the victim's age, but the summary only uses the number "15" without including the word "girl." This is another inconsistency because the summary should have included the word "girl" to match the article's phrasing.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the victim's age and fails to use the correct phrasing to describe the victim. To fix these inconsistencies, the summary should have included the word "years" and the phrase "15-year-old girl" to match the article's language.
