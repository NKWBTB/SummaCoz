It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury.
However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected.
Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later.
He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side.
There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby.
Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "ruled out of the rest of the season",
  "fly-half",
  "england fly-half mako vunipola has been ruled out of the rest of the season after suffering a knee injury",
  "ruled out"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "ruled out of the rest of the season": The article does not mention anything about Mako Vunipola being ruled out for the rest of the season. In fact, it suggests the opposite, that he could be in contention to face Scotland or Ireland.
2. "fly-half": The article does not mention Mako Vunipola's position as fly-half. While he is a scrum-half, there is no mention of his position in the summary.
3. "england fly-half mako vunipola has been ruled out of the rest of the season after suffering a knee injury": The article does not mention that Mako Vunipola has been ruled out for the rest of the season, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, there is no mention of him suffering a knee injury in the article.
4. "ruled out": The article does not use the phrase "ruled out" to describe Mako Vunipola's situation. Instead, it suggests that he could be in contention to face Scotland or Ireland.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies listed above, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary incorrectly states that Mako Vunipola has been ruled out for the rest of the season, and also incorrectly states that he is a fly-half. Additionally, the summary includes information that is not present in the article, such as the phrase "ruled out."
