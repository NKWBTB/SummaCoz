    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    england fly-half mako vunipola has been ruled out of the rest of the season after suffering a knee injury. 

    Article: 
    The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury.
However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected.
Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later.
He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side.
There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby.
Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Mako Vunipola has been ruled out of the rest of the season, but the article states that he could be in contention to face Scotland on March 11 or Ireland a week later. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.

2. The article mentions that Vunipola has been out of action since November with a knee injury, but the summary does not provide any information about the injury or the length of time he will be out. This lack of information suggests that the summary is not supported by the article.

3. The article states that Vunipola has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, which suggests that he is recovering well and could potentially return to international rugby soon. However, the summary does not mention this and instead states that he has been ruled out for the rest of the season, which is not consistent with the article.

4. The article mentions that Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem and came off the bench in the win over Italy. This information is not included in the summary, which suggests that the summary is not a complete representation of the article's content.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important information about Vunipola's recovery and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
