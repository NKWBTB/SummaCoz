<Article>
The 24-year-old, capped 32 times by England, has been out of action since November with a knee injury.
However, it is understood his recovery has progressed quicker than expected.
Vunipola could now be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later.
He was one of England's outstanding performers throughout their unbeaten year of 2016, and his ball-carrying and dynamism has been missed by Eddie Jones' side.
There were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is understood he has looked sharp on his return to full training this week, and is targeting a quick return to international rugby.
Vunipola's older brother, Mako, recently made his own comeback from a knee problem, and came off the bench in the win over Italy.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Vunipola has been out of action since November with a knee injury, but his recovery has progressed quicker than expected.
2. The summary states that Vunipola has been ruled out of the rest of the season.
3. These two statements are contradictory, as the article suggests that Vunipola may be in contention to face Scotland or Ireland, while the summary states that he has been ruled out for the rest of the season.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is likely that the summary is incorrect.
5. The article does not mention anything about Vunipola being ruled out for the rest of the season, so it is likely that the summary is based on incorrect information or a misunderstanding of the article.
