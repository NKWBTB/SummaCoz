    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Novak Djokovic lost to Novak Djokovic, which is not possible as Novak Djokovic is the one who won the match.
2. The article states that the winner of the match was Stan Wawrinka, not Novak Djokovic.
3. The summary mentions that the match was played in the second round of the Chennai Open, but the article states that the match was played in the quarterfinals.
4. The summary does not mention the score of the match, while the article provides the score as 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 6-4 in favor of Stan Wawrinka.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the given summary is not consistent with the article.
