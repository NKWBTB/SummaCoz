</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is from 23rd March 2017, while the summary is talking about former US President Bill Clinton being introduced to the McGuinness family by Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams.
2. The article does not mention anything about Bill Clinton or Gerry Adams.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Bill Clinton or the McGuinness family in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the events described in the summary do not appear in the article. The article does not mention Bill Clinton or Gerry Adams, while the summary mentions them in a specific context.
