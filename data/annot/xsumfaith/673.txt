Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is dated March 23, 2017, while the summary is not specific about the date.

2. The article states that Bill Clinton was introduced to the McGuinness family by Gerry Adams, but the summary does not mention the McGuinness family.

3. The article is written in British English (e.g., "Last updated at 14:55 GMT"), while the summary is written in American English (e.g., "former US president").

4. The article uses the word "Sinn Féin" with a fada (i.e., the diacritical mark above the "e" in "Sinn Féin"), while the summary does not.

Based on these inconsistencies, it appears that the summary was not written based on the article.
