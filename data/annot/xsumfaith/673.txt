    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is from March 2017, but the summary is talking about former US President Bill Clinton being introduced to the McGuinness family by Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams.
2. The article does not mention anything about Bill Clinton or his involvement with the McGuinness family or Sinn Féin.
3. The article is focused on the death of Martin McGuinness, a former IRA leader and former Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, who passed away on March 21, 2017.
4. The article mentions that Bill Clinton was one of the many politicians and world leaders who paid tribute to McGuinness after his death, but it does not mention any personal connection or meeting between Clinton and the McGuinness family.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it claims that Bill Clinton was introduced to the McGuinness family by Gerry Adams, which is not supported by the text of the article.
