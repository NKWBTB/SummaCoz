     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o will be in the cast of Black Panther, but the article does not confirm this. In fact, the article only mentions that Jordan and Nyong'o will be working with the director Ryan Coogler, without mentioning any specific roles.
2. The summary states that Jordan and Nyong'o will be playing roles in Black Panther, but the article only mentions that they will be working with Coogler, without specifying what they will be doing.
3. The summary mentions that Jordan played the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four reboot, but this information is not present in the article.
4. The summary also mentions that Nyong'o played a CGI character in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but this is not mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits other important details that are present in the article.
