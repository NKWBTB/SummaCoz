He told The Hollywood Reporter he was "super excited" and wanted "to put a different spin on it", but did not expand on what role he would play.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "marvel superhero film black panther",
  "marvel superhero film ",
  "b jordan",
  "lupita",
  "michael b"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "marvel superhero film black panther" - The article does not mention the word "black panther" at all. The title of the film is simply "Black Panther", without the word "marvel" or "superhero" in it.
2. "marvel superhero film" - The article only mentions "Black Panther" as a film, without any mention of it being a superhero film.
3. "b jordan" - The article mentions "Michael B. Jordan" as the actor, not "b jordan".
4. "lupita" - The article mentions "Lupita Nyong'o" as the actress, not just "lupita".
5. "michael b" - The article mentions "Michael B. Jordan" as the actor, not just "michael b".

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. The correct summary should be more detailed and accurate, such as:

"Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o will star in the upcoming Marvel film Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler."
