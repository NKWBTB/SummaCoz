</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Michael B. Jordan will be reprising his role as Erik Killmonger in Black Panther.
2. The summary claims that Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o will be in the cast of Black Panther.
3. However, the article does not mention Lupita Nyong'o as being in the cast of Black Panther.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions Lupita Nyong'o as being in the cast, but the article does not support this claim.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it mentions Lupita Nyong'o as being in the cast of Black Panther, but the article does not support this claim.
