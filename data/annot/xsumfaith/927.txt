    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "Britain's Laura Noppert and Lauren Noppert have been ruled out of the women's doubles in Rio on Saturday."
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Laura Noppert or Lauren Noppert being ruled out of the women's doubles in Rio.
3. Instead, the article mentions that Dutch number three seed Noppert will play England's number 10 seed Darryl Fitton in the last four, and that England's Waites, a two-time winner, will face Australia's Corrine Hammond in the women's final.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of Laura Noppert or Lauren Noppert being ruled out of the women's doubles in Rio.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that there is no such information in the article about Laura Noppert and Lauren Noppert being ruled out of the women's doubles in Rio.
