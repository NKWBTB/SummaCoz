[
  "britain\\'s laura noppert and lauren noppert have been ruled out of the women\\'s doubles in rio on saturday"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that Noppert, a Dutch player, will play in the semi-finals, but there is no mention of her being ruled out of the tournament.
2. The summary states that "britain's Laura Noppert and Lauren Noppert have been ruled out of the women's doubles in Rio on Saturday", but there is no mention of either of these players in the article.
3. The article only mentions players who are participating in the tournament, and there is no mention of any players being ruled out.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions players who are not mentioned in the article and implies that they have been ruled out of the tournament, which is not the case.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the spans highlighted in the question are the ones that have consistency issues.
