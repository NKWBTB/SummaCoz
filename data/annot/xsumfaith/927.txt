Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Noppert, a Dutch player, will play in the last four, indicating that she is still in the tournament.
2. The summary states that Noppert and her doubles partner, Lauren Noppert, have been ruled out of the women's doubles.
3. These two statements are contradictory, as Noppert is still in the singles tournament but has been ruled out of the doubles.
