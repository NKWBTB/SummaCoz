    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Manchester City and Chelsea have been charged by the Football Association for failing to control their players during the Premier League game on Saturday.
2. However, the article states that the charge follows a mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1. This implies that the charge is specifically related to the incidents that occurred during the game, rather than a general failure to control players.
3. The article goes on to state that City forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho were sent off, while Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action. This suggests that the charge is related to the actions of these specific players, rather than a failure to control all players.
4. The summary does not mention the specific incidents that led to the charge, such as Aguero's high and late challenge on Chelsea defender David Luiz, or the scuffle that followed. This suggests that the summary is not providing a complete or accurate picture of the events that led to the charge.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not provide a detailed description of the specific incidents that led to the charge, and it does not accurately reflect the nature of the charge.

Overall, it seems that the summary is a general statement about the charge, rather than a detailed description of the specific events that led to the charge. Therefore, it is not consistent with the article.
