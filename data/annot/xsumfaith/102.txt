<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    three former royal navy frigates could be put up for sale in the future, the bbc understands. 

    Article: 
    The decommissioned Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour.
Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships.
The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted.
Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March.
A final decision is not expected until the spring.
The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.
Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard.
She added: "For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life.
"My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction.
"We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism."
The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will "consider all options" for the frigates to ensure "best financial return for the taxpayer".
A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to "commercial sensitivity".
Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems.
They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.
Last year, the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was sold as scrap for Â£3m. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the government's Disposal Services Authority wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. This suggests that the frigates will not be sold as a whole, but rather their parts will be sold separately.

2. The summary states that the frigates could be put up for sale in the future, but there is no mention of the parts being sold separately. This indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not mention the intention to sell the frigates' parts.

3. The article also mentions that the Ministry of Defence will consider all options for the frigates to ensure best financial return for the taxpayer. This suggests that the frigates may be sold for scrap, which is not mentioned in the summary.

4. The summary does not mention the possibility of the frigates being sold for scrap, which is a key detail that is mentioned in the article. This further highlights the inconsistency between the two.

5. Finally, the article mentions that the Type 22 frigates were designed as specialist anti-submarine ships and evolved into powerful surface combatants, which is not mentioned in the summary. This suggests that the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article's contents.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the intention to sell the frigates' parts, the possibility of the frigates being sold for scrap, and the details of the frigates' design and evolution.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that three former royal navy frigates could be put up for sale. However, the article states that Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall were decommissioned. There are four frigates in the article instead of three former royal navy frigates.
