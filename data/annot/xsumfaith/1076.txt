    Summary: 
    a british woman has claimed £70, 000 of cash from a phone scam in stranraer. 

    Article: 
    The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT.
Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet.
He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash.
The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later.
PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.
"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.
"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.
"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a British woman claimed £70,000 from a phone scam in Stranraer, but the article does not mention any such amount. The article only mentions a woman in Stranraer losing money to a caller who claimed to be from BT technical support.
2. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a specific amount of money that was claimed, while the article does not provide any information about the amount of money lost.
3. The article only mentions a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills who was tricked by someone claiming to work for BT, and a woman in Stranraer who lost money to a caller claiming to be from BT technical support. The summary does not mention the Sandyhills incident.
4. The article emphasizes the importance of being cautious when answering cold calls and never giving out banking details or account numbers over the phone. The summary does not mention any such warning.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides incorrect information about the amount of money claimed and does not include the important warning about being cautious when answering cold calls.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a British woman claimed £70,000 from a phone scam in Stranraer, but the article does not mention any such amount. The article only mentions a woman in Stranraer losing money to a caller who claimed to be from BT technical support. 
2. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a specific amount of money that was claimed, while the article does not provide any information about the amount of money lost.
