<Article>
The money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.
Once built, the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.
The current hospital was built in 1813, but it has become cramped and outdated.
The total cost of the project is £33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.
Matron Sue Taylor said: "It's very old and in the summer it's very, very hot. In the winter it's quite cold, there's lots of maintenance, lots of running repairs - it's a poor old tired building now.
"Sometimes your environment can have such an impact when you're trying to recover from an illness - we make the best of what we've got but when you walk into a new build it just lifts you and gives you that feeling of well-being.
"There is a real lovely feel about this hospital and for many years it's served us well, but we need something more modern."
In the past five years, three out of Somerset's 13 community hospitals have been replaced.
Work has also got under way on the new Jubilee Building at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.
Dr Donal Hynes, a Bridgwater GP and medical director at Somerset Primary Care Trust, said: "It will make a huge difference for me and my relationship with my patients.
"This is a great vote of confidence of the developments that have been achieved in Somerset where GPs, nurses, and therapists have got together to deliver a whole package of care that can be delivered in a one-stop shop setting."
Somerset PCT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bowers Lane, which will depend on planning permission.
The aim is to get the hospital finished by autumn 2014.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "go-ahead by the government": The article states that the project has been given the go-ahead by the coalition government, but the summary only mentions "the government" without specifying which government. This inconsistency may be due to the fact that the article is referring to the UK coalition government, while the summary only mentions "the government" in a general sense.
2. "# 150m": The article uses the phrase "£330m investment" to describe the total amount of funding for new NHS facilities across England, but the summary only mentions "£150m" without specifying the currency. This inconsistency may be due to a mistake or an error in translation.
3. "150m": The article uses the phrase "£330m investment" to describe the total amount of funding for new NHS facilities across England, but the summary only mentions "£150m" without specifying the currency. This inconsistency may be due to a mistake or an error in translation.
4. "government": The article refers to the "coalition government" that has given the go-ahead for the project, but the summary only mentions "the government" without specifying which government. This inconsistency may be due to the fact that the article is referring to the UK coalition government, while the summary only mentions "the government" in a general sense.
5. "150": The article does not mention the number "150" anywhere, so this inconsistency may be due to a mistake or an error in translation.

Overall, the inconsistencies in the summary may be due to mistakes or errors in translation, or they may be due to the fact that the summary is not accurately representing the information in the article. It's important to carefully review and fact-check any summaries or translations to ensure that they accurately represent the information in the original source.
