    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that part of the Swansea University campus was evacuated due to the discovery of "unstable chemicals."
2. However, the article states that the evacuation was precautionary and there was no risk to the public.
3. The article also states that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals "had become unstable."
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the precautionary nature of the evacuation or the fact that the controlled explosion was carried out as a precautionary measure.
5. Additionally, the summary does not mention that the chemicals were unstable, which is a key detail in the article.
6. Overall, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article and does not provide a consistent summary of the information provided.
