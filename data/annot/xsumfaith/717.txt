</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the university said the move was "precautionary", indicating that the evacuation was a preventive measure rather than a response to an existing threat.
2. The article mentions that the chemicals were "unstable", which suggests that they were potentially dangerous and could have posed a risk to the public if not handled properly.
3. The article states that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit, which implies that the chemicals were indeed dangerous and required specialized handling.
4. The summary states that the part of the campus was evacuated after the discovery of "unstable chemicals", which is consistent with the article's information.
5. However, the summary does not mention the precautionary nature of the evacuation, nor does it mention the controlled explosion or the involvement of the bomb disposal unit. This is inconsistent with the article's information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and context as the article. Specifically, it does not explain the reason for the evacuation (i.e., the discovery of unstable chemicals) or the measures taken to ensure public safety (i.e., the controlled explosion).
