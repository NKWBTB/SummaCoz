<Summary>
part of a swansea university campus was evacuated on thursday after the discovery of ``unstable\'\'chemicals.
</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "swansea",
  "thursday"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident occurred on Thursday, but the summary only mentions "part of a Swansea university campus" without specifying the day of the week. This inconsistency is because the summary only mentions the location and does not provide the specific day of the incident, which is included in the article.
2. The article mentions that the chemicals "had become unstable," but the summary only uses the phrase "unstable chemicals." This inconsistency is because the summary does not fully convey the reason for the evacuation, which is provided in the article.

Therefore, the two spans that have consistency issues in the summary are "swansea" and "thursday." These issues can be resolved by including the specific day of the week and providing more information about the chemicals, as shown in the article.
