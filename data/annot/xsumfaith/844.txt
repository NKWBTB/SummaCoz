    Summary: 
    it is the word of the longford town of longford town, but it is not enough to know about the future of the longford town. 

    Article: 
    All glass and concrete beside a fast-flowing stream, the Longford Town Centre was to be a cathedral of commerce - now it stands as a monument to the end of the Celtic Tiger and the Republic of Ireland's economic crash and burn.
But local traders believe the bad times are slowly changing.
Matt O'Brien runs a family-owned men's clothing shop in the town centre.
Recent years have been bad - 30% down on the boom - with a member of staff having to be laid off.
But he can now see a turnaround.
"Over the last year we've noticed that business has increased, although it was coming from a low base, but we have improved," he says.
"We've done extra things to try to improve things. We've got into childrenswear and we do a very substantial dress-hire business. We've branched out into other areas, which have helped us."
Fianna FÃ¡il, the main opposition party, is highly critical of how the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is dealing with the midlands, arguing that the half-a-billion euro investment in water meters that won't be operational for several years should instead be spent on broadband improvement.
Its local TD Robert Troy accuses the government of negligence and says a targeted approach is needed for the area.
"The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) haven't brought one potential client to Longford in over four years," he says.
"And if the IDA, which is charged with bringing foreign direct investment to the regions, isn't marketing Longford, isn't showing Longford to potential clients, how then can we expect foreign direct investment to come to Longford?"
But the government says it is doing its bit for County Longford, with the recent announcement that holiday company Center Parcs hopes to employ about 1,000 people at its planned tourism development in Ballymahon in the county when it opens in 2019.
However, the proposed 200m euro (Â£146m) centre in 340 acres of wooded area still has to get planning permission.
Nevertheless, James Bannon, the local Fine Gael TD, is confident the venture will be a success.
He says: "The midlands has some of the finest scenery and watersports that you could avail of anywhere in the world.
"You have the Shannon, just three miles from here you have the River Inny, you have the Royal Canal, you have huge infrastructure here and we're always open for new tourists to come in to this area."
The Center Parcs announcement will not harm the government's chances in next year's expected general election, but traders like Matt O'Brien believe more could be done to boost local business.
"At the moment a lot of people are unhappy at paying for parking on the street," he says.
"Some of our neighbouring towns don't have parking charges. There are issues with the council and if we had free parking it would help bring more people into the town."
So, the message coming from the midlands is that while it, too, is starting to see the beginnings of an economic recovery more still needs to be done.

     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the article is about the future of Longford Town, but the article is actually about the current state of the town and its economic recovery.
2. The summary mentions that the town is "the word of the Longford Town," which is not a correct phrase and does not appear in the article.
3. The summary states that the article is about the future of Longford Town, but the article is actually focused on the current state of the town and the efforts of local traders to boost business.
4. The summary does not accurately capture the main points of the article, which include the struggles of local traders, the government's investment in water meters, and the potential of the Center Parcs development.
5. The summary does not provide any specific examples or quotes from the article to support its claims, while the article includes quotes from local traders and politicians.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately capture the main points of the article, uses incorrect language, and does not provide specific examples or quotes to support its claims.
