    Summary: 
    a collection of art worth more than # 100,000 has been donated to a county durham museum. 

    Article: 
    About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.
But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.
Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.
The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.
Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday.
"Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.
The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.
In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.
Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.
The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.
Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news".
"The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Value of the collection: The summary states that a collection worth over £100,000 has been donated to a county Durham museum, while the article states that the collection was sold for £80,000.
2. Destination of the collection: The summary states that the collection has been donated to a county Durham museum, while the article states that the collection will be loaned to the Wedgwood Museum after being gifted to the Victoria and Albert Museum.
3. Reason for the sale: The summary does not mention the reason for the sale, while the article states that the collection was sold to help pay off the pension debt of Waterford Wedgwood plc.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the value, destination, and reason for the sale of the collection.
