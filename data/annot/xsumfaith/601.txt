It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
More than 5,300 bottles of alcohol were seized by the investigators in the southern city of Liuzhou.
They also found packets of a white powder called Sildenafil, better known as the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
Police in the Guangxi region are now investigating the two distillers.
The Liuzhou Food and Drug Administration said (in Chinese) that the powder was added to three different types of 'baijiu' - a strong, clear spirit that is the most popular drink in China.
They said the haul was worth up to 700,000 yuan (Â£72,000; $113,000).
Doctors recommend that adults requiring prescription should take only one dose of Viagra a day, with a lower dose for those over the age of 65.
China continues to face widespread food safety problems.
In June, police in cities across China seized more than 100,000 tonnes of smuggled meat, some of which was more than 40 years old.
The 2008 tainted milk scandal outraged the nation.
Some 300,000 people were affected and at least six babies died after consuming milk adulterated with melamine.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the investigators found packets of a white powder called Sildenafil, which is better known as Viagra, added to three types of baijiu (a strong, clear spirit) in the southern city of Liuzhou.
2. The article does not mention anything about the distillers telling customers that the baijiu had "health-preserving qualities."
3. The summary states that the distillers told customers the baijiu had "health-preserving qualities." This statement is not supported by the article.
4. The article only mentions that the Liuzhou Food and Drug Administration said that the powder was added to the baijiu, but it does not provide any information about the distillers' claims about the drink's health benefits.
5. Therefore, the statement in the summary that the distillers told customers the baijiu had "health-preserving qualities" is not consistent with the information in the article.

So, the consistency issues in the summary are in the following spans:

[ "told customers it had ``health-preserving qualities\'\'",
 "told customers it had ``health-preserving qualities\'\'," ]

These statements are not supported by the information in the article, and therefore, they are not consistent with the summary.
