Find out why.

<Article>
John Johnston, 27, admitted taking the vehicle without consent and driving while over the legal alcohol limit.
He was spotted by a CCTV operator committing the offence and stopped by police in Buccleuch Street.
At Dumfries Sheriff Court he was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and given the driving ban.
Johnston, who had moved from Belfast to Dumfries, committed the offence in September this year.
He had been staying in homeless accommodation in the town and took the roller from Brooms Road.
He then drove it across town in a bid to get home from a night out drinking with a friend.
"I was just trying to find my way home," he told the court at an earlier appearance.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "pub in dumfries",
  "a pub in dumfries",
  "three years"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "pub in dumfries": The article does not mention a pub in Dumfries. Instead, it states that John Johnston was spotted by a CCTV operator committing the offence and stopped by police in Buccleuch Street. Therefore, the phrase "pub in Dumfries" is not supported by the article.
2. "a pub in dumfries": Similarly, the article does not mention John Johnston going to a pub in Dumfries. He was simply out drinking with a friend when he took the roller without consent and drove it across town.
3. "three years": The article states that John Johnston was given a driving ban, but it does not specify the length of the ban. The summary states that he was banned for three years, but this is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary contains inconsistencies with the article in the following spans:

* "pub in dumfries"
* "a pub in dumfries"
* "three years"

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
