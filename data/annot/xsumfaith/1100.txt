    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    german police say a gunman has been fired at a police station in new york city, killing at least 12 people. 

    Article: 
    Police said that someone opened fire from a passing car and witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired close to the main police station.
"Nothing is known about the culprits yet but we can guess that this involves local crime gangs," investigators told German media.
The suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off.
The shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, as local people enjoyed the Ascension Day holiday in the sunshine. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the gunman fired at a police station in New York City, killing at least 12 people. However, the article does not mention anything about a police station being fired upon or any fatalities.
2. The article states that someone opened fire from a passing car, and witnesses reported up to a dozen shots being fired in a busy area of bars and cafes. This does not match the summary's claim of a gunman firing at a police station.
3. The article also states that the suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off, but the summary does not mention anything about the suspects being caught or the area being cordoned off.
4. The article mentions that investigators believe the incident may involve local crime gangs, but the summary does not mention this detail.

Therefore, based on the differences between the summary and the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains details that are not present in the article, such as the police station being fired upon and fatalities, and omits other details that are present in the article, such as the suspects fleeing and the belief that local crime gangs may be involved.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a gunman fired at a police station in New York City, killing at least 12 people. However, the article does not mention "new york city" or "killing at least 12 people". Instead, the article states that the shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square. No specific death or injury is reported in the article.
