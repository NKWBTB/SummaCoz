<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    one of the world\'s biggest physicists has warned that artificial intelligence could be used in humans. 

    Article: 
    The venture's backers include Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Indian tech giant Infosys and Amazon Web Services.
Open AI says it expects its research - free from financial obligations - to focus on a "positive human impact".
Scientists have warned that advances in AI could ultimately threaten humanity.
Mr Musk recently told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that AI was humanity's "biggest existential threat".
Last year, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially "re-design itself at an ever increasing rate", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution.
However, other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote.
A statement on OpenAI's website said the venture aims "to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return".
"It's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it's equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly."
The statement said AI "should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as is possible safely".
It said only a tiny fraction of the $1bn pledged would be spent in the next few years. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that one of the world's biggest physicists has warned that artificial intelligence could be used in humans.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about physicists or the use of AI in humans.
3. The article focuses on the launch of OpenAI, a new venture that aims to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity without the need for financial return.
4. The article quotes Elon Musk, one of the venture's backers, as saying that AI could be humanity's biggest existential threat, but it also notes that other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote.
5. The article does mention the possibility of AI superseding human evolution, as stated by Stephen Hawking, but this is not the same as using AI in humans.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions the use of AI in humans, which is not a topic discussed in the article.
