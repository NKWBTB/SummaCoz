    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has appeared in court charged with the murder of a father-of-two in county limerick in august. 

    Article: 
    Mr Haugh, 25, was stabbed in a laneway in the Marian estate in the early hours of Sunday.
Robbie Walsh, of Island View, Kilrush, was charged with assault causing serious harm to Mr Haugh.
He has been remanded in custody to appear again in court next week.
Two other men arrested over the killing were released without charge, with files being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.
At Ennis District Court on Tuesday, Det Sgt Padraig Frawley said it will be alleged that Mr Walsh was one of three people who entered the Marian Estate in Kilkee shortly after 01:00 on Sunday and called to houses in the estate looking for Mr Haugh.
Det Frawley said it will be further alleged that while in the estate, the accused and the two males came across Mr Haugh and another man and a fight ensued where weapons were used.
He said: "Other individuals also arrived who became involved in the fight."
Det Frawley said: "During the course of the altercation, Karl Haugh received a stab wound to his back. Garda arrived at the scene where knives and golf clubs were recovered."
He said that Mr Haugh was brought by ambulance to Limerick University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 06:00 local time.
He said police recovered a knife handle and a blade at the scene of Mr Haugh's death and the blade had blood on it.
A judge said the state had given evidence of tension in the area of Kilkee as a result of the killing and remanded Mr Walsh in custody until 14 August. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the accused, Robbie Walsh, was charged with murder, but the article states that he was charged with assault causing serious harm to Mr. Haugh. This is not consistent, as murder is a more serious crime than assault.
2. The summary states that three people entered the Marian Estate looking for Mr. Haugh, but the article only mentions two other men who were arrested and released without charge. This is not consistent, as there should be three people involved in the altercation according to the summary.
3. The summary states that weapons were used during the fight, but the article only mentions knives and golf clubs being recovered at the scene. This is not consistent, as the summary implies that other weapons were used.
4. The summary states that Mr. Haugh was pronounced dead at 6:00 am, but the article states that he was pronounced dead at 1:00 am. This is not consistent, as the time of death is not the same in both accounts.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes more details and a different timeline than the article. It appears that the summary was written based on incomplete or inaccurate information.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the accused was charged with murder, but the article states that he was charged with assault causing serious harm to Mr. Haugh. This is not consistent, as murder is a more serious crime than assault.
2. The summary states that the accused conducted the murder in county limerick in august. However, the article states "Mr Haugh, 25, was stabbed in a laneway in the Marian estate in the early hours of Sunday". The article does not mention the location being county limerick nor the time being August.
3. The summary mentions "a father-of-two". However, the article does not mention the victim as "a father-of-two".
