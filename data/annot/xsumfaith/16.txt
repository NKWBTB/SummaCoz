<Article>
London 2012 Olympian Andrew Lawrence scored 14 points while NBA player Ben Gordon added 13.
Coach Joe Prunty's team led for most of the first three quarters before being overhauled by their guests in the last 10 minutes of a well-contested game.
GB now begin their Eurobasket qualifying campaign with a game in Hungary in midweek.
"The key to the qualifiers will be completing on every play. We have to make sure that we're going as hard as we can on both ends of the floor," Prunty told BBC Sport.
"I think at times tonight we lost a little of our fire."
Prunty turned to his strongest line-up in the final warm-up match before he cuts the roster for the six-game qualifying programme.
GB led 35-24 on Lawrence's three in the second quarter but the Dutch took the lead early in the third. Gordon then hit three threes in a row - his first points of the game - to restore GB's advantage.
Netherlands, who were led by 18 points from Worthy De Jong, scored the first 10 points of the fourth quarter to lead 71-60 and held on to win despite the hosts' comeback in the last six minutes.
Prunty was pleased with the contribution of Gordon, a player who has joined the team despite missing out on the place available to him for London 2012.
He said: "You're always trying to find to your rhythm as a player and with one another. I thought he [Gordon] had a good showing tonight, he certainly had a very good stretch in the third quarter."

great britain\'s men lost their opening eurobasket finals warm-up warm-up match against the netherlands in amsterdam.
</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "great britain\\'s",
  "finals",
  "opening",
  "amsterdam"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "great britain's" - The article never uses the possessive form "great britain's" to refer to the team. Instead, it uses "GB" or "Great Britain" without the possessive form. Therefore, the summary should not have used "great britain's" in the first place.
2. "finals" - The article is discussing a warm-up match, not a final. The correct word should be "warm-up" or "preparatory match", not "finals".
3. "opening" - The article does not mention that the match was the opening match of any kind. Therefore, the word "opening" is not appropriate here.
4. "amsterdam" - The article does not mention the location of the match as "Amsterdam". Instead, it mentions "Hungary" as the location of the next game. Therefore, the word "Amsterdam" is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary should have read:

"Great Britain's men lost their preparatory match against the Netherlands."

This is a more accurate and consistent representation of the article's content.
