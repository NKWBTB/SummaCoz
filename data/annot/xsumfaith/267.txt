</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "has signed a new contract",
  "wicketkeeper",
  "signed a new contract"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "has signed a new contract": The article states that Buttler has extended his contract with Lancashire, not the Indian Premier League (IPL) side. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "wicketkeeper": The article does not mention Buttler's position as a wicketkeeper. While he does keep wickets, the article does not emphasize this aspect of his game. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
3. "signed a new contract": The article states that Buttler has extended his contract with Lancashire, not signed a new one. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, primarily due to the incorrect information about Buttler's contract and position.
