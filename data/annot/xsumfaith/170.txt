<Article>
The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property."

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention the woman's death.
4. The article only mentions that the fire is not thought to be suspicious and that the damage caused has prevented entry to the property, but it does not mention the woman's death.
5. The summary is not supported by the article, as the article does not provide any information about the woman's death.
6. The summary is likely based on incorrect or incomplete information, as it does not match the content of the article.
