Find out why.

<Article>
The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "woman has died",
  "died",
  "highlands"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "woman has died" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention the woman's death. Instead, it states that the emergency services were called to the property and that the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
2. "died" - This statement is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of the woman dying in the article. The article only states that the emergency services were called to the property and that the fire was not thought to be suspicious.
3. "highlands" - This statement is consistent with the article, as the article does mention the location of the fire as the Sangomore area of Durness in the highlands.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues because it contains statements that are not supported by the article. The article does not mention the woman's death, and the damage caused by the fire has prevented entry to the property, but the summary states that the woman has died.
