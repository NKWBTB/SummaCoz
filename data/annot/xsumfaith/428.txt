<Article>
The venture's backers include Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Indian tech giant Infosys and Amazon Web Services.
Open AI says it expects its research - free from financial obligations - to focus on a "positive human impact".
Scientists have warned that advances in AI could ultimately threaten humanity.
Mr Musk recently told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that AI was humanity's "biggest existential threat".
Last year, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially "re-design itself at an ever increasing rate", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution.
However, other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote.
A statement on OpenAI's website said the venture aims "to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return".
"It's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it's equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly."
The statement said AI "should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as is possible safely".
It said only a tiny fraction of the $1bn pledged would be spent in the next few years.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "ai weiwei, the founder of ai giant ai weiwei, has launched a $1m research project." This statement is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of an individual named "ai weiwei" or an "ai giant" in the article.
2. The article mentions that OpenAI, a venture backed by Elon Musk and other tech companies, has pledged $1 billion for AI research. The summary does not mention OpenAI or any of the other companies mentioned in the article.
3. The summary mentions a $1 million research project, which is a much smaller amount than the $1 billion pledged by OpenAI.
4. The article states that OpenAI's research will be "free from financial obligations" and will focus on having a "positive human impact." The summary does not mention any of these goals or objectives.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the OpenAI venture or its goals, and it mentions a much smaller amount of funding than the $1 billion pledged by OpenAI.
