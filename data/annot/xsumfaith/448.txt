</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the man, Adrian Fatchett, died on Saturday night despite being treated at the scene by paramedics.
2. The summary does not mention the man's death. Instead, it only states that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. Specifically, the article states that the man died, while the summary does not mention his death.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary only mentions the arrest of a man on suspicion of murder, but it does not mention the man's death, which is a key piece of information in the article.
