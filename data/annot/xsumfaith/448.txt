    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was stabbed to death in south yorkshire. 

    Article: 
    Adrian Fatchett, 52, was injured at a house in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South, said South Yorkshire Police.
Mr Fatchett died on Saturday night despite being treated at the scene by paramedics, officers said.
A 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murder has been bailed and investigations continue, said police. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was arrested on suspicion of murder, but the article does not mention any arrest. Instead, it states that a 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder, but he has since been bailed.
2. The summary mentions that the man was stabbed to death, but the article does not mention any stabbing. Instead, it states that Adrian Fatchett died after being injured at a house in Highfield Avenue.
3. The summary does not mention the location of the incident, but the article states that the incident occurred in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions an arrest and a stabbing, neither of which are mentioned in the article.
