</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Private Derby XXX was promoted to the rank of lance corporal at an event in Chester, but the summary claims that the event was held in Wiltshire. This is a contradiction, as the two locations are not the same.
2. The article mentions that the event was held to mark eight years of the Mercian Regiment, but the summary does not mention this detail.
3. The article states that Private Derby XXX was awarded his promotion for "good behaviour", but the summary does not mention this reason. Instead, it simply states that the centenary of the Christmas Truce between the Isle of Man has been unveiled.
4. The article provides information about Private Derby XXX's background and career, including his joining the regiment in February 2014 and his involvement in various events, but the summary does not include any of this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains contradictory information and omits important details.
