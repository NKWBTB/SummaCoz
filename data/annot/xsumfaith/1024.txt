    Article: 
    KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol.
Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) said the flights would allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home.
It is the latest addition from KLM since it started Inverness-Amsterdam flights last year. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol.
2. The article does not mention anything about flights from Inverness to Heathrow Airport.
3. The summary states that a flight from Inverness to Heathrow Airport has caused more flights to and from the Highlands.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of a flight from Inverness to Heathrow Airport in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it mentions a flight that does not exist in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The article does not mention anything about flights from Inverness to Heathrow Airport.
2. The summary states that a flight from Inverness to Heathrow Airport has caused more flights to and from the Highlands.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of a flight from Inverness to Heathrow Airport in the article.
