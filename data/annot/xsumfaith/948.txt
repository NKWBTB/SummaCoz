    Summary: 
    police are appealing for witnesses after a man was attacked and robbed by a group of staff in londonderry. 

    Article: 
    The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday.
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was attacked and robbed by a group of staff, while the article states that the suspects were two men. The article does not mention any group of staff attacking the victim. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

2. The summary mentions that the attackers were staff, which is not supported by the article. The article states that the suspects were two men, not staff.

3. The summary does not mention any details about the suspects, such as their age, appearance, or weapons used, which are all mentioned in the article.

4. The article states that the victim was "badly shaken but otherwise unharmed," while the summary does not mention the victim's condition.

5. The article mentions that police are carrying out door-to-door inquiries and collecting CCTV images, which is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and may not accurately reflect the events described in the article.
