<Article>
The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday.
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the incident occurred in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, while the summary states that the incident occurred in Londonderry. This is inconsistent, as Londonderry is a city located in Northern Ireland, while Quarrywood Avenue is a location in Sheffield, England.
2. The article describes the suspects as white and provides a physical description of one of them, while the summary does not mention the suspects' race or physical appearance.
3. The article states that the victim was threatened with a knife and that the suspects demanded money, while the summary does not mention a knife or any demands for money.
4. The article mentions that police are carrying out door-to-door inquiries and collecting CCTV images, while the summary does not mention any police investigation or efforts to identify the suspects.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details, misrepresents others, and changes the location of the incident.
