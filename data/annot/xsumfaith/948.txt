<Article>
The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday.
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is set in Quarrywood Avenue, Barmulloch, and the suspects are described as white and one of them is about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
2. The summary states that the incident occurred in "londonderry", which is a different location entirely.
3. The article does not mention any group of staff attacking or robbing anyone. Instead, it reports that two men entered the Post Office, threatened a member of staff with a knife, and demanded money.
4. Therefore, the summary contains inconsistencies with the article in the following spans:
	* "was attacked and robbed by a group of staff in londonderry" (no group of staff is mentioned in the article)
	* "londonderry" (the article is set in Quarrywood Avenue, Barmulloch, not londonderry)

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and the inconsistencies may indicate that the summary was not written based on the article.
