Daniel Timbers, 29, and Barry Joy, 56, were working at Harford Attachments in Spar Road when they were killed, shortly after 09:00 BST on Monday.
The men are believed to have been working in a paint-spraying area.
Their bodies were removed from the site on Tuesday afternoon.
A forensic search has been carried out at the company, which makes buckets for diggers.
Det Ch Insp Paul Durham said "significant progress" had been made with forensic inquiries and obtaining witness statements.
"Evidence gathered so far suggests there has been a flashover explosion, which occurs when you have a build-up of toxic fumes," he said.
"This, combined with some sort of ignition, has caused a fire-ball effect."
The Health and Safety Executive said its inspectors and electrical safety experts would be gathering evidence.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that two men, Daniel Timbers and Barry Joy, were killed in a workplace explosion at Harford Attachments in Spar Road, County Durham.
2. The summary states that two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was killed in a road accident in County Durham.
3. The article does not mention anything about a road accident or a murder investigation. Instead, it focuses on the explosion at Harford Attachments and the subsequent forensic search and witness statements.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a road accident and murder investigation, while the article only mentions a workplace explosion.

Overall, the summary is not accurate because it does not reflect the content of the article. The article does not mention any arrests, murders, or road accidents, so the summary is not consistent with the information provided in the article.
