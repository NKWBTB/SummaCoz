<Article>
The Sorrento was travelling to the coastal city of Valencia when the blaze began and quickly got out of control.
The passengers were evacuated from the burning ship on to lifeboats and have been rescued by another ship.
At least three people have been injured and have been taken to hospital by helicopter, Spanish media say. One is reported to be seriously hurt.
The ship was about 27km (17 miles) from Mallorca when the fire broke out on Tuesday afternoon on one of the car decks. The reason for the fire was unclear.
Several ships including two passenger ferries were sent to help. The passengers and crew on the life rafts eventually boarded one of the ferries, the Puglia.
Spanish officials said the rescued passengers were on their way back to Palma de Mallorca and were expected to arrive at the port in a few hours' time. Psychologists were being asked to go to the port to provide counselling.
"Due to the fire that it has suffered, The Sorrento may sink in the position in which it finds itself," the Balearic Islands port authority said in a tweet (in Spanish).
The ferry, owned by Italian company Atlantica di Navigazione, sent out distress signals at 13:50 local time (11:50 GMT), said Spain's Ministry of Public Works.
At first, the ministry said the captain did not believe it would be necessary to abandon the ship but the fire became so intense that a full evacuation was called for.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the ferry was travelling from the coastal city of Valencia to Mallorca when the fire broke out, but the summary only mentions that the ferry is from Mallorca. This is inconsistent, as the article clearly states that the ferry was not originating from Mallorca.
2. The article states that at least three people were injured and taken to hospital by helicopter, but the summary does not mention any injuries or casualties. This is inconsistent, as the article mentions that there were at least three people injured and taken to hospital.
3. The article states that the passengers and crew were evacuated onto lifeboats and then rescued by another ship, but the summary only mentions that they had to abandon ship. This is inconsistent, as the article provides more detail about the evacuation process.
4. The article states that the reason for the fire is unclear, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the article provides more information about the situation but the summary does not.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details and provides inaccurate information.
