    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the fire was at a derelict building in Newport, but the article does not mention any derelict building. Instead, it states that the fire was at a building site in Bloomery Circle, Llanwern. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary mentions that police are investigating the fire, which is correct according to the article. However, the article does not mention any specific details about the investigation, such as the fact that the fire is believed to have been deliberately set.
3. The summary mentions that the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers, but the article does not mention this detail. The article only states that the fire burned for more than 10 hours before it was extinguished, without providing any information about the type of materials that were burning.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
