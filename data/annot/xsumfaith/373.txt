</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the fire occurred in Bloomery Circle, Llanwern, which is not the same location as a derelict building in Newport. The summary incorrectly states that the fire occurred in a derelict building in Newport.
2. The article mentions that the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The article states that the fire is believed to have been deliberately set, which is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the location of the fire, omits important details about the burning material, and fails to mention the suspicion of arson.
