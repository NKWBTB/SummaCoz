</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "newport",
  "derelict"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the fire occurred in Bloomery Circle, Llanwern, but the summary mentions "newport". This is inconsistent because "newport" is not mentioned in the article.
2. The article describes the burning material as "a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers", but the summary mentions "derelict building". This is inconsistent because the article does not mention any derelict buildings.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two inaccuracies: the location and the type of building involved in the fire.
