    Summary: 
    british and irish lions coach robin mcbryde has been named as the new coach of the welsh rugby union. 

    Article: 
    Head coach Warren Gatland is leading the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand and has named interim coach Rob Howley as part of his backroom team.
Forwards coach McBryde assumes head coach responsibilities for the third time after leading Wales on tours in 2009 and 2013.
"It is an honour to represent your country and to do so overseas carries extra responsibility," said McBryde.
"For me it is another exciting opportunity to lead the team.  It is something I have thoroughly enjoyed in the past and I'm really looking forward to doing it again at the end of the season."
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) will appoint assistant coaches for the summer tour to assist McBryde.
"We are also at an advanced stage in discussions with a number of other individuals about the summer tour and hope to be in a position to confirm the full make-up of the management team next week," said WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips.
Union chairman Gareth Davies, who is also on the Lions' selection panel, believes the involvement of Welsh coaches will benefit the national team.
"2017 is a real summer of opportunity for Welsh coaches and should benefit the whole of Welsh rugby in the years ahead," he said.
"It is not often that you get the opportunity to develop coaches in different environments.
"Our coaches and players have been invigorated by their Lions experiences on previous campaigns and there is little doubt that a tour of New Zealand will provide the ultimate test and so once again both mentally stimulate and inspire each individual." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that British and Irish Lions coach Robin McBryde has been named as the new coach of the Welsh rugby union.

However, the article does not mention anything about McBryde being named as the new coach of the Welsh rugby union. Instead, it mentions that he will be leading the Welsh team on a tour as the forwards coach.

2. The article states that McBryde has been appointed as the forwards coach for the Welsh team's summer tour.

The summary is incorrect in stating that McBryde has been named as the new coach of the Welsh rugby union. The article does not provide any information that would support this claim.

3. The summary also states that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) will appoint assistant coaches for the summer tour to assist McBryde.

This information is not present in the article. The article only mentions that the WRU is in discussions with other individuals about the summer tour, but it does not mention anything about appointing assistant coaches.

4. The article does state that McBryde has previously led the Welsh team on tours in 2009 and 2013, and that he is looking forward to doing so again at the end of the season.

However, the summary does not accurately reflect this information. Instead, it states that McBryde has been named as the new coach of the Welsh rugby union, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reasons for this inconsistency are:

* The summary incorrectly states that McBryde has been named as the new coach of the Welsh rugby union, when the article only mentions that he will be leading the Welsh team on a tour as the forwards coach.
* The summary does not accurately reflect the information about the WRU appointing assistant coaches for the summer tour, as this information is not present in the article.

I hope this helps clarify the reasons why the summary is not consistent with the article! Let me know if you have any further questions.
