    Summary: 
    wales \'natural resources wales ( nrw ) has accused the uk government of " unrealistic " plans for a tidal lagoon in swansea bay. 

    Article: 
    Earlier this month, NRW estimated the lagoon would mean 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, as they migrate to and from local rivers.
Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) said the claims had no "clear scientific basis".
NRW said its figures were based on the "best available evidence" it received.
In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them.
"Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication," the briefing said.
"These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish]," the briefing adds.
TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a "worst case scenario" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish.
The Â£1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast, including Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay.
UK government ministers are considering the findings of a six-month review of the viability of the scheme, which is yet to be published.
Wales' Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government was "very supportive" of the scheme.
But she said both it and the industry needed clarity on the UK government's position in the "very, very near future."
NRW said it strongly disagreed with TLP's criticism, which it was "very surprised and disappointed by".
Gareth O'Shea, an NRW executive director, said: "We have received a vast amount of evidence on this subject from the applicant and have held detailed discussions with the developer for a year-and-a-half where we have shared a huge amount of information, data and our methodology.
"This has been assessed by independent experts and our own technical experts, and we have the utmost confidence that it is the best evidence available to enable us to make the right decision for the environment in Wales, as we are legally bound to do." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that NRW has accused the UK government of having "unrealistic" plans for the tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay.
2. However, the article states that NRW's figures for the impact of the lagoon on fish are based on "what if" scenarios and have no "clear scientific basis".
3. The article also states that TLP disputes NRW's figures and claims that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them.
4. Furthermore, the article states that TLP's own computer modelling estimates a "worst case scenario" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish, which is significantly lower than NRW's estimates.
5. Therefore, based on the information in the article, it appears that NRW's claims about the UK government's plans for the tidal lagoon are not supported by scientific evidence.
6. Additionally, the article states that TLP is viewing the Swansea tidal lagoon project as a test bed for larger and more cost-effective versions around the coast, which suggests that the project is not just about the Swansea Bay location.
7. Finally, the article states that the Welsh Government is "very supportive" of the scheme, but needs clarity on the UK government's position "in the very, very near future".

Therefore, based on the information in the article, it appears that NRW's claims about the UK government's plans for the tidal lagoon are not supported by scientific evidence, and the project is being viewed as a test bed for larger and more cost-effective versions around the coast. The Welsh Government is supportive of the scheme, but needs clarity on the UK government's position.
