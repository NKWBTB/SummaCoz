Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the John Deere tractor was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley, and that the vehicle had been seen in nearby Harrogate without headlights on. This suggests that the tractor was being driven on a public road.
2. The article also states that the driver had no licence, was not insured, and did not have permission from the tractor's owner. This further suggests that the driver was not authorized to operate the tractor on a public road.
3. The article quotes Insp Chris Galley as saying that the 15-year-old driver was taking his drunk friends for a ride in the tractor. This implies that the driver was using the tractor as a form of transportation, rather than for its intended purpose as a farm vehicle.
4. The summary states that a tractor driver has been arrested on suspicion of driving a tractor on a tractor in county antrim. This statement is not consistent with the information in the article, as there is no mention of the driver being arrested for driving a tractor on a tractor. Instead, the driver was arrested for driving the tractor on a public road without a license, insurance, or permission.
5. Additionally, the phrase "on a tractor" is repeated twice in the summary, which is not necessary and makes the statement sound awkward.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the phrasing in the summary is not clear or accurate.
