    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the tractor driver was arrested on suspicion of driving a tractor on a tractor, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the driver being arrested for driving a tractor on a tractor.
2. The article states that the driver was pulled over by officers in the village of Ripley and had two other males on board. The summary does not mention anything about the other males on board the tractor.
3. The article states that the driver had no licence, was not insured, and did not have permission from the tractor's owner. The summary does not mention any of these details.
4. The article mentions that the vehicle was seized, and the three individuals were to be interviewed by officers. The summary does not mention anything about the vehicle being seized or the individuals being interviewed.
5. The article includes a quote from Insp Chris Galley, which is not included in the summary.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
