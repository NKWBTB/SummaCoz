    Summary: 
    a oil company has said it is " extremely concerned " about the health of six workers who were exposed to radioactive radiation at a north sea platform. 

    Article: 
    The incident happened on EnQuests's Thistle platform, off Shetland, last December.
Rigging supervisor Steve Innes, from Sunderland, told the BBC he and fellow Wood Group contractors discovered they had been exposed to alpha radiation.
EnQuest said "additional precautionary steps" had since been taken.
Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety.
Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing.
He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care.
The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment.
Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip.
He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped.
He said: "We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear.
"At first we were all in shock.
"We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time."
He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm, but he was continuing to undergo tests.
Mr Innes said of EnQuest: "They have a duty of care. Their procedures have broken down.
"You can't say 'you've been contaminated but we think you'll be OK'.
"I would like somebody to take the case on who's not frightened of the companies."
An EnQuest spokesperson said: "EnQuest can confirm that, in December 2016, during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform, six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest were removing a piece of pipework when they were exposed to low levels of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material).
"The level of exposure was less than 1% of the level at which it is reportable to the Health and Safety Executive however EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter at the time.
"EnQuest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NORM.
"Following an investigation, additional precautionary steps have been taken to further ensure that personnel avoid any such exposure."
A Wood Group spokeswoman said: "The health and safety of our people is always our top priority.
"As a precaution following the incident, we downmanned our employees from the platform in order to conduct medical assessments.
"We fully supported EnQuest in a detailed joint investigation and continue to reinforce the application of our health and safety procedures, to ensure the safety of our employees.
"Our commitment and priority following the incident and throughout the investigation has been to the health and wellbeing of our employees."
John Boland, regional officer for the Unite union, said: "Unite believes that the way these workers has been treated is terrible.
"It's vital for workers' safety that there is openness and transparency about serious safety incidents, so that we can learn lessons and create a safer working environment for everyone offshore."
A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said: "HSE has been made aware of this incident.
"However, it was not reportable under the present RIDDOR system (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) and no staff raised the issue with HSE separately so no investigation has been carried out." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify the inconsistency in the summary and the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

Step 1: Identify the main points in the summary
The summary states that an oil company is "extremely concerned" about the health of six workers who were exposed to radioactive radiation at a North Sea platform. The workers were exposed to alpha radiation, and the company has taken additional precautionary steps to ensure the safety of its employees.

Step 2: Identify the main points in the article
The article reports that six workers were exposed to low levels of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) during shutdown activities on EnQuest's Thistle platform in December 2016. The workers were employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest. The level of exposure was less than 1% of the reportable level to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter, and the company took additional precautionary steps to prevent further exposure.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistency
The inconsistency lies in the language used in the summary and the article. The summary states that the company is "extremely concerned" about the health of the workers, while the article states that EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter and took additional precautionary steps to prevent further exposure. The language used in the summary implies a higher level of concern and urgency than the language used in the article.

Step 4: Analyze the reason for the inconsistency
The inconsistency likely arises from the fact that the article is a news report, while the summary is a statement from the company. The company's statement may have been crafted to present a more urgent and concerned tone to the public, while the article provides a more factual account of the incident.

In conclusion, the inconsistency between the summary and the article lies in the language used to describe the company's response to the incident. The summary presents a more urgent tone, while the article provides a more factual account of the incident and the company's response.
