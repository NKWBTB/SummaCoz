</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that MacDonald signed for Torquay in 2014, but the summary says he signed for Torquay United. This is a inconsistency, as there is no Torquay United club mentioned in the article.
2. The article mentions that MacDonald played for Reading and Wimbledon, but the summary makes no mention of these clubs. This is another inconsistency, as the article provides information about MacDonald's previous clubs that is not included in the summary.
3. The article states that MacDonald is a defender, but the summary does not mention his position. This is a minor inconsistency, but it could be important if the summary is intended to provide a brief summary of MacDonald's footballing abilities or role in the team.
4. Finally, the article mentions that the transfer is a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee, but the summary makes no mention of the length of the deal or the transfer fee. This is a significant inconsistency, as the article provides specific information about the terms of the transfer that is not included in the summary.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important information about MacDonald's previous clubs, his position, and the terms of the transfer.

###Corrected:
1. The article mentions that MacDonald played for Reading and Wimbledon, but the summary makes no mention of these clubs. This is another inconsistency, as the article provides information about MacDonald's previous clubs that is not included in the summary.
