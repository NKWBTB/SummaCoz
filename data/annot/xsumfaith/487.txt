The victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury at about 02:15 GMT on Friday when the assault occurred.
Investigating officers said three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people.
It is believed one of the group then set light to the woman's hair.
Officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack.
Det Sgt Barry Carr said: "Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse.
"This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. Inconsistency in the number of perpetrators:
The article states that "three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people." However, the summary states that police have released CCTV images of "two men" they want to speak to in connection with the assault. This is an inconsistency in the number of perpetrators mentioned in the two sources.
2. Inconsistency in the use of the word "serious":
The article describes the assault as "nasty and extremely dangerous," implying that it was a serious incident. However, the summary only describes the incident as a "serious assault," which is a less severe term. This inconsistency in language suggests that the summary may not accurately reflect the severity of the incident.

Overall, these inconsistencies suggest that the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content, and may not accurately reflect the information presented in the article.
