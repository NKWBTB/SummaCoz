    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that police have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to in connection with a serious assault in St George.

2. However, the article states that three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people, and one of the group then set light to the woman's hair.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions two men, while the article states that three men were involved in the assault.

4. Additionally, the summary does not mention the fact that one of the men set light to the woman's hair, which is a significant detail that is included in the article.

5. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article and does not provide a consistent summary of the information provided.
