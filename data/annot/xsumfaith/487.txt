Find out why.

<Article>
The victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury at about 02:15 GMT on Friday when the assault occurred.
Investigating officers said three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people.
It is believed one of the group then set light to the woman's hair.
Officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack.
Det Sgt Barry Carr said: "Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse.
"This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people."
2. The summary states that police have released CCTV images of "two men" they want to speak to.
3. The article does not mention anything about two men, only three men.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions two men when the article states three men were involved in the assault.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is because it incorrectly states that police are looking for two men when the article clearly states that there were three men involved in the assault.
