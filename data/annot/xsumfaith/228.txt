]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Craig Peacock fired the hosts into a ninth minute lead." This implies that the home team, Manchester Storm, scored the first goal.
2. However, the summary states that "manchester storm missed out on a place in the elite league play-offs after beating manchester storm." This is inconsistent with the article, as it suggests that Manchester Storm did not miss out on a place in the playoffs, but rather they scored a goal against themselves.
3. The article also states that Manchester Storm scored a goal three minutes after the hosts took the lead, so it is unlikely that they missed out on a place in the playoffs.
4. Additionally, the article mentions that Storm moved in front six seconds before the end of the second period with Luke Salazar finishing an excellent move, which further suggests that Manchester Storm was the winning team.
5. Finally, the article mentions that Matthew Davies scored an empty net goal in the final minute, which sealed the win for Manchester Storm.

Therefore, the inconsistency in the summary is that it states that Manchester Storm missed out on a place in the playoffs, which is not supported by the article. The article actually suggests that Manchester Storm won the game.
