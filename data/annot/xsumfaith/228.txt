    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Manchester Storm missed out on a place in the elite league play-offs, but the article does not mention anything about play-offs.
2. The summary mentions that Manchester Storm beat Manchester Storm, but there is no team called Manchester Storm in the article. The article only mentions Manchester and Storm.
3. The summary states that Luke Salazar finished an excellent move to put Storm ahead six seconds before the end of the second period, but the article does not mention Luke Salazar or any goal scored by Storm during the second period.
4. The summary mentions a short-handed empty net goal from Matthew Davies in the final minute, but the article does not mention any short-handed goals or empty net goals.

Based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article. Therefore, the summary is not a reliable representation of the content of the article.
