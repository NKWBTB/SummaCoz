Find out why.

<Article>
Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.
So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it.
Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online.
The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.

<Summary>
scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the team is sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it to explore the Mariana Trench.
2. The purpose of the expedition is to explore the trench and look for things like fish, mud volcanoes, and deep sea coral.
3. The article mentions that the team has already spotted shrimp, jellyfish, and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.
4. The summary, on the other hand, simply states that scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration.
5. There is no mention of the specific expedition or the findings in the summary, which suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.
6. Therefore, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it does not provide any specific information about the expedition or the findings, but rather just a general statement about scientists taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration.
