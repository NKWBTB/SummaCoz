<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.
So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it.
Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online.
The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.

<Summary>
scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "scientists are taking pictures",
  "scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration",
  "scientists"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it to explore the Mariana Trench.
2. The purpose of the expedition is to look for things like fish, mud volcanoes, and deep sea coral.
3. So far, the team has spotted shrimp, jellyfish, and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.
4. The summary states that "scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration."
5. However, the article does not mention anything about scientists taking pictures. Instead, it mentions that the team is sending down a robotic submarine with a camera to explore the trench.
6. Therefore, the phrase "scientists are taking pictures" is not supported by the article, as it is the team that is sending down the submarine with a camera, not scientists.
7. Similarly, the phrase "scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration" is also not consistent with the article, as the team is exploring the trench with the submarine, not scientists.
8. Finally, the word "scientists" is also not consistent with the article, as the team is sending down the submarine, not scientists.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues in the phrases "scientists are taking pictures", "scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration", and "scientists".
