    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    scientists are taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration. 

    Article: 
    Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is.
So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it.
Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online.
The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral.
So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions "scientists taking pictures of deep-sea underwater exploration," which is not accurate. The article does not mention anything about scientists taking pictures, but rather a team sending down a robotic submarine with a camera to explore the deep sea.
2. The summary mentions "sea life," which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions the team looking for "things like fish, mud volcanoes, and deep sea coral."
3. The summary mentions "shrimp, jellyfish, and black pillow lava," which are not mentioned in the article as being part of the expedition's findings. The article only mentions "shrimp" as one of the things the team has spotted so far.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article and omits information that is present in the article.
