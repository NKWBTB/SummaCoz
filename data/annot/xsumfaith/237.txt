    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a woman jailed for two years for stealing more than £200, 000 from a dumfries and galloway pensioner has lodged an appeal against her 

    Article: 
    Wanda Campbell, 43, of Auchenmalg near Newton Stewart, was jailed for three years earlier this month.
She was also ordered to pay compensation of £110,000 at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
Her appeal against that sentence and the conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh.
She was found guilty after a seven-day trial of acting with others to take the money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman was jailed for two years, while the article states that she was jailed for three years. This is a inconsistency.

2. The summary mentions that the woman was ordered to pay compensation of £110,000, but the article does not mention this. This is another inconsistency.

3. The article states that the woman's appeal against the sentence and conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
