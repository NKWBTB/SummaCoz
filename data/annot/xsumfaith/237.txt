</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Wanda Campbell was jailed for three years, not two years as stated in the summary.
2. The article mentions that Campbell was ordered to pay compensation of £110,000, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article states that Campbell's appeal against the sentence and conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it:

* Incorrectly states the length of Campbell's sentence.
* Omits the fact that Campbell was ordered to pay compensation.
* Omits the fact that Campbell's appeal will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh.

These inconsistencies suggest that the summary was not accurately based on the article and may have been incorrect or incomplete.
