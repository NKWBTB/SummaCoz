</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "dumfries and galloway pensioner",
  "stealing more than \u00a3200, 000 from a dumfries and galloway pensioner has lodged an appeal against her",
  "\u00a3200, 000",
  "two"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "dumfries and galloway pensioner": The article states that Wanda Campbell was found guilty of stealing money from James Haugh Castle Douglas, but it does not mention anything about the victim being a pensioner from Dumfries and Galloway. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
2. "stealing more than £200, 000 from a dumfries and galloway pensioner": The article states that Campbell was ordered to pay compensation of £110,000, but it does not mention the amount of money she stole. Additionally, the article does not mention anything about the victim being a pensioner from Dumfries and Galloway. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
3. "\u00a3200, 000": The article does not use the symbol "£" to represent British pounds. Instead, it uses the word "pound" or "pounds" to refer to the currency. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.
4. "two": The article states that Campbell was jailed for three years, not two years. Therefore, this phrase is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains several inconsistencies with the article, including the victim's location, the amount of money stolen, and the length of Campbell's sentence.
