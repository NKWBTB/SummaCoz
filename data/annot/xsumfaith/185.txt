BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died.
A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset.
The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.
The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to Â£11.7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care "must be eliminated by 2020/21".
"We will work to a faster timetable if at all possible," said a spokeswoman.
"We will consider Dr Carlyon's letter in detail once it arrives." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that mental health patients in Cornwall will be sent to the county for treatment, as stated by a coroner.
2. However, the article does not support this statement. Instead, it reports that mental health patients in Cornwall are already being sent out of the county for treatment due to a lack of acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
3. The article mentions that an inquest heard that a man from St Austell died after being treated 140 miles away from his home, highlighting the issue of patients being sent out of the county for treatment.
4. The article also states that the Department of Health has acknowledged that "unacceptable" patients are receiving care far from home, and that they have accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce to eliminate the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care by 2020/21.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the current situation of mental health patients in Cornwall being sent out of the county for treatment, and it does not mention the issue of inadequate mental health resources in Cornwall.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the current situation of mental health patients in Cornwall being sent out of the county for treatment, and it does not mention the issue of inadequate mental health resources in Cornwall.
