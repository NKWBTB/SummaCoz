    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a 19-year-old indian student has been shot dead at a school in the southern indian city of bangalore. 

    Article: 
    The shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School in Bangalore city.
Police say the alleged gunman, identified as Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school.
Incidents of gun crime at schools and colleges in India are very rare. It is not clear what prompted the shooting.
Police said on Thursday that Mahesh had been remanded until 12 April.
Mahesh is alleged to have barged into the room of 18-year-old Gautami and shot her in the head with a pistol on on Tuesday evening.
He then shot another student, Sirisha, who suffered severe injuries but is believed to be out of danger, say police.
He was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt.
India has strict control laws, although a large number of feuds are settled with firearms.
In 2007, a 14-year-old schoolboy was shot dead by two fellow students at a school campus near the capital, Delhi. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the shooting occurred at a school in Bangalore, but the article states that the shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School in Bangalore. The word "school" is not mentioned in the article.
2. The summary mentions that the alleged gunman, Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school, but the article does not mention this detail.
3. The summary states that Gautami, an 18-year-old student, was shot in the head and killed, but the article does not mention her name or age. It only mentions that two students were shot, with one of them, Sirisha, suffering severe injuries.
4. The summary states that the shooting occurred on Tuesday evening, but the article does not mention the specific day of the week or time of the shooting.
5. The summary mentions that India has strict control laws, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
