    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Billy McKenzie has become the first professional boxer to win a professional career.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about McKenzie winning a professional career. Instead, it mentions that he will be taking on Jahmaine Smyle for the English super-middleweight championship on November 12th.
3. The article also mentions that McKenzie has a record of eight wins and one draw from his nine fights, which suggests that he has already had a professional career and has been successful in his fights.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that McKenzie has won a professional career, when in fact he has already had a successful professional career and is taking on another challenge.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
