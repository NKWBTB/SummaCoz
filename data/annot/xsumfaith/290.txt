    Summary: 
    former lib dem leader nick clegg has urged the lib dems to ``guarantee\'\'the government\'s future in the house of lords. 

    Article: 
    Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to "concede everything", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people "false hope".
The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.
But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons.
A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was "fairly obvious grandstanding" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.
"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government," the source said.
For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of "waving through the government's plans" and "lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit".
It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.
Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: "The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on."
But the Labour source predicted "residual tensions", adding: "I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering.
"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Nick Clegg urged the Liberal Democrats to "guarantee the government's future in the House of Lords." However, the article does not mention anything about Nick Clegg or the Liberal Democrats guaranteeing the government's future in the House of Lords.
2. Instead, the article focuses on the tensions between the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties in the House of Lords, particularly regarding their differing approaches to Brexit.
3. The article states that the two parties have teamed up to inflict defeats on the government, but that cooperation went out the window when MPs rejected their amendments.
4. The Labour source in the Lords is quoted as saying that the Lib Dems' efforts to insist on their amendments are "fairly obvious grandstanding" and that it's "pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope" with the public.
5. The article also mentions that the Lib Dems have accused Labour of "waving through the government's plans" and "lining up with the Conservatives on a hard Brexit."
6. Based on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Nick Clegg urging the Liberal Democrats to guarantee the government's future in the House of Lords. Instead, the article focuses on the tensions between the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties in the House of Lords regarding Brexit.

Therefore, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it misrepresents the content of the article by focusing on a non-existent statement by Nick Clegg, while the article actually focuses on the tensions between the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties in the House of Lords.
