<Article>
Lib Dem Lord Oates accused Labour of being prepared to "concede everything", and the opposition's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, responded that his party was giving people "false hope".
The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.
But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons.
A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was "fairly obvious grandstanding" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.
"It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government," the source said.
For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of "waving through the government's plans" and "lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit".
It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.
Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: "The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on."
But the Labour source predicted "residual tensions", adding: "I can't imagine there'll be much demand here to organise a 'progressive consensus summer drinks' gathering.
"Our respective leaderships will of course continue to keep things business-like."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Lib Dems and Labour have teamed up to inflict defeats on the government in the Lords, but the cooperation went out the window when MPs rejected the amendments.
2. The article quotes a Labour source in the Lords as saying that the Lib Dems' actions are "fairly obvious grandstanding" and that they are building up false hope with people worried about their future in Britain.
3. The article also quotes the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford as accusing Labour of "waving through the government's plans" and "lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit".
4. Based on these quotes, it is clear that there is a rift between the Lib Dems and Labour in the Lords, and that the Lib Dems are not in favor of the government's Brexit plans.
5. The summary, on the other hand, states that former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has urged the Lib Dems to "guarantee" the government's future in the House of Lords. This is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of Nick Clegg or any such guarantee.
6. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not supported by the text.

Overall, the summary is not accurate because it introduces a new concept (Nick Clegg's urging the Lib Dems to guarantee the government's future in the House of Lords) that is not present in the article.
