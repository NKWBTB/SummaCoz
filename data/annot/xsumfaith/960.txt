"A total of 22 members responded and the team stood down at 18:17 GMT," Mourne Mountain Rescue said. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man fell from cliffs in the Firth of Forth, but the article does not mention the Firth of Forth at all. The article only mentions the Mourne Mountains and the Annalong Valley. This is an inconsistency.
2. The summary states that the man was airlifted to hospital, but the article does not mention anything about the man being taken to a hospital. Instead, the article states that the man had a "serious leg injury" and was airlifted off Slieve Gullion.
3. The summary states that the rescue took place on Sunday, but the article does not mention the date.
4. The summary mentions the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team, Belfast Coastguard, Irish coastguard, PSNI, and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service being involved in the rescue, but the article only mentions the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team, Belfast Coastguard, and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains details that are not present in the article, such as the location of the rescue (Firth of Forth instead of Mourne Mountains), the destination of the man (hospital instead of Slieve Gullion), and the involvement of additional organizations (such as the Irish coastguard).
