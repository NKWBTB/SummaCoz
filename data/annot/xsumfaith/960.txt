Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the casualty was airlifted off Slieve Gullion, which is located in the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland.
2. The summary states that the casualty fell from cliffs in the Mourne Mountains in the Firth of Forth.
3. The Firth of Forth is a large estuary located in Scotland, not Northern Ireland.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it places the location of the incident in the wrong country.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it provides incorrect information about the location of the incident.
