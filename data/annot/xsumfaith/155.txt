Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol.
2. The summary only mentions new flights between Inverness and Amsterdam, without mentioning any specific flight times.
3. The article does not mention anything about new flights between Inverness and Amsterdam, only that KLM has added more flights from the Highlands airport and Schiphol.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions new flights between Inverness and Amsterdam, while the article mentions additional flights from the Highlands airport and Schiphol.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions KLM added a new flight between Inverness and Amsterdam this summer.
2. The article does not mention the new flight was added in this summer.
