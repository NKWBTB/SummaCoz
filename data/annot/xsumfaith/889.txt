Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "ruled out of the rest of the super league": The article does not mention anything about Lee Duffy being ruled out of the rest of the Super League season. In fact, the article states that he has joined Featherstone on a one-year contract and will lead the team in their final league game against Toulouse.
2. "shoulder injury": The article does not mention anything about Lee Duffy having a shoulder injury.
3. "lee": The article refers to the head coach as "Lee Duffy", but the summary misspells his name as "lee".
4. "ruled out of the rest of the super league season": As mentioned earlier, the article does not mention anything about Lee Duffy being ruled out of the rest of the Super League season.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
