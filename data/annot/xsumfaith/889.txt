"We believe he has done a remarkable job in extremely difficult circumstances at Swinton and he deserves a great deal of credit for his efforts there."
Duffy, who played for Leigh, Widnes and Salford during a 16-year playing career, has been replaced by his former assistant Stuart Littler at fellow Championship side Swinton. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Lee Duffy has been ruled out of the rest of the super league season with a shoulder injury.
2. However, the article states that Duffy has joined Featherstone on a one-year contract and will lead the team in their final league game against Toulouse on Saturday.
3. This indicates that Duffy has not been ruled out of the rest of the season, but rather, he will be continuing to coach Featherstone for the remainder of the season.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that Duffy has been ruled out of the season, while the article states that he will be continuing to coach.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the summary states that Duffy has been ruled out of the season, while the article states that he will be continuing to coach.
