<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a company which runs a paper recycling plant in salford where a major fire broke out has had its environmental permit revoked. 

    Article: 
    Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays.
The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.
The firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said.
Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.
Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."
The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.
"The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said.
An EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.
"Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste."
The cause of the fire remains undetermined. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the company's environmental permit has been revoked, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended the company from accepting waste and that the EA is considering enforcement action against the site operators.
2. The summary states that the company was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that the fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport, and the environment.
3. The summary does not mention that the fire service visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months, as stated in the article.
4. The summary does not mention that the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators, as stated in the article.
5. The summary does not mention that the cause of the fire remains undetermined, as stated in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article, such as the company's environmental permit being revoked, and omits information that is present in the article, such as the fire service's visits to the premises and the EA's decision to take enforcement action.
