<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was found dead at a house in dorset. 

    Article: 
    Police were called to the A35 at Bloxworth, near Wareham, at about 09:10 BST after they were discovered by a dog walker.
Tests are under way to "determine the contents" of the cigarettes and HM Revenue and Customs has been informed.
Dorset Police urged anyone who may have found other packets in "unusual circumstances" to contact them. No arrests have been made. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but the article does not mention any arrests being made. This is a clear inconsistency between the summary and the article.
2. The summary mentions a man being found dead at a house in Dorset, but the article does not mention any death or fatality.
3. The article only mentions that police were called to the A35 at Bloxworth, near Wareham, after they were discovered by a dog walker, and that tests are underway to determine the contents of the cigarettes.
4. There is no mention of murder or any other criminal activity in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, specifically the mention of a man being found dead and a murder investigation.
