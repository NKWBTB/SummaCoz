Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that police were called to the A35 at Bloxworth, near Wareham, after they were discovered by a dog walker. The summary does not mention anything about a man being found dead at a house in Dorset.
2. The article mentions that tests are under way to "determine the contents" of the cigarettes and that HM Revenue and Customs has been informed. The summary does not mention anything about the contents of the cigarettes or HM Revenue and Customs.
3. The article states that no arrests have been made. The summary mentions that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, which is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (a man being arrested on suspicion of murder) and omits information that is present in the article (the contents of the cigarettes and HM Revenue and Customs being informed).
