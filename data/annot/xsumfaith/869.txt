    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    rangers have confirmed the appointment of manager paul durrant to remain as manager at the end of the season. 

    Article: 
    He spent last season in charge of the Under-20 development squad, but will not return for the start of pre-season training.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel, leaving Durrant without a position at Ibrox.
He spent 14 years as a player at Rangers, before returning as a coach in 2005.
Durrant held several positions in the youth set-up, then stepped up to work with the first team during Walter Smith's second spell as manager in 2007.
He was first-team coach when Ally McCoist succeeded Smith in 2011, then returned to working with the youths again after McCoist resigned during season 2014-15. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Paul Durrant will remain as manager at the end of the season.
2. However, the article states that Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel, which suggests that Durrant will not have a position at Ibrox next season.
3. The article also mentions that Durrant has spent 14 years as a player at Rangers and has held several positions in the youth set-up, but it does not mention anything about him being appointed as the manager at the end of the season.
4. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Durrant being appointed as the manager at the end of the season.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the article does not support the idea that Durrant will remain as manager at the end of the season. Instead, the article suggests that he will not have a position at Ibrox next season due to Mark Warburton's plans to alter the coaching personnel.
