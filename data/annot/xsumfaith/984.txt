<Article>
Bristol Sport Ltd, which owns the football club, wants to replace two stands to increase capacity.
The plan is an alternative to proposals to build a new stadium at nearby Ashton Vale, which has been delayed by an application for a town green.
Majority shareholder Steve Lansdown confirmed the club would begin work at a shareholder meeting on Tuesday.
The work was approved by Bristol City Council in November.
Mr Lansdown told the club's official website: "We'll sign the section 106 agreement any day now, and then we have six weeks to wait for the judicial review period.
"We wanted to give some certainty to supporters, so if we get through to March with no judicial review, then we will be going ahead with the redevelopment plans, starting in May."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Bristol Sport Ltd, the owner of the football club, wants to replace two stands to increase capacity. There is no mention of a new stadium or the mayor of Bristol being involved in the plans.
2. The summary states that the mayor of Bristol will sign a # [UNK] m upgrade to a new stadium. This is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of a new stadium or the mayor being involved in the plans.
3. The word "bristol" is also not consistent with the article, as the article only mentions Bristol Sport Ltd and the football club, not the city of Bristol.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a new stadium and the mayor of Bristol, neither of which are mentioned in the article.
