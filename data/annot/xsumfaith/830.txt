Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Richard Ellis, Ciaran Monaghan, and Ewan Sutherland are leaving their positions at the local authority.
2. The summary states that the chief executive of the Republic of Ireland council has said he will not stand in the job of the local authority.
3. The article does not mention anything about the chief executive of the Republic of Ireland council or the chief executive standing down.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary is incorrect. There is no mention in the article of the chief executive of the Republic of Ireland council or the chief executive standing down. The article only mentions the departure of three senior staff members at the local authority.
