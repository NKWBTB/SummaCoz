    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that Richard Ellis is leaving the council at the end of his contract on Friday.

2. The article does not mention anything about Ellis not standing in the job of the local authority or resigning as the chief executive of the republic of Ireland council.

3. Therefore, the summary statement "the chief executive of the republic of Ireland council has said he will not stand in the job of the local authority" is not consistent with the article.

4. The summary statement is incorrect because it implies that Ellis is stepping down as chief executive, which is not mentioned in the article.
