</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Germany's Alexander Jung has won Olympic gold in the dressage at Rio 2016.
2. However, the article does not mention Alexander Jung at all.
3. The article mentions Jung won aboard Sam, who was a late replacement when Fischertakinou contracted an infection in July.
4. The article also mentions that France's Astier Nicolas took silver and American Phillip Dutton won bronze, and that GB's William Fox-Pitt finished 12th.
5. The summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of Alexander Jung in the article.
6. The summary is incorrect because it mentions a gold medal winner who does not exist in the article.
7. The article does mention a rider named Jung, but he is not German, he is aboard Sam, and he did not win gold.
8. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the information in the article.
