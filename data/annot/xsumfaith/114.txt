    Summary: 
    torquay united have signed barrow\'s myles keating and barrow\'s ruairi keating on loan until january. 

    Article: 
    Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.
The ex-Aldershot and Exeter player, who has also played in Italy, could feature against his old club on 18 February.
Striker Keating, 21, was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams.
He has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps, with his move subject to international clearance.
"Myles hasn't played a huge amount of games for a 27-year-old, but he is the stature, the voice, and is the leader-type I've been after." Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"Ruairi is young, a little bit raw, but incredibly hungry to show what he's about."
The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that Torquay United have signed Myles Keating and Ruairi Keating on loan until January, but the article does not mention anything about a loan deal. Instead, it states that Myles Keating has joined the club permanently.
2. The summary mentions that both players have joined Torquay United from Barrow, but the article states that Myles Keating has joined from Sligo Rovers, while Ruairi Keating has joined from Galway United.
3. The summary does not mention anything about the players' positions, but the article states that Myles Keating is a centre-back and Ruairi Keating is a striker.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies about the players' positions, their previous clubs, and the type of transfer.
