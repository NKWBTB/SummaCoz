For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident occurred in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South, but the summary mentions "rotherham". This is inconsistent because "rotherham" is not mentioned in the article.
2. The article states that the victim, Adrian Fatchett, died despite being treated at the scene by paramedics, but the summary only mentions that he died. This is inconsistent because it does not provide the same level of detail as the article.
3. The article states that the victim was stabbed, but the summary does not mention this. Instead, it says "a man who died after being stabbed at a house in rotherham has been named by police". This is inconsistent because it does not accurately reflect the information in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important details.
