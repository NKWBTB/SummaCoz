</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Adrian Fatchett died after being injured at a house in Highfield Avenue, Athersley South.
2. The summary states that the man died after being stabbed at a house in Rotherham.
3. The article does not mention anything about the man being stabbed, only that he was injured.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the man died as a result of being stabbed, while the article only mentions that he died after being injured.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it provides additional information that is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that the man died after being injured, but it does not specify the cause of death or the method of injury.
