    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    an elephant has been killed by an elephant at a zoo in paris. 

    Article: 
    The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that an elephant was killed by another elephant at a zoo in Paris. However, the article does not mention anything about an elephant being killed. Instead, it states that a girl was hit by a stone thrown by an elephant at a zoo in Rabat, Morocco.
2. The summary is not consistent with the article because the event described in the summary did not occur at the same zoo or location as the article. The article is about an incident at Rabat Zoo in Morocco, while the summary mentions a zoo in Paris.
3. The article does not mention anything about an elephant being killed, but rather that a girl was hit by a stone thrown by an elephant. The summary is incorrect in stating that an elephant was killed.
4. The article provides information about the incident, including the fact that the girl was taken to hospital and died, and that the zoo stated that the enclosure met international standards. The summary does not provide any of this information and is therefore not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it describes an event that did not occur at the same location or involve the same incident as the article. Additionally, the summary contains incorrect information about an elephant being killed, which is not mentioned in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that an elephant was killed by another elephant at a zoo in Paris. However, the article does not mention anything about an elephant being killed. Instead, it states that a girl was hit by a stone thrown by an elephant at a zoo.
2. The summary mentions a zoo in Paris. However, the article does not mention the location of Rabat Zoo being in Paris.
