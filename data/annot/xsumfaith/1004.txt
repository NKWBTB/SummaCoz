    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the accused, John McGurk, stole £500,000 from a company owned by a former professional footballer. However, the article states that he is accused of stealing £572,206 from Patrick Bradley Ltd. This is a discrepancy of £72,206, which is not consistent with the summary.
2. The summary also states that the accused is an accountant, but the article does not mention this. This is a significant difference, as the summary implies that the accused's profession is relevant to the charges against him, but the article does not provide any information about his profession.
3. The summary mentions that the accused won an All-Ireland football championship and All-Star award in 1993, but the article does not mention anything about football or sports. This is another inconsistency between the summary and the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and inconsistencies. The article provides different information about the accused and the charges against him, and it does not mention anything about football or sports, which are the only things mentioned in the summary.
