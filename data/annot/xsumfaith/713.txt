Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that John Duffy has joined Featherstone Rovers as head coach, but the summary states that Jon Sharp was the previous head coach.
2. The article does not mention anything about Jon Sharp leaving the club, whereas the summary states that he has departed.
3. The article mentions that John Duffy has been appointed as the new head coach, but the summary does not provide any information about his appointment.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the departure of Jon Sharp and the appointment of John Duffy as the head coach of Featherstone Rovers.
