Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that John Duffy has joined Featherstone Rovers as head coach, but the summary only mentions "Featherstone Rovers" without specifying John Duffy as the head coach. Consistency issue.
2. The article mentions that Jon Sharp has left Featherstone Rovers, but the summary does not mention anything about Jon Sharp's departure. Consistency issue.
3. The summary states that Featherstone Rovers have appointed John Duffy as head coach, but the article does not mention anything about Featherstone Rovers appointing John Duffy. Consistency issue.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the information in the article.
