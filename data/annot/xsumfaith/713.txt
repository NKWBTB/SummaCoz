    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Featherstone Rovers have appointed John Duffy as head coach, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that Duffy has joined the club as assistant coach.
2. The summary implies that Duffy has been appointed as the head coach following the departure of Jon Sharp, but the article does not mention Sharp's departure.
3. The article states that Duffy has joined Featherstone on a one-year contract, but the summary does not mention this detail.
4. The summary mentions that Duffy will lead Featherstone in their final league game against Toulouse on Saturday, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it states that Duffy will lead the team in the Super 8 Qualifiers.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. Specifically, it does not accurately reflect the details of Duffy's appointment, his role at the club, or the team's upcoming schedule.
