<Article>
Sophie Fearns said son Charlie, of Merseyside, needs to fly back to Seattle, America for experimental treatment unavailable in the UK.
She said he urgently needs more T-Cell Therapy at Seattle Children's Hospital after the last transplant failed.
His mother said she was "ecstatic" and "overwhelmed" by the "selfless amazing person" who paid for his treatment.
Charlie has been ill since the age of three, she said.
After a third relapse in April she said there was "no option" left for treatment for him in the UK.
Mrs Fearns said the family, of Litherland, were left "heartbroken" when the first T-Cell transplant did not work.
She said the news the treatment has been paid for was "completely overwhelming".
"We don't know who this donor is but from the bottom of our hearts it means an incredible amount - not just from the foundation but everybody that supports Charlie."
Charlie's father Rob Fearns said they were "extremely grateful" for the generosity of the anonymous donation.
"He or she specifically asked to pay for Charlie.
"We thought we were going to have to fight tooth and nail like last time to get the funds together."
His parents said they received the confirmation via an email from the hospital on Wednesday saying someone had offered to foot the bill for them.
Now Charlie has had financial clearance from the hospital, the treatment will start as soon as possible.
Mr Fearns said he is expecting to find out the date next week.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "150,000",
  "\u00c2 # 150,000",
  "of 11 with leukaemia",
  "11 with leukaemia",
  "a mystery donor has paid \u00c2 # 150,000 to fund a ``last chance cure\\'\\'for a boy of 11 with leukaemia"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "150,000": The article states that the donor paid for Charlie's treatment, but it doesn't mention the amount. The summary states that the donor paid £150,000, which is not supported by the article.
2. "\u00c2 # 150,000": The symbol "\u00c2" is not present in the article, and the number "150,000" is not mentioned.
3. "of 11 with leukaemia": The article does not mention the age of the boy or that he has leukaemia. The summary is inconsistent with the article in this regard.
4. "11 with leukaemia": As above, the article does not mention the age of the boy or that he has leukaemia.
5. "a mystery donor has paid \u00c2 # 150,000 to fund a ``last chance cure\\'\\'for a boy of 11 with leukaemia": The article does not mention a "last chance cure" or that the donor is a mystery person.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as the amount of money paid and the age and medical condition of the boy.
