Sadio Mane scored twice in the space of 138 seconds as second-placed Spurs disappointed at Anfield.
"If you start a game like we start then it is very difficult," said Pochettino.
"It is difficult to fight for the Premier League if you show that lack of desire to play for a win."
Chelsea can extend their lead at the top if they beat Burnley at Turf Moor on Sunday, and Pochettino added: "If Chelsea go 12 points clear, it is a big problem."
Spurs have won just twice on the road since 24 September, including defeats at Chelsea and Manchester United in addition to draws at fellow top-six rivals Arsenal and Manchester City.
In their past 17 meetings with the other top-six sides away from home, Pochettino's team have won just once.
"In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League," the Argentine told BT Sport.
"We are in a position that is up to us. But if you show like today that you cannot cope with the pressure then it is difficult to challenge and fight for the Premier League."
Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day
"I couldn't believe what I was watching, they had the best defensive record last season and the joint best this year, but they were all over the place. Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today, but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three.
"It was so unlike Spurs, they do so well at home, but the contrast is amazing. There's a lack of pace, and a different mindset when they go away from home. They have to improve and quickly."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "tottenham boss mauricio",
  "tottenham"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Spurs disappointed in their match against Liverpool, with Pochettino criticizing his team's lack of desire and pace.
2. The article quotes Pochettino as saying, "If Chelsea go 12 points clear, it is a big problem." This suggests that Pochettino does not believe his team is currently in a position to challenge for the Premier League title.
3. The article also notes that Spurs have struggled away from home against top-six teams, winning only once in their past 17 matches.
4. Based on these points, it is clear that the article does not support the idea that Tottenham can win the Premier League title, as stated in the summary.
5. The summary's statement that "tottenham boss mauricio pochettino says the team can win the premier league title" is not supported by the article, as Pochettino's actual quotes suggest the opposite.
6. Furthermore, the summary's statement that "tottenham" can win the title is also not supported by the article, as the article focuses on Pochettino's comments and the team's struggles, rather than making a general statement about the team's ability to win the title.

Therefore, the consistency issues in the summary are:

* "tottenham boss mauricio" - The article does not quote Pochettino as saying that the team can win the title.
* "tottenham" - The article does not make a general statement about the team's ability to win the title.

I hope this helps clarify the consistency issues in the summary!
