    Summary: 
    great britain\'s olympic taekwondo champion luke luke has been cut off at the austrian taekwondo federation (austrian). 

    Article: 
    Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme.
GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character".
Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform.
"If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the given summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary mentions that Luke Luke has been "cut off" by the Austrian Taekwondo Federation, implying that he has been excluded or rejected from the federation. However, the article does not mention anything about Luke being cut off or rejected.
2. The article states that Luke is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme, and that he will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June. This suggests that Luke is still a part of the program and will continue to train and compete.
3. The summary also mentions that Luke is a champion, but the article does not provide any information about him winning any championships or competitions.
4. The article is focused on the GB Taekwondo's Fighting Chance scheme and the 14 successful candidates, including Luke, who will undergo training and compete at the Austrian Open. The article does not mention anything about Luke being cut off or excluded from the federation.

Based on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, such as Luke being cut off by the Austrian Taekwondo Federation, and omits other important information that is present in the article, such as Luke's participation in the Fighting Chance scheme and his upcoming training and competition.
