<Article>
Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme.
GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character".
Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform.
"If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme. This means that Luke has been selected as one of the successful candidates, and he will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June.
2. The summary, on the other hand, states that Great Britain's Olympic taekwondo champion Luke has been cut off at the Austrian Taekwondo Federation (Austrian). This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Luke being cut off or eliminated from the competition.
3. The word "cut off" implies that Luke has been rejected or eliminated from the competition, which is not supported by the article. Instead, the article states that Luke has been selected as one of the successful candidates and will undergo training before competing at the Austrian Open.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be incorrect or misleading.
