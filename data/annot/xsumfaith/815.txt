For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "100m",
  "olympic 100m title with victory at the track cycling world championships in london",
  "world championships",
  "london"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "100m": The article does not mention the distance of the race, so this statement is not consistent with the article. The article only mentions that Storey won a gold medal in the track cycling event, without specifying the distance.
2. "olympic 100m title with victory at the track cycling world championships in london": This statement is not consistent with the article because the event was not an Olympic event, but a track cycling world championship. The article mentions that Storey won a gold medal in the track cycling event, but it does not specify that it was an Olympic event.
3. "world championships": The article does not mention any world championships, so this statement is not consistent with the article. The article only mentions that Storey won a gold medal in the track cycling event.
4. "london": The article does not mention the location of the event, so this statement is not consistent with the article. The article only mentions that Storey won a gold medal in the track cycling event.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations.
