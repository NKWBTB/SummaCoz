Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the event was held in Nottwil, Switzerland, but the summary states that the event was held in London. This is a clear inconsistency.
2. The article mentions that Storey won the 100m title, but the summary does not mention the distance.
3. The article states that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the summary does not mention anything about Rio or the Paralympics.
4. The article provides specific information about Storey's medals and titles, including her 22 medals and 11 golds, but the summary does not include any of this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the details of Storey's victory, including the location of the event, the distance she won, and her future goals.
