    1. The article states that Storey won the Olympic 100m title, but the summary states that she retained her Olympic title, which is incorrect since there is no Olympic 100m event.

2. The article states that the event took place in Nottwil, Switzerland, but the summary states that it took place in London, which is incorrect.

3. The article states that Storey won the event by more than two minutes, but the summary does not mention the margin of victory.

4. The article states that Storey will compete in the road race on Saturday, but the summary does not mention this.

5. The article provides information about Storey's past achievements and her target to win further Paralympic success, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
