</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that KLM has added new flights from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol.
2. The summary states that a new flight to the Highlands and Islands airports has been launched by the Scottish government.
3. The article does not mention anything about the Scottish government launching new flights. Instead, it states that KLM has added new flights.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it attributes the launch of new flights to the Scottish government, while the article states that KLM has added the flights.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly attributes the launch of new flights to the Scottish government, when in fact KLM has added the flights.
