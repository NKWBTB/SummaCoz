    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a new flight to the highlands and islands airports has been launched by the scottish government. 

    Article: 
    KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol.
Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) said the flights would allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home.
It is the latest addition from KLM since it started Inverness-Amsterdam flights last year. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol. This information is not mentioned in the summary.
2. The summary states that the Scottish government has launched a new flight to the highlands and islands airports, which is not accurate. The article states that KLM has added the flights, not the Scottish government.
3. The summary does not mention the destination of the flights, which is Amsterdam. The article states that the flights are from Inverness to Amsterdam.
4. The summary does not mention the purpose of the flights, which is to allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home. This information is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the same information as the article. The summary only mentions a new flight to the highlands and islands airports, but does not provide any details about the destination, purpose, or airline operating the flights.
