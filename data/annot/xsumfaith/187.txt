Mark Cooper has signed defenders Lee Collins and Callum Evans and midfielder Reece Brown as they prepare for their first season in the Football League. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Hartlepool United signed midfielder Gary McKeston on a one-year deal.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Gary McKeston joining Hartlepool United.
3. Instead, the article mentions the signings of defenders Lee Collins and Callum Evans and midfielder Reece Brown.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a signing that is not mentioned in the article.
5. The article only mentions the signings of three players (Lee Collins, Callum Evans, and Reece Brown), but the summary mentions a fourth player (Gary McKeston) who is not listed in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it mentions a signing that is not mentioned in the article.
