  "hartlepool united have signed midfielder gary mckeston on a one-year deal"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the player rejoined the club in July 2016, but the summary says "hartlepool united have signed midfielder gary mckeston on a one-year deal." This implies that the player was signed in the current season, which is not consistent with the article.
2. The article mentions that the player was ever-present in the team that won promotion to League Two last season, which suggests that he was already a part of the team when they were promoted. However, the summary implies that he is a new signing.
3. The article mentions that the player made 144 appearances in his first spell with the club before spending the 2015-16 season with Gateshead. This suggests that the player has previous experience with the club and has played for them before. However, the summary does not mention this.
4. The article mentions that the club has signed defenders Lee Collins and Callum Evans and midfielder Reece Brown as they prepare for their first season in the Football League. This suggests that the club is signing new players, but the summary only mentions one player, Gary McKeston.

Therefore, based on the inconsistencies mentioned above, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
