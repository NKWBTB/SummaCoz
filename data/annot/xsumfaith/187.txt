</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the player rejoined the club in July 2016, which means the signing took place in the middle of the 2016-2017 season.
2. The summary only mentions a one-year deal, which is not consistent with the article as the player rejoined the club in the middle of a season, not at the start of a new one.
3. The article mentions that the player made 144 appearances in his first spell with the club, which suggests that he has already played for the club before and is not a new signing.
4. The summary does not mention any of these details, which means it is not a consistent summary of the article.
