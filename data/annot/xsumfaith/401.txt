<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    rangers have appointed former rangers boss derek mcinnes as their new head coach. 

    Article: 
    He spent last season in charge of the Under-20 development squad, but will not return for the start of pre-season training.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel, leaving Durrant without a position at Ibrox.
He spent 14 years as a player at Rangers, before returning as a coach in 2005.
Durrant held several positions in the youth set-up, then stepped up to work with the first team during Walter Smith's second spell as manager in 2007.
He was first-team coach when Ally McCoist succeeded Smith in 2011, then returned to working with the youths again after McCoist resigned during season 2014-15. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that former Rangers boss Derek McInnes has been appointed as the new head coach, but the article does not mention anything about McInnes being appointed as the head coach.
2. The article states that Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel, which implies that McInnes will not be returning as the head coach.
3. The summary mentions that Durrant spent 14 years as a player at Rangers, but the article does not mention anything about Durrant being a player at Rangers.
4. The article states that Durrant held several positions in the youth set-up and worked with the first team during Walter Smith's second spell as manager, but the summary does not mention anything about Durrant's previous positions in the youth set-up or his work with the first team.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Derek McInnes as the new head coach, which is not mentioned in the article, and it also leaves out important details about Durrant's previous positions and experience.
