  "rangers have appointed former rangers boss derek mcinnes as their new head coach"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel at Rangers, which means that Durrant will not return for the start of pre-season training.
2. The summary claims that Rangers have appointed former Rangers boss Derek McInnes as their new head coach. However, there is no mention of Derek McInnes in the article.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not supported by the information in the article, and is considered inconsistent.

So, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary mentions Derek McInnes as the new head coach of Rangers, while the article does not mention him at all.
