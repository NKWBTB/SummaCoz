Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training.
A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs.
But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS.
It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors.
NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help.
The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting.
These included:
The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them.
It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened.
Are nurses the new doctors?
NHS short of front-line staff, MPs say
Report author Candace Imison said there were "huge opportunities" in reshaping the workforce, in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles.
And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said: "Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report."
But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce, this should not be done "at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves".
"It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients, and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience," he said.
"There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients."
And Unison head of health Christina McAnea said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was "all too often" no funding for training courses.
"Developing the NHS support workforce must not be seen as a quick and cheap fix for the chronic shortages of nurses and other health workers across the country," she added.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs. This suggests that nurses are already taking on roles that were previously performed by doctors and pharmacists.
2. The article also mentions that the Nuffield Trust highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting with nurses taking on more responsibilities. This suggests that the idea of nurses taking on more roles is not a new concept, but rather something that is already being explored in some areas.
3. The article quotes Dr. Mark Porter, the leader of the British Medical Association, as saying that while he supports increasing the skills of the workforce, this should not be done "at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves." This suggests that Dr. Porter is opposed to the idea of nurses taking on roles that were previously performed by doctors, as he believes that doctors require specialized training that cannot be replaced by nurses.
4. The article also quotes Christina McAnea, the head of health at Unison, as saying that the squeeze on funding in the health service means there is "all too often" no funding for training courses. This suggests that one of the challenges of implementing the Nuffield Trust's recommendations is the lack of funding for training and development.
5. Based on the information in the article, it appears that the Nuffield Trust's report is advocating for nurses to take on more responsibilities and for the workforce to be reshaped in order to address gaps in junior doctor rotas and the rising number of patients coming through GPs' doors. However, there is opposition to this idea from Dr. Porter and others, who argue that doctors require specialized training that cannot be replaced by nurses. Additionally, the lack of funding for training and development is a significant challenge to implementing the report's recommendations.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the key points of the Nuffield Trust's report and the challenges and opposition to its recommendations. The summary simply states that the NHS needs more fund

###Corrected:
1. The summary the NHS needs more funding to improve patient care. However, in the article, the report does not mention NHS needs for more funding. 
2. Instead, the article states the report advocating for nurses to take on more responsibilities and for the workforce to be reshaped in order to address gaps in junior doctor rotas and the rising number of patients coming through GPs' doors.
3. The article only mentions Christina McAnea, the head of health at Unison, saying that the squeeze on funding in the health service means there is "all too often" no funding for training courses.
