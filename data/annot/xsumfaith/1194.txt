    Summary: 
    an 18th century museum in london is to reopen as part of an art collection campaign to save it from being sold at auction. 

    Article: 
    About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.
But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.
Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.
The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.
Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday.
"Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.
The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.
In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.
Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.
The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.
Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news".
"The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said.

     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions an 18th century museum in London, but the article does not mention any museum in London. Instead, the article talks about the Wedgwood Museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.
2. The summary states that the collection is being reopened as part of an art collection campaign, but the article does not mention any campaign. Instead, it talks about a public fundraising campaign that was launched in September to save the collection from being sold at auction.
3. The summary mentions that the collection will be loaned to the Victoria and Albert Museum, but the article does not mention any plans to loan the collection to another museum. Instead, it states that the Art Fund will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum.
4. The summary does not mention the Pension Protection Fund or the high court ruling that the collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund, which are key details in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It appears to be a summary of a different article or a completely different topic.
