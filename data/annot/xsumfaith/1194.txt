About 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being auctioned to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt.
But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.
Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.
The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.
Administrator Bob Young said it had been "incredibly satisfying" to sign off on the sale on Monday.
"Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations," he said.
The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.
In 2010 the museum also went into administration, and in 2011 a high court judge ruled its collection could be sold to reimburse the Pension Protection Fund.
Alison Wedgwood, whose husband Tom is a direct descendant of company founder Josiah Wedgwood, said the collection was "important" for Staffordshire.
The collection risked being "sold and scattered around the globe" had the money not been raised, she added.
Tristram Hunt MP, who was involved in the campaign, said the sale was "fantastic news".
"The items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining our national identity today," he said.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that an 18th century museum in London is to reopen, but the article does not mention anything about the museum reopening.
2. The summary mentions a campaign to save the museum from being sold at auction, but the article does not mention any campaign or fundraising effort.
3. The article states that the collection was at risk of being sold to pay off the pottery firm's pension debt, but the summary does not mention anything about the pension debt or the risk of the collection being sold.
4. The article mentions that the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire, but the summary does not mention anything about the collection remaining on display or the location of the museum.
5. The article mentions that the collection will be gifted to the Victoria and Albert Museum and loaned to the Wedgwood Museum, but the summary does not mention anything about the collection being gifted or loaned to other museums.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the content of the article. The summary is too brief and lacks important details, and it contains information that is not present in the article.
