<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
The victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury at about 02:15 GMT on Friday when the assault occurred.
Investigating officers said three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people.
It is believed one of the group then set light to the woman's hair.
Officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack.
Det Sgt Barry Carr said: "Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse.
"This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible."

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "mcdonald\\'s",
  "mcdonald\\'s restaurant in kent, police said",
  "kent"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "mcdonald's" in the summary should be capitalized as it is a proper noun. The correct spelling is "McDonald's".
2. "mcdonald's restaurant in kent, police said" in the summary is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention "kent". The location of the assault is specified as "St George's Street, Canterbury", which is not the same as "kent".
3. "kent" in the summary is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention "kent" at all. The location of the assault is specified as "St George's Street, Canterbury", which is in Kent, but the word "Kent" is not used in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains errors in capitalization and location. The correct summary should be:

"A woman had her hair set alight in a 'nasty and extremely dangerous' attack at a McDonald's restaurant in Canterbury, police said."
