  "two-time olympic champion adam donaldson won gold"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the GB eight finished ahead of the Netherlands, but the summary claims that Adam Donaldson won gold in the women's quadruple sculls. This is inconsistent, as there is no mention of Adam Donaldson in the article.
2. The article states that the European champions were Romania and New Zealand, but the summary mentions only the European rowing championships. This is inconsistent, as it implies that the event was only a single championship, when in fact it was a championship won by multiple teams.
3. The article states that Holly Nixon and her team mates finished fifth in the women's quadruple sculls, but the summary makes no mention of this. This is inconsistent, as it implies that the team won gold, when in fact they finished fifth.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
