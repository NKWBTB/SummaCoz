    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    two-time olympic champion adam donaldson won gold in the women\'s quadruple sculls at the european rowing championships. 

    Article: 
    The 23 year-old stroked the GB boat to a fast start and they were ahead after 500m but European champions, Romania and New Zealand proved too strong.
The Romanians came out on top, with the British eight comfortably holding off the challenge from the Netherlands
The GB eight now prepare for the World Championships in Sarasota in September.
There was no medal success for Enniskillen's Holly Nixon in the women's quadruple sculls.
Nixon and her GB team mates Bethany Bryan, Alice Baatz and Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne, were always off the pace and finished fifth in a race won by Poland. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The article states that Romania won the gold medal in the women's quadruple sculls, not Adam Donaldson.
    2. The summary states that Adam Donaldson won the gold medal, which is not supported by the article.
    3. The article also mentions that the GB eight finished comfortably ahead of the Netherlands, but the summary does not mention this.
    4. The article states that Holly Nixon and her teammates finished fifth in the women's quadruple sculls, but the summary does not mention this either.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the text.
