    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the crash occurred on the M4 in Berkshire, but the article does not mention the M4 or Berkshire.
2. The summary states that a man was killed in the crash, but the article does not mention any fatalities.
3. The summary mentions South Wales Police, but the article only mentions Avon and Somerset Police.
4. The summary mentions the Lower Bristol Road in Bath being closed, but the article only mentions the A36 road being closed.
5. The summary states that the crash occurred at 03:00 GMT, but the article does not mention a specific time for the crash.
6. The summary mentions that investigations are underway, but the article only mentions that the road closure had caused disruption and delays to commuters and bus services during rush hour.
7. The summary mentions First Bus services being affected, but the article only mentions that Avon and Somerset Police closed the A36 road.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
