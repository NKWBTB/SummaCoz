</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "a man has been killed in a crash on the m4 in berkshire, south wales police has said"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is about a crash on the A36 road in Bath, Avon and Somerset Police have closed the Lower Bristol Road, and the investigation is ongoing.
2. The summary states that a man has been killed in a crash on the M4 in Berkshire, which is a different location and road altogether.
3. The article does not mention anything about the M4 or Berkshire, so this information in the summary is not supported by the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the spans highlighted in the consistency issues are the ones that do not match the information in the article.

Overall, the summary contains incorrect information about the location and details of the crash, which is not supported by the article.
