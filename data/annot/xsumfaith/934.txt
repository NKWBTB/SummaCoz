</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the incident occurred on the A36 road in Bath, while the summary claims that the incident occurred on the M4 in Berkshire. This is a clear inconsistency as the M4 is located in a different location and is not mentioned in the article.
2. The article states that the incident occurred at 03:00 GMT and the road was closed until 14:00 GMT, while the summary does not mention any specific time or road closure.
3. The article mentions that investigations are underway into how the collision happened, while the summary does not provide any information about the cause of the incident.
4. The article mentions that First Bus services were affected by the incident, while the summary does not mention anything about bus services.
5. The article quotes a managing director of First, James Freeman, while the summary does not provide any quotes or information about the people involved in the incident.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and was likely written based on incomplete or inaccurate information.
