<Article>
The call was made at a scrutiny meeting of the council to discuss the problems surrounding the new vessel.
Council leader Dave Stewart said the crossing at Cowes would be free until 2 July "in recognition of the problems" and to allow feedback.
Mr Stewart said the council had ordered a review of the project by auditors.
He said it had been a "frustrating and disappointing start" to the ferry.
Since launching late on 14 May the chain ferry has broken down, run aground and been suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to "training issues".
Cars have also been damaged getting on and off.
Shopkeeper Angie Booth, who owns Valu-4-U in East Cowes, said: "Whether I come out of this and survive I am not sure - other businesses too. We are bearing the brunt of the loss of almost six months of trade.
"Will you compensate local businesses, the same as for damaged cars?"
Transport councillor Ian Ward said compensation was up for discussion.
He added: "I don't think it's a disaster. It's a prototype. There are bound to be teething problems. There were electrical problems which the company has rectified."
He said the council authorised the manufacture of ramp extensions to resolve the problem of vehicles scraping the concrete.
He said groundings were an issue with seamanship, which had been resolved.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the council has ordered a review of the project by auditors due to the "frustrating and disappointing start" to the ferry. This suggests that the project has not gone smoothly and that there have been issues with the ferry's operation.
2. The article also mentions that the ferry has broken down, run aground, and been suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to "training issues". This further supports the idea that the project has been plagued by problems.
3. However, the summary states that the maritime attraction has been cancelled due to a lack of funds. This is not supported by the article, which does not mention any issues with funding.
4. Additionally, the article mentions that the council leader has announced that the crossing at Cowes will be free until 2 July to allow for feedback, which suggests that the council is actively working to address the issues with the ferry.
5. Therefore, based on the information in the article, it is not accurate to say that the maritime attraction has been cancelled due to a lack of funds. Instead, the article suggests that the project has been plagued by operational issues and that the council is working to address these issues.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and the inconsistency lies in the claim that the maritime attraction has been cancelled due to a lack of funds.
