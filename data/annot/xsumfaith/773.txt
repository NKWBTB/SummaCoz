<Article>
The decommissioned Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour.
Bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships.
The BBC understands no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted.
Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March.
A final decision is not expected until the spring.
The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.
Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said it was important UK recyclers had the chance to prove themselves in the field but she was also keen to see at least one of them saved from the scrapyard.
She added: "For anyone that has served on a ship it's your home, you've literally been through the wars with it... and you want them to have a noble second life.
"My preference is to go for the reef and diving attraction.
"We've got to get best value for the budget but a reef would also generate income for part of the country through tourism."
The Ministry of Defence has previously said it will "consider all options" for the frigates to ensure "best financial return for the taxpayer".
A spokeswoman would not comment on the number or nature of the bids received due to "commercial sensitivity".
Originally designed as a specialist anti-submarine ship, the Type 22 frigate evolved into a powerful surface combatant with substantial anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons systems.
They were also known for having excellent command and control, and communication facilities, making them ideal flagships on deployments, with a complement of about 280 crew.
Last year, the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was sold as scrap for Â£3m.

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:

  "bids for a new royal navy aircraft have been submitted to the public for the first time in the uk"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the decommissioned Type 22 frigates are being sold for scrap, and that the government's Disposal Services Authority wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.
2. The summary states that "bids for a new royal navy aircraft have been submitted to the public for the first time in the uk." This statement is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about new royal navy aircraft or bids being submitted to the public.
3. The article does mention that the Ministry of Defence will "consider all options" for the frigates to ensure "best financial return for the taxpayer," but this does not imply that new royal navy aircraft are being bid on.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not supported by the information in the article, and is considered to be inconsistent.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
