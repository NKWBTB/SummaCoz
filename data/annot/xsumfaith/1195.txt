Kemp, who last played Grant Mitchell in 2006, said it would be "a brief return".
"When I was approached about returning to EastEnders for Barbara's final episodes, it was something I could not turn down," he said.
Following her surprise return to Albert Square, Dame Barbara announced her character would be killed off.
Her character reappeared on Friday, having left in 2010, to tell her eldest son Phil, played by Steve McFadden, that her cancer had returned.
After the episode, producers revealed that Peggy would die from the disease in emotional scenes to be screened in the spring.
Now Kemp, who played Grant from 1990-1999 and then again in 2005 and 2006, will return to bring the Mitchell family back together.
"Barbara is a very close friend, so when I learned of the storyline it felt right that the Mitchell brothers are reunited with their mother for the last time," he said.
"I am really looking forward to going back to EastEnders and filming what are set to be some classic EastEnders episodes."
Grant Mitchell has been one of the soap's most memorable characters in its 30-year history, arriving in 1990 along with brother Phil.
He was involved in repeated family dramas including having an affair with his brother's wife, Kathy, and having his brother go on to marry his ex-wife Sharon.
"Grant Mitchell is an EastEnders legend and finally he is returning home to Walford to say goodbye to his mother and be reunited not just with his old loves but also his brother," said EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins.
"To have the Mitchell brothers come face to face again, having to face losing their mother, is an opportunity to show Ross Kemp and Steve McFadden at their very best."

<Summary>
eastenders actress barbara kemp has returned to eastenders to return to eastenders for a second time.
</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Barbara Kemp has returned to EastEnders for a second time.
2. However, the article states that Dame Barbara returned to EastEnders for her character's final episodes, and that her character will die from cancer in the spring.
3. Therefore, it is not possible for Barbara Kemp to have returned to EastEnders for a second time, as her character will have already passed away.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.

Therefore, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that Barbara Kemp has returned to EastEnders for a second time, when in fact her character has only returned for her final episodes and will die from cancer soon.
