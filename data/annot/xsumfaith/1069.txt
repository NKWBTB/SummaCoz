    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman was jailed for three years for conspiring to steal more than £110,000 from a Dumfries castle.
2. The article states that the woman was jailed for three years and ordered to pay compensation of £110,000 at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
3. However, the article also states that the woman's appeal against the sentence and conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh.
4. This means that the woman has not yet served her full sentence, as she is still awaiting the outcome of her appeal.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that the woman has already served her full sentence.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the summary states that the woman has already served her full sentence, while the article states that she is still awaiting the outcome of her appeal.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the woman was jailed for conspiring to steal more than £110,000. However, the article states that the woman was ordered to pay compensation of £110,000.
2. The summary states that the woman was conspiring to steal from a dumfries castle. However, the article states that the woman was acting with others to take the money from James Haugh Castle Douglas, not dumfries castle. In the article, Dumfries is a Sheriff Court.
3. The summary has grammatical errors.
