    Summary: 
    a sudden death at a pub in county londonderry alerted police to alcohol being served hours after closing time, a court has heard. 

    Article: 
    Paramedics were called to attend a sudden death at Joe's Bar in Dungiven at 06:00 BST on 6 October 2014, Limavady Magistrates Court was told.
Police arriving a short time later found several people still at the bar.
Till receipts showed alcohol was being served as late as 04:49 BST. The judge ordered its closure for three months.
Colleen O'Neill, 43, of Kevin Lynch Park in the town, was charged with two counts of allowing the consumption of liquor outside licensing hours.
James Thomas, 44, of the same address, faced one count of the same charge.
A defence solicitor told the court that the licensing laws in Dungiven "were not strictly adhered to".
He said it was clear that the premises had not been run in a proper manner and had been running well into the morning.
The judge said Ms O'Neill, who is the license holder, had "an appalling record" and expressed concern that he did not have power to impose a custodial sentence.
"This was as bad a case as I have come across and as bad a record," he said.
Ms O'Neill was also fined £3,000, while Mr Thomas was fined £1,000. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that alcohol was served hours after closing time, but the article states that till receipts showed alcohol was being served as late as 04:49 BST, which is not hours after closing time.
2. The summary states that the judge ordered the closure of the bar for three months, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that the license holder, Colleen O'Neill, had an "appalling record," but the article does not provide any information about her previous record or any other instances of non-compliance with licensing laws.
4. The summary states that the judge expressed concern that he did not have power to impose a custodial sentence, but the article does not mention any discussion of custodial sentences or the judge's sentencing options.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article and omits information that is included in the article.
