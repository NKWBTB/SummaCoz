  "france\\'s olympic gold medallist chris froome has won the rio 2016 olympic games for the rio olympics.\\n"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the athlete experienced racial abuse, but the summary does not mention anything about racial abuse. Consistency requires that all information in the summary should be supported by the article. Therefore, this is the first red flag.
2. The article states that the athlete considered representing France, but the summary does not mention anything about France. Again, consistency requires that all information in the summary should be supported by the article. Therefore, this is the second red flag.
3. The article does not mention anything about the athlete winning the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. In fact, the article states that the athlete is targeting a medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, which is different from winning the games. Therefore, this is the third red flag.
4. The summary mentions "france's olympic gold medallist chris froome" which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the athlete winning an Olympic gold medal, let alone representing France. Therefore, this is the fourth red flag.

Based on these four red flags, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, and therefore, it cannot be trusted as an accurate summary of the article.
