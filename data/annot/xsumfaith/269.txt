     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Chris Froome won the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, but the article does not mention anything about him winning an Olympic gold medal.
2. The article mentions that Chris Froome experienced racial abuse, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The article mentions that Chris Froome considered representing France, but the summary does not mention this either.
4. The article is about Chris Froome's journey to becoming a martial artist, but the summary does not mention anything about martial arts.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits important information that is present in the article. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content.
