<Article>
Clarkson, 30, joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
He scored nine goals at Dundee last season and has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term.
"I'm ready, I've been fit all season and I'm as fit as I've ever been," Clarkson told the St Mirren website.
"I've been playing games, playing for the U20s and I like to keep my match fitness up.
"I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit and hopefully up to speed with everyone else really. I'm looking forward to getting started."
Capped twice for Scotland in 2008 and with one international goal to his name, Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level.
His previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.
St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa.
"Obviously the game on Saturday, every game is a big game, and the more games we can win the more confidence we can get from that we can hopefully go on a run of games and push up the table and try to get the club back to where it has been," added Clarkson.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that St Mirren have signed Jack Clarkson on loan until the end of the season, with the option of a further 12 months.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a loan deal or an option for a further 12 months. Instead, it states that Clarkson has joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
3. The article also mentions that Clarkson has been playing mainly as a substitute this term and has been training hard to keep his match fitness up.
4. Based on the information in the article, it appears that Clarkson has joined St Mirren on a permanent transfer, rather than a loan deal.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it mentions a loan deal and an option for a further 12 months, which are not mentioned in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it implies that Clarkson has joined St Mirren on a loan deal, when in fact, the article suggests that he has joined the club on a permanent transfer.
