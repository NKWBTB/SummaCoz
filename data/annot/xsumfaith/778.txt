<Article>
Clarkson, 30, joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
He scored nine goals at Dundee last season and has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term.
"I'm ready, I've been fit all season and I'm as fit as I've ever been," Clarkson told the St Mirren website.
"I've been playing games, playing for the U20s and I like to keep my match fitness up.
"I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit and hopefully up to speed with everyone else really. I'm looking forward to getting started."
Capped twice for Scotland in 2008 and with one international goal to his name, Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level.
His previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.
St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa.
"Obviously the game on Saturday, every game is a big game, and the more games we can win the more confidence we can get from that we can hopefully go on a run of games and push up the table and try to get the club back to where it has been," added Clarkson.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Clarkson has joined Premiership club Well for a second spell, and could make his debut against Alloa on Saturday. This suggests that Clarkson has not signed for St Mirren, as the summary states.
2. The article mentions that Clarkson has been featuring mainly as a substitute this season, and has been training hard to keep his match fitness up. This suggests that he is not a permanent signing for St Mirren, as the summary states.
3. The article states that Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level, and has been capped twice for Scotland. This suggests that he is an experienced player, but does not indicate that he has signed for St Mirren on loan or permanently.
4. The article mentions that St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa. This suggests that the club is not in need of signing a midfielder, as the summary states.

Based on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that St Mirren have signed midfielder Jack Clarkson on loan until the end of the season, with the option of a further 12 months, but the article does not support this claim. Instead, the article suggests that Clarkson has joined Premiership club Well for a second spell and may make his debut against Alloa on Saturday.
