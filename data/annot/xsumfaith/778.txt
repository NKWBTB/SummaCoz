    Summary: 
    st mirren have signed st mirren midfielder jack clarkson on loan until the end of the season, with the option of a further 12 months. 

    Article: 
    Clarkson, 30, joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday.
He scored nine goals at Dundee last season and has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term.
"I'm ready, I've been fit all season and I'm as fit as I've ever been," Clarkson told the St Mirren website.
"I've been playing games, playing for the U20s and I like to keep my match fitness up.
"I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit and hopefully up to speed with everyone else really. I'm looking forward to getting started."
Capped twice for Scotland in 2008 and with one international goal to his name, Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level.
His previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.
St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa.
"Obviously the game on Saturday, every game is a big game, and the more games we can win the more confidence we can get from that we can hopefully go on a run of games and push up the table and try to get the club back to where it has been," added Clarkson.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that St Mirren have signed Jack Clarkson on loan until the end of the season, with the option of a further 12 months. However, the article does not mention anything about a loan deal or an option for a further 12 months. Instead, it states that Clarkson has joined Premiership Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut against Alloa on Saturday.
2. The summary also mentions that Clarkson has been fit all season and has been training hard, but the article does not provide any information about his fitness level or his training.
3. The summary quotes Clarkson as saying that he is ready to play and looking forward to getting started, but the article does not include any quotes from Clarkson.

Overall, the summary contains information that is not supported by the article, such as the loan deal and Clarkson's fitness level. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
