Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the interactive video "may not work on some older browsers." However, the summary does not mention anything about the video not working on certain browsers. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not supported by the article.
2. The article mentions the Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising in London, but the summary does not mention this detail. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a faithful summary of the article.
3. The article mentions the arrival of the domestic freezer, washing powder, and cheaper imports as reasons why we change what we buy, but the summary does not mention these specific reasons. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not supported by the article.
4. The article mentions extra information that can be found in a non-interactive format, such as "What in the world does China own?" and "Annual survey ranking the top 20 consumer brands in the UK," but the summary does not mention these details. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a comprehensive summary of the article.
5. The article states that the video works best in full screen, but the summary does not mention this detail. This inconsistency suggests that the summary is not a faithful summary of the article.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
