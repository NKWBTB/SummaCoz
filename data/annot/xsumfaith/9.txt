Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the interactive video may not work on some older browsers, and provides a non-interactive version of the content below.
2. The summary states that the BBC has released a series of information about the UK's food market and how it has changed since the start of the decade.
3. The article does not mention the BBC or any information about the UK's food market. Instead, it focuses on the interactive video and the reasons why we change what we buy, as outlined by Robert Opie, the founder of the Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising in London.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it refers to the BBC and the UK's food market, while the article does not mention these topics.

Overall, the summary is not accurate because it refers to information that is not present in the article.
