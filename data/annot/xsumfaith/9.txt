     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions the BBC releasing information about the UK's food market, but the article does not mention the BBC at all.
2. The summary talks about the video exploring how ownership and ranking of some of the biggest brands in the UK is changing, but the article does not mention anything about brands or ownership.
3. The summary mentions the video being interactive, but the article only provides a non-interactive version of the content.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it describes content that is not present in the article. The article is actually about a video featuring Robert Opie discussing reasons why consumer preferences change, and the interactive elements of the video explore these topics further.
