<Article>
The NSPCC's Childline service said it counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12.
The total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher.
Some children as young as seven told Childline how they were tormented, abused and scared to go to school.
The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children.
Childline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call.
"Bullying can wreck young people's lives, especially now that the bullies don't stop at the school gates," she said.
"Cyber-bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape.
"It is imperative that adults, parents and teachers, intervene to protect them, because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own, left alone it gets worse.
"Schools must take this problem seriously, and above all children must ask for help."
The report is being released at the start of Anti-Bullying Week which is coordinated by the Anti Bullying Alliance.
The group is working with parents, schools and other organisations to help combat the problem.
One young person who contacted Childline said: "It might sound like not much of a problem but there's a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself. I won't kill myself but it upsets me.
"My parents don't realise how upset it's making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don't know how hard that is.
"I don't know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the number of children who have been abused online has more than trebled in the past year, according to the NSPCC's Childline service.
2. However, the summary only states that the number of children who have been abused online has increased, without providing any specific figures or information about the extent of the increase.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not provide the same level of detail or specific information about the increase in online abuse.
4. The article provides specific figures and examples of the types of abuse that children are experiencing online, such as being tormented, abused, and scared to go to school. The summary does not include any of this information.
5. The article also includes quotes from the president of Childline, Dame Esther Rantzen, who emphasizes the importance of adults, parents, and teachers intervening to protect children from online bullying. The summary does not include any of these quotes or this information.

Overall, the summary does not provide the same level of detail or specific information about online abuse as the article, and therefore is not consistent with the article.
