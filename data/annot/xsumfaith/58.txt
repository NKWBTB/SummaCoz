<Article>
The NSPCC's Childline service said it counselled more than 4,500 children in the past year compared to about 2,400 in 2011-12.
The total number suffering online abuse is thought to be far higher.
Some children as young as seven told Childline how they were tormented, abused and scared to go to school.
The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children.
Childline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call.
"Bullying can wreck young people's lives, especially now that the bullies don't stop at the school gates," she said.
"Cyber-bullying can follow them home until it becomes a persecution they cannot escape.
"It is imperative that adults, parents and teachers, intervene to protect them, because we have learned over the years from Childline callers that bullying does not stop on its own, left alone it gets worse.
"Schools must take this problem seriously, and above all children must ask for help."
The report is being released at the start of Anti-Bullying Week which is coordinated by the Anti Bullying Alliance.
The group is working with parents, schools and other organisations to help combat the problem.
One young person who contacted Childline said: "It might sound like not much of a problem but there's a group of people I play with online and they told me to kill myself. I won't kill myself but it upsets me.
"My parents don't realise how upset it's making me and they tell me to stand up for myself or just not play anymore but they don't know how hard that is.
"I don't know why they have suddenly started picking on me but it hurts so much."

<Summary>
the number of uk children who have been abused online has more than trebled in the past year, a charity has said.
</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "uk",
  "trebled"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "uk" - The article does not mention anything about the UK specifically. The NSPCC's Childline service counselled children in the past year, but there is no information about the location of these children. Therefore, the word "uk" should not be included in the summary.
2. "trebled" - The article does not use the word "trebled" to describe the increase in online abuse. Instead, it states that the number of children counselled by Childline has increased by more than 1,000 compared to the previous year. The correct word to use would be "increased" or "risen", not "trebled".

Therefore, the summary should read:

<Summary>
The number of children counselled by Childline for online abuse has increased by more than 1,000 in the past year, according to the NSPCC.
</Summary>

This summary is more accurate and consistent with the information provided in the article.
