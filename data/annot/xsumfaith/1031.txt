    Article:

A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time.
But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Greenock Morton extended their lead at the top of the Scottish League Two table with victory over Greenock Morton. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Greenock Morton in the article.
2. The article mentions that McManus netted from close range to open the scoring, but the summary does not mention this.
3. The summary states that Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead, but the article does not mention Forbes or a deflected strike.
4. The article mentions that Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game with a shot before half-time, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The summary states that another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts, but the article does not mention these finishes or Johnstone.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
