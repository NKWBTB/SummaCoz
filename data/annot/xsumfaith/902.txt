]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the teams are playing in the "national league" and the play-off round.
2. The summary claims that Nottingham Forest secured promotion to the "national league" with a win over Nottingham Forest Green Rovers.
3. However, there is no mention of Nottingham Forest Green Rovers in the article. The article only mentions Nottingham and Sheffield Steelers as the teams playing in the national league.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a team (Nottingham Forest Green Rovers) that does not exist in the article.

So, the inconsistency is in the fact that the summary mentions a team that is not present in the article, and therefore the summary is not accurate.
