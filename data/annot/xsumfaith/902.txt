    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Nottingham Forest secured promotion to the national league with a win over Nottingham Forest Green Rovers. However, the article does not mention anything about Nottingham Forest securing promotion or playing against Nottingham Forest Green Rovers.
2. The article mentions a game between the Giants and the Panthers, with the Giants winning 4-2. The summary does not mention any game between these teams.
3. The article mentions the Giants' player-coach Derrick Walser scoring a short-handed opener, but the summary does not mention any specific players or their contributions to the game.
4. The article mentions the Panthers equalizing the score, but the summary does not mention any equalizing goal.
5. The article mentions the Giants scoring three more goals in the second period, but the summary does not mention any additional goals scored by the Giants.
6. The article mentions the final score being 4-2 in favor of the Giants, but the summary does not mention the final score.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events described in the article. The summary mentions a game between Nottingham Forest and Nottingham Forest Green Rovers, which does not exist in the article. Additionally, the summary does not accurately describe the events of the game between the Giants and the Panthers, such as the players who scored and the final score.
