3. The article mentions that Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers are teams in the National League, but it does not mention Nottingham Forest Green Rovers.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a team (Nottingham Forest Green Rovers) that does not exist in the article.
5. Additionally, the summary claims that Nottingham Forest secured promotion to the National League, but the article does not mention anything about promotion or relegation.
