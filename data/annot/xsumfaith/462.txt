<Article>
Rockstar have announced the game's release has been delayed until 24 March.
The latest version of the open world adventure was due to go on sale on 27 January.
A statement from Rockstar said: "The game requires a few extra weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as can be."
"Moving a release date is never a decision we take lightly and is a choice we make only when we know it is in the best interests of the game and our fans.
"Thanks everyone for your understanding and we assure you these few extra weeks will be worth it when the game does arrive in March."
It's not all bad news though. The company announced that eagerly-awaited online heists are coming to consoles before the PC release date.
Screenshots from the PC version of GTA V have been released, with Rockstar promising "even greater levels of detail".
Los Santos and Blaine County will be visible in 1080p at 60fps, with up to 4K resolution and support for up to triple monitor configurations.
While you're waiting for the game to be released you can make sure your PC is up to scratch.
Minimum specifications required to run GTA V have also been published.
Grand Theft Auto V became the fastest-selling entertainment product ever when it was released on 17 September 2013, taking just three days to generate $1bn (Â£620m) in revenue.

<Summary>
the first game of the game of grand theft auto has been released by the national tennis league (gta).
</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "national tennis league",
  "first"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "National tennis league" is not a correct statement. The correct name of the video game franchise is "Grand Theft Auto" (GTA), not "national tennis league".
2. "First" is also not a correct statement, as there have been several games in the GTA series before the one being discussed in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two incorrect statements. The correct summary should be more accurate and reflect the content of the article, such as:

"Rockstar has delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto V until 24 March, citing the need for additional testing and polish. The game will feature online heists and improved graphics, and the minimum specifications for PC have been published. The article also mentions that the game became the fastest-selling entertainment product ever when it was released in 2013."
