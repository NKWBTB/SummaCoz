The latest version of the open world adventure was due to go on sale on 27 January.
A statement from Rockstar said: "The game requires a few extra weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as can be."
"Moving a release date is never a decision we take lightly and is a choice we make only when we know it is in the best interests of the game and our fans.
"Thanks everyone for your understanding and we assure you these few extra weeks will be worth it when the game does arrive in March."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Rockstar has announced the delay of the game's release until March 24th, while the summary claims that the first game of Grand Theft Auto has been released. This is inconsistent, as there has been no previous release of Grand Theft Auto.
2. The article mentions that the game is an open-world adventure, while the summary refers to a tennis league. This is inconsistent, as there is no mention of tennis in the article.
3. The article mentions that the game is developed by Rockstar, while the summary does not mention the developer. This is inconsistent, as it is important to attribute the game's development to Rockstar.
4. The article provides specific details about the game's release date, online heists, and system requirements, while the summary does not provide any specific information about the game. This is inconsistent, as the summary should provide at least some basic information about the game.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides incorrect information about the game's release and genre, and lacks specific details about the game.
