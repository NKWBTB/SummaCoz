    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the first game of the game of grand theft auto has been released by the national tennis league (gta). 

    Article: 
    Rockstar have announced the game's release has been delayed until 24 March.
The latest version of the open world adventure was due to go on sale on 27 January.
A statement from Rockstar said: "The game requires a few extra weeks of testing and polish to make it as good as can be."
"Moving a release date is never a decision we take lightly and is a choice we make only when we know it is in the best interests of the game and our fans.
"Thanks everyone for your understanding and we assure you these few extra weeks will be worth it when the game does arrive in March."
It's not all bad news though. The company announced that eagerly-awaited online heists are coming to consoles before the PC release date.
Screenshots from the PC version of GTA V have been released, with Rockstar promising "even greater levels of detail".
Los Santos and Blaine County will be visible in 1080p at 60fps, with up to 4K resolution and support for up to triple monitor configurations.
While you're waiting for the game to be released you can make sure your PC is up to scratch.
Minimum specifications required to run GTA V have also been published.
Grand Theft Auto V became the fastest-selling entertainment product ever when it was released on 17 September 2013, taking just three days to generate $1bn (Â£620m) in revenue.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Release date: The summary states that the first game of the game of grand theft auto has been released, while the article states that the release date has been delayed until 24 March.
2. Game details: The summary does not mention any details about the game, while the article provides information about the game's features, such as online heists, resolution, and frame rate.
3. Content: The summary does not mention anything about the article's content, such as the delay reason, the release date, and the game's features.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the game's release date and features. The summary is more of a generic statement about the game, while the article provides specific information about the game's delay and upcoming release.
