    Summary: 
    an agreement has been reached between the government and the scottish government after a dispute between the government and the rmt union. 

    Article: 
    Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said a  new charter arrangement would end the long-running row over seafarers' pay.
The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than Â£4 an hour.
The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month.
The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink.
Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents.
Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept.
Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised.
He said: "I'm very pleased to see an agreement in principle now in place to end this long running issue around the freight vessels serving the Northern Isles.
"The new charter basis will allow the wage issue to be resolved. Going forward, I can confirm that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage."
Serco Northlink was awarded the six-year Â£243m Northern Isles contract in 2012.
It operates three ferries and two cargo boats to the Northern Isles on a route which is heavily subsidised by the Scottish government. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that an agreement has been reached between the government and the Scottish government, but the article does not mention any agreement between the two governments. Instead, it focuses on a dispute between the RMT union and Seatruck, a contractor for Serco Northlink.
2. The summary mentions a dispute between the government and the RMT union, but the article does not mention any involvement of the government in the dispute. Instead, it focuses on the dispute between the RMT union and Seatruck.
3. The summary states that the new charter arrangement will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month, but the article does not mention any new charter arrangement or the return of contracted out services to Serco Northlink. Instead, it mentions that Seatruck has been operating the freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay under a charter agreement with Serco Northlink.
4. The summary mentions that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage under the new arrangements, but the article does not mention any requirement for Seatruck to pay its crew members the minimum wage. Instead, it mentions that Seatruck had argued that the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is missing key details and contains inaccuracies, such as the absence of any agreement between the government and the Scottish government, the lack of involvement of the government in the dispute, and the misstatement of the terms of the new charter arrangement.
