Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that the interactive video explores how ownership and ranking of some of the biggest brands in the UK is changing, but the summary does not mention anything about this.
2. The article mentions specific technological advancements, such as the arrival of the domestic freezer and cheaper imports, that have affected consumer tastes, but the summary does not mention any specific technological advancements.
3. The summary mentions "advancing technology and manufacturing techniques" as one of the ingredients of changing consumer tastes, but this is not supported by the article.
4. The article does mention that the video explores how ownership and ranking of some of the biggest brands in the UK is changing, but this is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary mentions advancing technology and manufacturing techniques as ingredients of changing consumer tastes, but the article does not support this claim. Additionally, the summary does not mention specific technological advancements that have affected consumer tastes, while the article does.
