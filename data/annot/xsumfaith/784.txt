    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Chris Bignot was under contract with Mansfield Town, but the club has reached an agreement to bring him in on a free transfer. This means that the summary's statement that Leyton Orient signed him on an initial short-term deal until the end of the season is not accurate.
2. The article also states that Chris Bignot spent the first half of the season on loan at Crawley, scoring three goals in 23 appearances. This information is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The article mentions that Bignot will officially join Leyton Orient on January 1, which is not mentioned in the summary.
4. The summary does not mention that Chris Bignot was previously on loan at Crawley or that he will officially join Leyton Orient on January 1.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all the information mentioned in the article, and some of the information it does include is not accurate.
