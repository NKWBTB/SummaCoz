</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Chris Bignot has joined Grimsby Town on a free transfer, while the summary claims that he has signed for Leyton Orient.
2. The article mentions that Bignot was previously on loan at Crawley Town, scoring three goals in 23 appearances. The summary does not mention this detail.
3. The article states that Bignot will officially join Grimsby Town on January 1st, while the summary claims that he has already signed an initial short-term deal until the end of the season.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the club that Bignot has signed for (Leyton Orient instead of Grimsby Town), and it omits important details about his previous loan spell at Crawley Town.
