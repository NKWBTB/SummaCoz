Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Marcus Bignot's side (Mansfield Town) have reached an agreement to bring Chris Bignot in on a free transfer.
2. The summary states that Chris Bignot has signed for League Two club Leyton Orient on an initial short-term deal until the end of the season.
3. The problem is that Leyton Orient is not mentioned in the article at all. The article only mentions Mansfield Town and Crawley, where Chris Bignot was on loan.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Chris Bignot has signed for Leyton Orient is not supported by the article.

So, the consistency issue is that the summary mentions a different club (Leyton Orient) than the one mentioned in the article (Mansfield Town).
