<Article>
An area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated for most of the morning and early afternoon.
Other residents close by had been advised to open windows, stay indoors near walls and to avoid going outside.
An exclusion zone remains in force on the river while experts make safe the sea mine which was spotted on Monday.
It is thought to be a British mine, dating from the  1940s or 1950s.
The evacuation affected three streets, with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500m of the device.
There was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile, and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation.
Caledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services, affecting sailings from Gourock and Rothesay.
Ch Insp Elliot Brown, the local area commander for Inverclyde, stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure, and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gourock.
Lt Cdr Tim Castrinoyannakis, the officer in charge of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Unit, said that due to the deterioration of the mine it was not possible to conclude how much explosive material it still contained.
He said that because of this it was decided to move it to a safer place before dealing with it.
Inverclyde Council said: "Thanks to residents and businesses in Gourock for their patience while the cordon and safe evacuation procedures were carried out today."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that an unexploded World War II mine was evacuated off the south coast of Scotland.
2. The article does not mention any evacuation of a mine. Instead, it reports on an evacuation of a area near a swimming pool due to the presence of a sea mine, which is thought to be a British mine from the 1940s or 1950s.
3. The summary implies that the mine was evacuated, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions an evacuation of a nearby area as a precautionary measure.
4. The summary refers to the mine as being from World War II, but the article does not provide any information about the age of the mine.
5. The summary does not mention any disruption to ferry services or the presence of an exclusion zone at sea, which are both mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains inaccuracies and omits important information from the article.
