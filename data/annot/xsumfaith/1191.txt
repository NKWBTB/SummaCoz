    Summary: 
    an unexploded world war two mine has been evacuated off the south coast of scotland after an explosive device was found. 

    Article: 
    An area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated for most of the morning and early afternoon.
Other residents close by had been advised to open windows, stay indoors near walls and to avoid going outside.
An exclusion zone remains in force on the river while experts make safe the sea mine which was spotted on Monday.
It is thought to be a British mine, dating from the  1940s or 1950s.
The evacuation affected three streets, with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500m of the device.
There was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile, and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation.
Caledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services, affecting sailings from Gourock and Rothesay.
Ch Insp Elliot Brown, the local area commander for Inverclyde, stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure, and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gourock.
Lt Cdr Tim Castrinoyannakis, the officer in charge of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Unit, said that due to the deterioration of the mine it was not possible to conclude how much explosive material it still contained.
He said that because of this it was decided to move it to a safer place before dealing with it.
Inverclyde Council said: "Thanks to residents and businesses in Gourock for their patience while the cordon and safe evacuation procedures were carried out today."

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that an unexploded World War II mine was evacuated off the south coast of Scotland, while the article only mentions an evacuation in Gourock, which is a town on the south coast of Scotland.
2. The summary mentions that the mine was found, but the article does not mention how the mine was discovered.
3. The summary states that the evacuation was due to an explosive device being found, while the article states that the evacuation was a precautionary measure due to the discovery of a sea mine.
4. The summary does not mention any details about the mine being British, dating back to the 1940s or 1950s, or the exclusion zone at sea or disruption to ferry services, which are all mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
