<Article>
The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
2. The article also states that police are not sure if the woman was in the house at the time of the fire.
3. The summary states that police are trying to trace a woman who is unaccounted for after a fire at her home in the highlands.

The inconsistency here is that the article does not mention anything about the woman being unaccounted for. In fact, the article states that police are not sure if she was in the house at the time of the fire, which suggests that they do not have any information about her whereabouts.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the woman is missing or unaccounted for, which is not supported by the information in the article.
