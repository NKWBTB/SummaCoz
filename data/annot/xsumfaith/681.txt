<Article>
The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00, indicating that the fire occurred at night.
2. The article states that the fire was not thought to be suspicious, suggesting that it was not intentionally set.
3. The article states that the damage caused by the fire has prevented entry to the property, indicating that the woman may still be inside the property.
4. The article states that police are conducting an investigation and have informed the woman's relatives, suggesting that they are actively searching for the woman.

Based on these points, the summary provided is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the fire or the fact that the woman is unaccounted for. Instead, the summary only states that police are trying to trace a woman, which is not specific enough to be consistent with the article. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not provide a clear and concise summary of the article.
