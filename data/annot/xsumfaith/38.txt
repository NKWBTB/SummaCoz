Find out why.

<Article>
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found the number had gone up by 200 million since 2013.
There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in the last few years, many of them can't be recycled and are often thrown away after they have been used.
The bags end up in rubbish dumps and even rivers causing big problems for the environment.
From October people in England will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in a bid to encourage them to reuse the ones that they already have.
Supermarkets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where people are charged for carrier bags, have all seen a decrease in bags used.
Campaigners are hoping the charge in England will lessen the amount of bags being thrown away, helping the environment.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the number of plastic carrier bags used in England has gone up by 200 million since 2013. This indicates that the number is not at a record high, but rather has increased over time.
2. The summary claims that the number of people using plastic carrier bags in England has reached a record high. This is not supported by the article, as the article states that the number has increased, not reached a record high.
3. The phrase "record high" implies that the number is at its highest point ever, which is not true according to the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it makes a claim that is not supported by the information provided in the article.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
