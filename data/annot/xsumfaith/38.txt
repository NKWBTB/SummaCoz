    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the number of people using plastic carrier bags in england has reached a record high. 

    Article: 
    The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found the number had gone up by 200 million since 2013.
There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in the last few years, many of them can't be recycled and are often thrown away after they have been used.
The bags end up in rubbish dumps and even rivers causing big problems for the environment.
From October people in England will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in a bid to encourage them to reuse the ones that they already have.
Supermarkets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where people are charged for carrier bags, have all seen a decrease in bags used.
Campaigners are hoping the charge in England will lessen the amount of bags being thrown away, helping the environment. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the number of people using plastic carrier bags in England has reached a record high.
2. However, the article states that the number of plastic carrier bags used in England has gone up by 200 million since 2013, which implies that the number is not at a record high.
3. The article also states that there has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in recent years, and that many of them cannot be recycled and end up in rubbish dumps and rivers, causing environmental problems.
4. To address this issue, the government is introducing a charge of 5p for plastic bags in England, starting from October.
5. The article mentions that supermarkets in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, where a charge for carrier bags is already in place, have seen a decrease in the number of bags used.
6. Therefore, the summary statement that the number of people using plastic carrier bags in England has reached a record high is not consistent with the information in the article, as the article actually states that the number has increased by 200 million since 2013 but the charge will help to reduce the number of bags used.
