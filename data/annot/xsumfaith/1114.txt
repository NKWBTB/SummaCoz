    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a container ship has washed up on a cornish beach, leaving two dead and three others injured. 

    Article: 
    They started arriving at Poldhu Cove on the Lizard on Sunday, and National Trust volunteers have been clearing them away as they are said to pose a risk to wildlife.
The bottles are sealed, but witnesses say some have leaked.
The National Trust said it believed a container had gone overboard from a ship, during the stormy weather.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: "While it is fact that the MV Blue Ocean lost a container containing bottles of 'Vanish', there is no currently available evidence that the bottles washed up on the Cornish coast are from this container; all evidence is currently circumstantial."
It is thought the vessel lost the container near Land's End in May.
The BBC has contacted Vanish, but the company is yet to comment.
Other nearby coves including Gunwalloe, Polurrian, Church Cove and Marazion have also been affected, conservationists said.
Cornwall Wildlife Trust said it was "highly concerned" about the impact on "sensitive marine life".
Justin Whitehouse, from the National Trust, said: "The main worry is all that detergent going into our beautiful marine environment, but thankfully most are full.
"We think it's a container that has gone overboard from a container ship, during stormy seas."
Cornwall Council said the authority and partners, including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Natural England, would be monitoring beaches in the area.
It said: "The National Trust who own the beach at Poldhu have arranged for the bottles to be cleared away.
"In the meantime the public are advised to keep children and dogs at a safe distance from the bottles should any more be washed up.
"No attempt should be made to recover the bottles." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that two people died and three others were injured when a container ship washed up on a Cornish beach.

2. However, the article does not mention any deaths or injuries. Instead, it reports that a container is believed to have gone overboard from a ship during stormy weather, and that bottles of detergent have washed up on nearby beaches.

3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information about deaths and injuries that is not present in the article.

4. The article does mention that the National Trust is clearing away the bottles because they pose a risk to wildlife, but it does not mention any casualties.

5. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has stated that there is currently no evidence that the bottles washed up on the Cornish coast are from the container that went overboard, and that all evidence is circumstantial.

6. The article also reports that the container is believed to have gone overboard near Land's End in May, but the bottles have only recently started washing up on beaches.

7. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information about the container ship washing up on the beach and causing casualties, which is not supported by the article.
