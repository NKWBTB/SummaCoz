</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the incident occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness, but the summary states that the incident occurred in Aberdeenshire. This is inconsistent, as Aberdeenshire is not located near Berriedale or Caithness.
2. The article states that several other people received minor injuries in the crash, but the summary does not mention any injuries. This is inconsistent, as the article suggests that there were other people involved in the incident who were injured.
3. The article states that the road was closed and diversions were put in place, but the summary does not mention any road closures or diversions. This is inconsistent, as the article suggests that the incident had a significant impact on traffic.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the details of the incident. The summary only mentions the location of the incident (Aberdeenshire), but leaves out important details such as the number of people injured and the road closures.
