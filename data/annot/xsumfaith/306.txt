Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness, but the summary says the incident happened in Aberdeenshire. This is a consistency issue because Aberdeenshire is not mentioned in the article at all.
2. The article does mention that the road was closed and diversions were put in place, but the summary does not include this information. This is another consistency issue because the summary does not provide all the information that is included in the article.
3. Finally, the article states that several other people received minor injuries in the crash, but the summary does not mention this at all. This is a third consistency issue because the summary does not include all the information that is included in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it leaves out important details and includes inaccurate information (Aberdeenshire instead of Caithness).
