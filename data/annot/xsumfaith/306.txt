    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
    1. The summary states that the incident occurred in Aberdeenshire, but the article states that the incident occurred in Caithness, which is a different location.
    2. The summary mentions that the man was hit by a car, but the article does not mention any specific vehicle involved in the incident.
    3. The summary mentions that the man was taken to hospital, but the article does not mention any injuries or medical treatment received by the individuals involved.
    4. The article mentions that several other people received minor injuries in the crash, but the summary does not mention this.
    5. The article mentions that the road was closed and diversions were put in place, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article, such as the location and the details of the man's injuries.
