Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Sean Murdoch, the Pars goalkeeper, denied Jamie Adams in the first half. However, the summary does not mention anything about Adams or Murdoch. Consistency issue.
2. The article states that El Bakhtaoui scored two goals, but the summary only mentions one goal scored by El Bakhtaoui. Consistency issue.
3. The article states that the first goal was scored after El Bakhtaoui raced on to a Ryan Wallace ball, but the summary does not mention anything about Wallace. Consistency issue.
4. The article states that the second goal was scored from a Michael Paton cross, but the summary does not mention anything about Paton. Consistency issue.
5. The article states that Craig Moore fired a late chance over for Ayr United, but the summary does not mention anything about Moore or Ayr United. Consistency issue.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and there are several consistency issues.
