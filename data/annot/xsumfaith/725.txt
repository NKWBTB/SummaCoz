Craig Moore fired a late chance over for Ayr United, who remain third. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Faissal El Bakhtaoui netted a second-half double, but the article does not support this claim.

2. The article states that two quick-fire goals put the visitors (Dunfermline) in control, but the summary does not mention anything about two goals.

3. The summary mentions El Bakhtaoui scoring a stunning 30-yard volley, but the article states that he raced on to a Ryan Wallace ball to score his first goal, not a volley.

4. The article mentions that Craig Moore fired a late chance over for Ayr United, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions.
