    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "police have launched an investigation" after the man's body was found in a house in Kilmarnock.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about an investigation being launched. Instead, it states that two officers were seen at the property on Friday afternoon and that a post-mortem examination would be carried out to establish the exact cause of death.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that an investigation has been launched, while the article only mentions officers at the property and a post-mortem examination.
4. The article does mention that a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal, but this is not mentioned in the summary.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the information in the article.
