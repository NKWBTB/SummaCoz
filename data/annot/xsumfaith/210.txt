[
  "kilmarnock"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I can help you identify the consistency issues in the summary. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the body was found in a house in Glenfinnan Road, but the summary says "police have launched an investigation after a man's body was found in a house in kilmarnock."
2. Kilmarnock is a town in Scotland, but Glenfinnan Road is not located in Kilmarnock. The article specifically mentions Glenfinnan Road, which is a different location.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different location (Kilmarnock) than the one mentioned in the article (Glenfinnan Road).

So, the inconsistency issue is in the mention of "kilmarnock" in the summary, which is not supported by the article.
