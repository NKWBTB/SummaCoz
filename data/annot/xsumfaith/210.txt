</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the body of a 36-year-old was found in a house in Glenfinnan Road, but the summary only mentions Kilmarnock. The article does not mention Kilmarnock at all.
2. The article states that the body was found on Wednesday, but the summary only mentions a general "police investigation". There is no mention of when the investigation started or any other details about the timing of the investigation.
3. The article states that police have cordoned off the property and a post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish the exact cause of death, but the summary does not mention any of these details.
4. The article states that a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include any of the specific details mentioned in the article. The summary is too general and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
