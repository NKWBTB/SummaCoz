    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the restaurant has a special menu for pampered pooches to eat alongside their owners, implying that the dogs can eat inside the restaurant.
2. However, the article states that the restaurant began serving puppy platters after a new law was introduced allowing dogs to eat at restaurants - as long as they were outdoors! This means that dogs are not allowed to eat inside the restaurant.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the dogs can eat inside the restaurant, which is not allowed according to the new law.

So, the inconsistency is due to the fact that the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article.
