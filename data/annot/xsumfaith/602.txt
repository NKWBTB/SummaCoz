</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "a restaurant in new york has a special menu for pampered pooches to eat alongside their owners",
  "alongside their owners",
  "new york"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "a restaurant in new york has a special menu for pampered pooches to eat alongside their owners": The article does not mention anything about a special menu for pampered pooches. Instead, it states that the restaurant began serving puppy platters after a new law was introduced allowing dogs to eat at restaurants - as long as they were outdoors.
2. "alongside their owners": The article does not mention anything about owners eating alongside their dogs. It only mentions that dogs are allowed to eat at restaurants, but there is no mention of owners eating with their dogs.
3. "new york": The article does not specify the location of the restaurant. It only mentions that the new law allowing dogs to eat at restaurants was introduced in the UK.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions specific details that are not present in the article. The summary should only include information that is directly supported by the article.
