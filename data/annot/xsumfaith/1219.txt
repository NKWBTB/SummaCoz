    Summary: 
    pupils at a west yorkshire academy have been banned from wearing high-flying shoes after complaints they were made against them. 

    Article: 
    Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday, with almost 10% of pupils failing to reach the academy's standards.
Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures.
But Hanson Academy claims it "communicated clearly" its expectations for this school year.
Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers.
Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed.
Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday.
She said in an earlier statement: "We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.
"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.
"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn."
The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for "adult life".
She said: "This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect.
"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other.
"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school."
Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes.
She said: "It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather."
She said buying new shoes was not an easy option.
"I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important."
Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps.
"I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes," she said.
Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home.
Fiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: "Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00.
"So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon."
The school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents.
She said the school would work with parents who were struggling to dress their children appropriately.

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that pupils at Hanson Academy have been banned from wearing high-flying shoes, but the article does not mention anything about high-flying shoes. Instead, the article states that pupils are not allowed to wear certain types of footwear, such as trainers and patterned trousers.
2. The summary implies that the school's policy is solely focused on banning certain types of footwear, but the article explains that the school has a strict uniform policy that includes rules about hairstyles, jewelry, and indoor clothing, in addition to footwear.
3. The summary mentions that parents are upset about the new measures, but the article states that some parents have expressed concerns about how they were informed their children had been sent home, and one parent complained about the cost of buying new shoes. The article does not mention any widespread parental opposition to the school's policy.

Overall, the summary takes a specific aspect of the article (the ban on high-flying shoes) and exaggerates it to make it sound like the school's entire policy is focused on this one aspect. The article provides a more balanced view of the school's policy and the mixed feedback from parents.
