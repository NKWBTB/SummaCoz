Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15.
His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed "aggressively" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
"It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office," Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.
The teenager was described by his coach as "a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend".
Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.
If convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail.
Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: "We remain cautious. A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it's been [more than] 40 years since a cop was convicted in [Texas]."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the officer was charged with the murder of a teenage boy in the "us state of Dallas." However, the article states that the officer was charged with the murder of Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old boy, in Balch Springs, which is a suburb of Dallas.
2. The summary does not mention the name of the officer, Roy Oliver, or the fact that he was fired from his job as a police officer.
3. The summary does not mention the reason for the police response to the party, which was reportedly due to underage drinking.
4. The summary does not mention that the car was driving away from the officer when he fired his weapon, which is a crucial detail that contradicts the officer's initial claim that the car was reversing aggressively towards him.
5. The summary does not mention the four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon that Oliver was also charged with, in relation to the other four teenagers in the car.

Overall, the summary does not provide a consistent or accurate summary of the article. It does not include many key details and includes some inaccuracies, such as the location of the incident and the reason for the police response.
