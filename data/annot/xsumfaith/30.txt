Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15.
His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed "aggressively" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
"It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office," Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.
The teenager was described by his coach as "a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend".
Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.
If convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail.
Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: "We remain cautious. A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it's been [more than] 40 years since a cop was convicted in [Texas]."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the police officer was charged with the murder of a teenage boy, but the article does not mention the word "murder." Instead, the article states that the officer was fired and charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
2. The summary mentions that the officer was charged with murder, but it does not provide any details about the charges or the circumstances of the shooting. The article, on the other hand, provides specific details about the incident, including the fact that the officer fired into a car full of teenagers as they left a party, and that the victim was described by his coach as "a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend."
3. The summary does not mention the name of the victim, Jordan Edwards, or any of the other teenagers who were in the car. The article, however, provides the name of the victim and describes the other teenagers who were in the car.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the officer was fired from his job or that he faces up to 99 years in prison if convicted. The article, on the other hand, provides this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate details about the charges against the officer, the circumstances of the shooting, or the victim. The summary is too brief and lacks specific details, which makes it inconsistent with the article.
