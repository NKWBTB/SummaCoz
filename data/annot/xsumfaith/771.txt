He also cancelled an investigation into claims of abuse of power revealed by covert recordings, saying he wanted to "put an end to the agony" ahead of early elections in June.
But his move was condemned both by the opposition and by EU officials.
Macedonia has been in turmoil since the recordings were released in 2015.
In a televised address on Tuesday, President Ivanov said he acted to "defend national interests".
"I've decided to put an end to the agony and, metaphorically speaking, to cut a knot,'' he said, without referring to any politicians by name.
Opposition leader Zoran Zaev said the move was illegal, urging protesters to gather in the capital Skopje. A crowd of several hundred people later gathered outside the prosecutor's office.
Meanwhile, EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said: "Today's actions of President Ivanov are not in line with my understanding of rule of law."
Mr Hahn added that the move put Macedonia's EU membership ambitions at risk.
The crisis was sparked by covert recordings which appear to show ministers plotting vote-rigging and the cover-up of a murder.
Mr Zaev has been releasing a steady stream of recordings since February 2015, accusing the government of wiretapping 20,000 people, including politicians, journalists and religious leaders.
He says that scores of leaked recordings reveal corruption at the highest levels of government, including the mismanagement of funds, dubious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even cover-ups of killings.
The government denies the accusations, and in return has accused Mr Zaev of trying to "destabilise" the Balkan nation.
He rejects the claim.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "hahn has said he is ``not decided\\'\\'",
  "hahn has said he is ``not decided",
  "joko",
  "joko hahn",
  "not decided"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "hahn has said he is ``not decided\\'\\'": The summary incorrectly uses double backslashes (``\``) to indicate a single backslash (`\`). This is not a consistent use of syntax, as the rest of the summary uses single backslashes (``\``) to indicate escaping.
2. "hahn has said he is ``not decided"": The summary incorrectly omits the closing single quote (`'`) after "not decided". This is not a consistent use of syntax, as the rest of the summary uses closing single quotes to enclose quotes.
3. "joko": The summary incorrectly uses the name "joko" instead of "Ivanov", which is the correct name of the President of Macedonia. This is not a consistent use of syntax, as the rest of the summary uses the correct name.
4. "joko hahn": The summary incorrectly combines the names "joko" and "hahn" to create a new name. This is not a consistent use of syntax, as the rest of the summary uses separate names for each person.
5. "not decided": The summary incorrectly uses the phrase "not decided" instead of "undecided". This is not a consistent use of syntax, as the rest of the summary uses the correct phrase "undecided".

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues with the use of backslashes, single quotes, names, and phrasing.
