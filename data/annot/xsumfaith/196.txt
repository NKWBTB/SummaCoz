</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "league two side wycombe wanderers have signed torquay united midfielder angus macdonald on a two-year deal"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that MacDonald made 67 league appearances for National League club Torquay after signing in 2014. This means that he has been playing for Torquay for at least 4 years.
2. The summary states that Wycombe Wanderers have signed MacDonald on a two-year deal. This implies that MacDonald is leaving Torquay and joining Wycombe Wanderers.
3. However, the article does not mention anything about MacDonald leaving Torquay or joining Wycombe Wanderers. In fact, the article mentions that MacDonald has played for Reading and Wimbledon in the past, but it does not mention Wycombe Wanderers at all.
4. Therefore, the statement in the summary that MacDonald has signed a two-year deal with Wycombe Wanderers is not supported by the article. The article does not provide any information about MacDonald joining Wycombe Wanderers.

So, the consistency issue in the summary is that it mentions a two-year deal with Wycombe Wanderers, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions MacDonald's past clubs and his current club, Torquay United.
