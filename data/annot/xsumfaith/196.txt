    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Wycombe Wanderers have signed Angus MacDonald on a two-year deal, but the article does not mention any such deal.
2. The article mentions that MacDonald has played for Torquay United, Reading, and Wimbledon, but it does not mention Wycombe Wanderers.
3. The article does mention that MacDonald is a midfielder, but the summary does not provide any information about his position.
4. The article does not mention any transfer or signing of MacDonald by Wycombe Wanderers.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary likely contains incorrect or misleading information, and it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
