</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "derelict building in newport",
  "newport",
  "derelict"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "Derelict building in Newport": The article does not mention the word "derelict" or "Newport" at all. The article only mentions "Bloomery Circle, Llanwern".
2. "Newport": The article does not mention the word "Newport" at all. The article only mentions "Llanwern".
3. "Derelict": The article does not mention the word "derelict" at all. The article only mentions "scraped railway sleepers".

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary mentions "Newport" and "derelict building", neither of which are supported by the article.
