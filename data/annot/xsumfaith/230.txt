</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the fire burned for more than 10 hours, which suggests that the building was not derelict, as a derelict building would likely have been abandoned and unoccupied, and therefore the fire would have been extinguished more quickly.
2. The article also states that the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers, which suggests that the fire was not accidental, as it is unlikely that a derelict building would have a large amount of railway sleepers present.
3. The police have stated that the fire is believed to have been deliberately set, which further suggests that the building was not derelict, as it is unlikely that a derelict building would be the target of arson.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it states that the fire is at a derelict building, while the article states that the fire is at a building site and that the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers, suggesting that the fire was deliberately set.
