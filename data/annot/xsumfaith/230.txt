    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the fire at the derelict building in Newport is being treated as deliberate, but the article does not mention this.

2. The article only states that the fire is believed to have been deliberately set, which is not the same as saying it is being treated as deliberate.

3. The article mentions that the burning material included a large amount of scrapped railway sleepers, which could potentially have been the cause of the fire.

4. The article does not provide any information about the fire being intentionally set, and the Gwent Police spokesman's statement only says that the fire is believed to have been deliberately set, without providing any evidence or details.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the fire is being treated as deliberate, when the article only states that it is believed to have been deliberately set.

6. The summary may have been based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the article, or it may have been written based on additional information not provided in the article.
