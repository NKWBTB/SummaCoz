He had denied the charges but was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff George Way remitted the case to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because its greater sentencing powers.
Weatherhogg, formerly of Guthrie, near Forfar, was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with the man between 10 September, 2013 and 17 September the following year.
He was also convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on 25 December, 2014.
The woman told the trial she had felt "blackmailed" by Weatherhogg.
Lady Wolffe told the Weatherhogg that she had to pass a sentence on him that "reflected society's abhorrence" at such conduct.
The judge said that Weatherhogg, a first offender, had been assessed as posing "a moderate risk" of sexual re-offending.
Defence counsel Jonathan Crowe said it had been "a dramatic shock" for Weatherhogg to be placed on remand ahead of sentencing. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Based on the provided information, the summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The summary mentions the woman being sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against a woman and a woman, but the article does not mention any such sentence or offences.
2. The article only mentions Clive Weatherhogg being found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intentionally causing her sister and father to look at sexual images. There is no mention of the woman being sentenced to prison for sex offences.
3. The summary mentions the woman being sentenced to six years in prison, but the article only mentions Weatherhogg being found guilty and the case being remitted to the High Court in Edinburgh for sentencing.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article.
