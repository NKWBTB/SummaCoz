Clive Weatherhogg set up meetings between the woman and a man he found through an adult website, and filmed them having sex.
A court heard he sent a message containing a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day.
Weatherhogg, 42, was also placed on the sex offenders register.
He had denied the charges but was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff George Way remitted the case to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because its greater sentencing powers.
Weatherhogg, formerly of Guthrie, near Forfar, was found guilty of coercing the woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with the man between 10 September, 2013 and 17 September the following year.
He was also convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on 25 December, 2014.
The woman told the trial she had felt "blackmailed" by Weatherhogg.
Lady Wolffe told the Weatherhogg that she had to pass a sentence on him that "reflected society's abhorrence" at such conduct.
The judge said that Weatherhogg, a first offender, had been assessed as posing "a moderate risk" of sexual re-offending.
Defence counsel Jonathan Crowe said it had been "a dramatic shock" for Weatherhogg to be placed on remand ahead of sentencing.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "woman",
  "six years in prison"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I can help you identify the consistency issues in the summary. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The first inconsistency is in the word "woman". The article states that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man, but the summary only mentions "a woman". This is inconsistent because the article specifies that the victim is a specific woman, whereas the summary uses a more general term.
2. The second inconsistency is in the sentence "six years in prison". The article states that Weatherhogg was sentenced to six years in prison, but the summary does not mention the sentence. This is inconsistent because the summary does not provide all the information from the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide all the information and uses general terms instead of specific details.
