    Summary: 
    an elephant has died after being hit by a elephant at a zoo in the us state of idaho. 

    Article: 
    The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that an elephant died after being hit by another elephant at a zoo in Idaho. However, the article does not mention any elephant deaths. Instead, it reports that a girl was hit by a stone thrown by an elephant.
2. The summary incorrectly states that the elephant hit the girl, while the article correctly reports that the girl was hit by a stone thrown by the elephant.
3. The summary does not mention the stone or the fact that it was thrown by the elephant. Instead, it only mentions that the elephant died.
4. The article provides context and additional information about the incident, including the fact that the stone was thrown by the elephant, the girl's injuries, and the zoo's statement.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately report the events described in the article.

Overall, it appears that the summary was written based on incomplete or inaccurate information, and does not accurately reflect the events described in the article.
