The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement.
The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added.
The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual".

The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US:
Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual.
"It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do."
The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube.
The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground.
Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the elephant did not die, but the girl who was hit by the stone thrown by the elephant did die.

2. The summary states that an elephant died, which is not consistent with the article.

3. The article mentions that the elephant threw a stone and the girl was hit, but the summary states that an elephant died.

4. The article does not mention any death of an elephant, only the death of the girl.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it is likely that the summary is incorrect.
