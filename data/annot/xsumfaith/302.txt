Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident happened "near Dr Gray's Hospital." This implies that the incident occurred in the general vicinity of the hospital, but does not specify that it happened within the hospital itself.
2. The summary states that the man was "hit by a car in Moray." This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention the location of the incident as being in Moray.
3. The article does mention that the A96 was closed in the area for several hours, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article (the location of Moray) and omits information that is present in the article (the closure of the A96).
