    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was taken to hospital after being hit by a car in Moray.

However, the article does not mention Moray. Instead, it states that the incident happened near Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, which is in the Scottish council area of Moray.

2. The summary states that the man was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

The article does not provide any information about the severity of the man's injuries. It only states that he was taken to the hospital with what police described as serious but not life-threatening injuries.

3. The summary states that the A96 was closed in the area for several hours, but it has since reopened.

The article does not mention the A96 being closed or reopened. It only states that the incident happened near Dr Gray's Hospital and that the man was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides information that is not supported by the article. The article does not mention Moray, the severity of the man's injuries, or the A96 being closed or reopened.
