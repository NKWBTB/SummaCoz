    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the family of a man who died in a blaze at her home in canadian, canada, have said they are ``devastated\'\'by the blaze. 

    Article: 
    Marcy Smith was woken up by her son David to find their house in Glovertown, Newfoundland and Labrador, completely engulfed in flames.
The whole family was able to escape, but their house is destroyed and their dog and cats did not make it.
Mrs Smith said if it wasn't for her son, she and her daughter probably wouldn't have survived.
David was on FaceTime to his father at the time, so was the only one awake and saw the flames out of the corner of his eye.
"Within seconds of him getting us up, the flames were everywhere," Mrs Smith told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
"It happened so fast. We were standing in the kitchen by the wood stove and the flames just ate around me and David. The entire kitchen just disappeared while we were standing in it."
She said the fire was started by some rubbish she burned in the wood stove, something she had done "a thousand times" before. The fire alarm did not go off.
The family had nothing but pyjamas on when they fled, but Mrs Smith said the community has rallied behind them, donating clothes and shoes and even a bike for her son.
"All he understands is that me and his sister and him got out. He does not understand that he is the only reason we did," she said.
"He did a huge thing for such a young boy. I am so proud of him and I am going to tell him for the rest of his life until he understands what a big thing he did." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the given summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

1. The summary states that the family is "devastated" by the blaze, but the article does not mention any such word. Instead, the article states that the family escaped, but their house is destroyed and their pets did not make it.
2. The summary mentions that the fire was started by some rubbish that the mother burned in the wood stove, but the article does not provide any information about how the fire started.
3. The summary states that the family had nothing but pyjamas on when they fled, but the article mentions that the community has rallied behind them, donating clothes and shoes.
4. The summary mentions that the mother is "so proud" of her son for saving the family, but the article does not mention any such sentiment. Instead, the mother is quoted as saying that her son did a "huge thing" for such a young boy.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
