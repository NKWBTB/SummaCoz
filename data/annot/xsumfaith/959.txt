</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "a man has been arrested in connection with the rape of a 17-year-old girl in Birmingham."
2. The article states that "a man, 22, from Birmingham, was arrested on Wednesday and had now been bailed after being questioned by detectives."
3. The article does not mention the word "rape" or any connection to a 17-year-old girl.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim (the man was arrested in connection with the rape of a 17-year-old girl) that is not supported by the information in the article.
5. The article only mentions that the man was arrested and questioned by detectives, but it does not provide any information about the reason for his arrest or the nature of the alleged crime.
6. The article does mention that there were two separate incidents of rape, but it does not specify that the arrested man is connected to either of those incidents.
7. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and should not have been written based on the information provided in the article.
