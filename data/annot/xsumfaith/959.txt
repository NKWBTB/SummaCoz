A man has been charged and another man arrested in connection with the first attack, which is being treated as a separate incident, the force said.
Meanwhile, detectives continue to appeal for a Good Samaritan who picked up the victim after she was raped for the second time.
Police said the driver of the second vehicle, described as a people carrier-type car, is believed to have given the victim a lift home after she was raped a second time.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "17-year-old",
  "birmingham",
  NaN
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "17-year-old": The article states that the victim is a teenager, but it does not specify her age. The summary incorrectly states that she is 17 years old.
2. "birmingham": The article states that the rape took place in the Witton area of Birmingham, but the summary does not include this information.
3. NaN: The article does not mention a second attack, so there is no information to support the statement that the victim was raped twice.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the article and omits other important details.
