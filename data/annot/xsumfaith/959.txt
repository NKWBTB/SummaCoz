    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was arrested in connection with the rape of a 17-year-old girl in Birmingham.
2. The article states that the man was arrested in connection with the rape of the teenager in a vehicle in the Witton area at around 02:00 BST on 26 July.
3. However, the article also states that the girl had previously been raped at the railway station hours earlier. This information is not included in the summary.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the previous rape at the railway station.
5. Additionally, the article mentions that the driver of the second vehicle, described as a people carrier-type car, is believed to have given the victim a lift home after she was raped a second time. This information is also not included in the summary.
6. Therefore, the summary is not a complete and accurate representation of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details about the previous rape at the railway station and the Good Samaritan who picked up the victim after the second rape.
