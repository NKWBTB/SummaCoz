    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    west ham\'s # [UNK] m euros (Â # [UNK] m) stake in west ham united\'s # [UNK] m euros (Â # [UNK] m) investment have been approved by the club. 

    Article: 
    It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club.
Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.
Between them they now own more than 85% of the club.
Since August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
Last year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that West Ham's £200m investment has been approved by the club, but the article does not mention anything about the club approving such an investment. Instead, it talks about the possibility of a takeover by an energy drinks giant.
2. The summary mentions that Sullivan and Gold own a majority stake in West Ham, but the article states that they own more than 85% of the club. This discrepancy suggests that the summary is not accurate.
3. The summary also mentions that the investment is in euros, but the article is written in pounds sterling. This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The article does not mention anything about West Ham's stake being sold to clear debts, as stated in the summary.

Therefore, based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article and should not be trusted.
