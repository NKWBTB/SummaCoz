Find out why.

<Article>
It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club.
Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.
Between them they now own more than 85% of the club.
Since August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
Last year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that West Ham United's £200m investment has been approved by the club.
2. The article does not mention any investment of £200m from West Ham United. Instead, it mentions a potential £200m takeover offer from an energy drinks giant.
3. The article also states that Sullivan and Gold own a majority stake in West Ham United, valued at £105m, and that they have been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a £200m investment from West Ham United, which is not supported by the article.
5. The article does mention the possibility of a minority shareholding being sold to clear debts, but this is not the same as a £200m investment.
6. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not reflect the content of the article.
