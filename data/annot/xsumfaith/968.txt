<Article>
It had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the Premier League club.
Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.
Between them they now own more than 85% of the club.
Since August's move to London Stadium, West Ham have also been linked with takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups.
Last year Sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and Gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for West Ham United, but it does not mention any approval of investment or stake in the club.
2. The summary states that "west ham's # [UNK] m euros (Â # [UNK] m) stake in west ham united's # [UNK] m euros (Â # [UNK] m) investment have been approved by the club." This statement is not supported by the article.
3. The article mentions that Sullivan and Gold bought a majority stake in West Ham in 2010, and that they now own more than 85% of the club. However, the article does not mention any approval of investment or stake in the club.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions approval of investment and stake in the club, which is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the consistency issues in the summary are:

* The statement "west ham's # [UNK] m euros (Â # [UNK] m) stake in west ham united's # [UNK] m euros (Â # [UNK] m) investment have been approved by the club" is not supported by the article.
* The article does not mention any approval of investment or stake in the club.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
