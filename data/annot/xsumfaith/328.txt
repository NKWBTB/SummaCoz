    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article title mentions "the future of robots" and the series is about Ricky traveling the country to meet the robots of the future and the scientists working on them.
2. The summary only mentions "talking about the future of robots" which is a very broad and general statement that does not provide any specific information about the content of the article.
3. The article is focused on the changing relationship between humans and robots, and how our lives are being affected by the increasing presence of robots in our daily lives.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the changing relationship between humans and robots, or how our lives are being affected by robots.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any specific information about the content of the article, and it does not capture the main focus of the article which is the changing relationship between humans and robots.
