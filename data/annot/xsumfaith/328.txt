[
  "we\\'ve been telling newsround to talk",
  NaN
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is about Ricky traveling the country to meet robots and scientists working on them, and the future of robots.
2. The summary states "we've been telling newsround to talk about the future of robots."
3. There is no mention of "newsround" in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it references something that is not present in the article.

The inconsistency is in the second span, which is NaN (Not a Number), indicating that there is no valid information in that span.
