Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
1. The summary states that Phil Wilson has been signed by Grimsby Town on a one-year deal, but the article does not mention anything about Grimsby Town or a one-year deal.
2. The article states that Wilson was released by Preston North End in May, but the summary mentions that he was released by League Two rivals Preston North End, which is not consistent with the article.
3. The article mentions that Wilson has previously played for Notts County, but the summary does not mention anything about Notts County.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions.
