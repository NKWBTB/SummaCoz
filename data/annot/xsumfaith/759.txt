    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:

1. The article states that Wilson rejoined Championship side Forest from Celtic for £2.5m in August 2013. This means that he was already playing for Forest at the time, and not with Preston North End as stated in the summary.
2. The article also states that Wilson has been without a team since being released in May. This means that he is currently a free agent and has not signed with Grimsby Town, as stated in the summary.
3. The summary mentions that Wilson has signed a one-year deal with Grimsby Town, but there is no mention of this in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it falsely states that Wilson has signed with Grimsby Town, when in fact he is currently a free agent and has not signed with any team.
