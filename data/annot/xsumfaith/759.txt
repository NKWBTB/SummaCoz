Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Wilson rejoined Championship side Forest from Celtic for £2.5m in August 2013. This means that he was not playing for Preston North End at that time, as Preston North End is a League Two team and Forest is a Championship team.
2. The summary states that Wilson was released by Preston North End, which is a League Two team. This is inconsistent with the article, which states that he rejoined Forest in August 2013 and was not playing for Preston North End at that time.
3. Additionally, the summary states that Wilson has signed a one-year deal with Grimsby Town, which is also a League Two team. This is inconsistent with the article, which states that Wilson was released by Forest in May and does not mention him signing with any other team.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Wilson was released by Preston North End and signed with Grimsby Town, which is not supported by the information in the article.
