Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man appeared in court charged with stealing "£572,206 from a former football club chairman."
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the man stealing money from a former football club chairman. Instead, it states that he is accused of stealing £572,206 from Patrick Bradley Ltd, a quarry firm based in Kilrea, County Londonderry.
3. The article also mentions that the accused, Johnny McGurk, is an accountant and was released on bail.
4. The summary does not mention any information about the accused's profession or bail status.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the charges against Johnny McGurk and omits important details such as his profession and bail status.

Conclusion: The summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content. It contains inaccuracies and omissions that make it inconsistent with the original article.
