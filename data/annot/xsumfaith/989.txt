Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Johnny McGurk was accused of stealing £572,206 from Patrick Bradley Ltd, but the summary only mentions "# [UNK] from a former football club chairman." There is a discrepancy in the amount stolen, as the article states a specific amount while the summary only mentions a vague amount.
2. The article states that Johnny McGurk was accused of 36 counts of fraud, but the summary does not mention fraud at all. This is a significant inconsistency, as fraud is a key aspect of the article's charges against McGurk.
3. The article states that McGurk was accused of stealing money between 2006 and 2011, but the summary only mentions "also died" without providing any context or timeframe. This is an inconsistency in the information provided, as the article focuses on the theft and fraud charges while the summary only mentions McGurk's death.

Overall, the summary does not provide consistent information with the article. The discrepancies in the amount stolen, the lack of mention of fraud, and the out-of-context mention of McGurk's death all indicate that the summary is not a reliable representation of the article's content.
