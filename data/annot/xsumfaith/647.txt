</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that defender Dorian Dervite has signed a new one-year contract with Bolton.
2. However, the article states that Dervite made 14 appearances last season and helped the team finish second in League One and secure promotion.
3. This suggests that Dervite is already a member of the Bolton team and has been playing for them for some time, rather than signing a new contract.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Dervite is signing a new contract when in fact he is already a member of the team.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it implies that Dervite is signing a new contract when in fact he is already a member of the team.
