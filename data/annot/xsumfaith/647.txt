    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that defender Dorian Dervite has signed a new one-year contract with Bolton.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about a new one-year contract. Instead, it states that Dervite has made 14 appearances last season and has been a key player in Bolton's promotion to the Championship.
3. The article also mentions that Dervite joined Bolton from Charlton in 2014 and has made 83 appearances in all competitions.
4. Based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that Dervite is an existing player for Bolton and has been with the club for several years, not a new signing as suggested in the summary.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Dervite is a new signing when in fact he is an existing player.
