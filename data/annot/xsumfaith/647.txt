Dervite follows David Wheater, Gary Madine and Jem Karacan in signing new contracts with Bolton, following their promotion to the Championship.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "defender",
  "defender dorian dervite has signed a new one-year contract with bolton",
  "one-year"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "defender" - The article does not mention the word "defender" to describe Dorian Dervite. The article uses the phrase "French centre-back" to describe Dervite's position.
2. "defender dorian dervite has signed a new one-year contract with bolton" - The article does not mention the word "one-year" to describe the length of Dervite's new contract. The article states that Dervite has signed a new contract, but it does not provide the length of the contract.
3. "one-year" - The article does not provide any information about the length of Dervite's new contract. The summary is incorrect to state that the contract is for one year.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article. Specifically, the summary includes the words "defender" and "one-year" which are not supported by the article.
