    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Dame Sarah Storey won her second UCI road cycling world championships title, but the article does not mention any world championships. Instead, it mentions that she won a road race in Nottwil, Switzerland.
2. The summary states that Storey won her second title, implying that she has won only two titles, but the article mentions that she has won 21 world titles across both sports (cycling and swimming).
3. The summary states that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the article does not mention anything about the Paralympics or Rio de Janeiro.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations.
