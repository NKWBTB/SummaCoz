<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a girl has been spotted on a yacht in the north sea, according to a new study. 

    Article: 
    21 October 2016 Last updated at 15:03 BST
In 2008, about 40 were recorded on the seahorse study site at South Beach in the bay, but none have been spotted there since 2013.
Miranda Krestovnikoff has been investigating for Inside Out and speaking to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, and the Royal Yachting Association's Emma Barton. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "none have been spotted there (South Beach) since 2013." This means that there have been no sightings of seahorses at South Beach since 2013.
2. The summary states that a girl has been spotted on a yacht in the North Sea. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a yacht or a girl in the article.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

The reason for this inconsistency is that the summary is not based on the information provided in the article. The article does not mention a yacht or a girl, but the summary does. This is why the summary is not consistent with the article.
