    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is dated March 23, 2017, which means it is from the past.
2. The article does not mention any protests or demonstrations in Cardiff or anywhere else in the UK.
3. The article is about the UK government's decision to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the process of leaving the EU.
4. The summary states that thousands of people have taken to the streets of Cardiff to protest against the government's decision to leave the EU.
5. However, the article does not mention any such protests or demonstrations in Cardiff or anywhere else in the UK.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of any protests or demonstrations in the article, whereas the summary states that such protests have taken place in Cardiff.
