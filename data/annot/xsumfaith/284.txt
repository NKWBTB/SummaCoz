For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "thousands of people have taken to the streets of cardiff to protest against the government\\'s decision to leave the eu"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is dated March 23, 2017, which is after the UK's Brexit referendum that took place on June 23, 2016.
2. The summary states that "thousands of people have taken to the streets of Cardiff to protest against the government's decision to leave the EU."
3. However, the article does not mention anything about protests in Cardiff or any other city in the UK. Instead, it reports on the government's announcement of a new bill that aims to repeal the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new bill that will "ensure that human rights laws are not used to undermine the sovereignty of Parliament."
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different topic (protests in Cardiff) than the topic of the article (the government's announcement of a new bill to repeal the Human Rights Act).

Overall, the inconsistency between the summary and the article is due to the fact that the summary mentions a different topic than the article, which indicates that the summary was not accurately written based on the content of the article.
