</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article is dated March 23, 2017, which is after the UK's referendum on leaving the EU, which took place on June 23, 2016.
2. The summary states that thousands of people have taken to the streets of Cardiff to protest against the government's decision to leave the EU.
3. However, the article is from March 2017, and the UK had already decided to leave the EU by then. The article does not mention any protests or opposition to the government's decision to leave the EU.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of protests or opposition to the government's decision to leave the EU in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that the article does not mention any protests or opposition to the government's decision to leave the EU, while the summary states that thousands of people have taken to the streets of Cardiff to protest against the government's decision.
