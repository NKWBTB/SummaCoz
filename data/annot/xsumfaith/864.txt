    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a haul of alcohol seized in china\'s guangxi province has been arrested in china, a court in china has ruled. 

    Article: 
    More than 5,300 bottles of alcohol were seized by the investigators in the southern city of Liuzhou.
They also found packets of a white powder called Sildenafil, better known as the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
Police in the Guangxi region are now investigating the two distillers.
The Liuzhou Food and Drug Administration said (in Chinese) that the powder was added to three different types of 'baijiu' - a strong, clear spirit that is the most popular drink in China.
They said the haul was worth up to 700,000 yuan (Â£72,000; $113,000).
Doctors recommend that adults requiring prescription should take only one dose of Viagra a day, with a lower dose for those over the age of 65.
China continues to face widespread food safety problems.
In June, police in cities across China seized more than 100,000 tonnes of smuggled meat, some of which was more than 40 years old.
The 2008 tainted milk scandal outraged the nation.
Some 300,000 people were affected and at least six babies died after consuming milk adulterated with melamine. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a haul of alcohol has been arrested in China, but the article does not mention any arrests. Instead, it talks about an investigation into two distillers.
2. The summary mentions that the haul was worth up to 700,000 yuan, but the article does not provide any information about the value of the seized alcohol.
3. The summary mentions that the powder found in the alcohol was Viagra, but the article only mentions that the powder was a white substance and did not identify it as Viagra.
4. The summary states that doctors recommend that adults should take only one dose of Viagra a day, but the article does not provide any information about the recommended dosage of Viagra.
5. The summary mentions that China continues to face widespread food safety problems, but the article does not provide any information about this.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not present in the article, and omits other important information that is present in the article.
