    Summary: 
    a taxi driver who took photographs of a hen party in scotland has been described as a ``hen party\'\'. 

    Article: 
    Ryan Walls took pictures of 101 passengers during the Edinburgh Festival in 2015.
The 42-year-old said only two people refused out of the 103 people he asked due to being in a hurry and having a bad hair day.
Now the father-of-three's pictures will go on display at Out of the Blue Drill Hall, Dalmeny Street, in August.
Mr Walls told the BBC Scotland news website how he took photographs of a hen party, stag do, football fans, a chef, a high court judge and a TV agony aunt from Kuwait.
He said: "Everyone was so nice. One of the pictures is of a passenger who was in such a hurry that he couldn't wait for another taxi when I discovered the central locking system was broken so I had to pull him in and out of the taxi window.
"I also had an elderly former English teacher who had suddenly decided she wanted to go out to a show at the festival at the last minute and she had lots of words of encouragement for me so I really enjoyed chatting with her.
"I also got a Jambo fan and was worried I wasn't going to get a Hibs fan but luckily I did.
"I'm really interested in people and wanted to capture that moment in my cab, I only had seconds to take a few pictures and I'm really pleased with the end result."
The exhibition runs from 31 July until 5 August. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the taxi driver, Ryan Walls, was described as a "hen party". However, the article does not mention anything about Ryan Walls being a hen party.
2. The article only mentions that Ryan Walls took photographs of his passengers during the Edinburgh Festival in 2015. There is no mention of him being a hen party or any other type of party.
3. The summary also mentions that Ryan Walls took pictures of a hen party, but this is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that he took pictures of 101 passengers, including a hen party, but does not specify that he was a part of the hen party.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Ryan Walls is a hen party, which is not supported by the text.
