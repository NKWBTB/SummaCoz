Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "harry potter star harry potter and star wars star harry potter have had his caravan stolen."
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Harry Potter having a caravan stolen.
3. The article only mentions that Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third Star Wars movie, had his touring caravan stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Harry Potter, who is a fictional character, having a caravan stolen, while the article only mentions a real person, Davis, having his caravan stolen.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and is not supported by the information in the article.
