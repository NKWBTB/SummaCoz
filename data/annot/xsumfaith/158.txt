The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night.
Davis tweeted "My touring caravan was stolen.. even though it was locked up with hitch & wheel lock! I want to swear... #rotters".
He added the thieves could have "headed north or south on A1, or west on A14".
Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have had a report of a caravan being stolen in the Yaxley area between 5pm on Thursday and 12.45pm on Friday. We are investigating."
Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII.
Davis's credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian.
Anyone with information about the caravan is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "harry potter star harry potter and star wars star harry potter have had his caravan stolen."
2. The article does not mention anything about Harry Potter being a star in Star Wars. In fact, the article only mentions that Davis, the owner of the stolen caravan, has appeared in the Harry Potter and Star Wars franchises.
3. Therefore, the phrase "star harry potter" in the summary is inconsistent with the article, as there is no mention of Harry Potter being a star in Star Wars.
4. Additionally, the phrase "star harry potter" is redundant, as "Harry Potter" is already a well-known character and there is no need to qualify him as a "star."

Overall, the inconsistency in the summary is due to the incorrect information about Harry Potter's role in Star Wars, and the redundant phrasing of "star harry potter."
