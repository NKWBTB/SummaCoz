<Article>
The eight-day hearing in Ebbw Vale is examining the request to take over 250 hectares (600 acres) of common land.
Backers, including Blaenau Gwent council, have offered around 320 hectares (800 acres) replacement land.
The inquiry has heard conflicting accounts from experts over claims the circuit would damage habitats and plant life by building on the common land.
Natural Resources Wales said it was "difficult to conclude" that the replacement land was of equal value, but it was not opposing the development overall.
But an ecology report presented by the developers said there would be a "net gain" in biodiversity because the plans included work to enhance other habitats nearby - which the Gwent wildlife trust argued against.
The Planning Inspectorate for Wales will make a recommendation after the inquiry in Ebbw vale, before Welsh government ministers have the final say on whether the plans can go ahead.

  "given the go-ahead",
  "325m",
  "# 325m"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "given the go-ahead": The article does not mention anything about the plans being given the go-ahead. Instead, it states that the inquiry is ongoing and that the Planning Inspectorate for Wales will make a recommendation after the inquiry, which will then be reviewed by Welsh government ministers. Therefore, the phrase "given the go-ahead" is not consistent with the article.
2. "325m": The article mentions the length of the circuit as "around 320 hectares" (800 acres), but not "325m". The discrepancy could be due to a conversion error or a typo in the summary.
3. "# 325m": The article does not mention the hashtag symbol (#) anywhere, so this is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the inconsistencies are in the phrases "given the go-ahead", "325m", and "# 325m".
