    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a former councillor has appeared in court charged with possessing indecent images of children. 

    Article: 
    Hull city councillor Steven Bayes also pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image when he appeared at the city's crown court.
The 55-year-old was suspended from the Labour Party in October after it "became aware of a police investigation into him", a party spokesman said.
He was released on unconditional bail and is due to stand trial on 5 February 2018 at the same court.
Mr Bayes was first elected as a councillor in 1985.
He was involved in Hull's bid to secure the UK City of Culture title and is a former vice chair of the Hull 2017 company, which is organising arts activities and events for the year-long celebration. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the former councillor was charged with possessing indecent images of children.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about indecent images of children. Instead, it states that the councillor was charged with possessing an extreme pornographic image.
3. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it omits the fact that the councillor was charged with possessing an extreme pornographic image and instead focuses on indecent images of children.
4. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not provide a consistent summary of the article's content.
