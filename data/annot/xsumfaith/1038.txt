    Summary: 
    bradford were held to a draw by league one strugglers oldham in the first round of the fa cup. 

    Article: 
    Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header.
Bradford dominated the rest of the opening period as the visitors' defence survived a series of narrow escapes.
Keeper Connor Ripley made a brilliant one-handed save to deny winger Mark Marshall, Timothee Dieng and Josh Cullen both had shots deflected for corners, and Billy Clarke missed a good chance when he turned James Meredith's cross wide.
Oldham somehow held their lead until half-time, but Bradford deservedly equalised after 57 minutes when Ousmane Fane dragged Cullen to the ground and Clarke scored from the spot.
Bradford continued to dominate, but could not turn possession into goals as Oldham's defence held firm.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Oldham were held to a draw by Bradford, while the article states that Bradford were held to a draw by Oldham.
2. The summary mentions that Oldham dominated the first half, while the article states that Bradford dominated the first half.
3. The summary does not mention the penalty awarded to Bradford, which led to their equalizing goal.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the events of the match. The article provides more detailed information about the game, including the fact that Bradford dominated the first half, Oldham scored a goal in the fifth minute, and Bradford equalized with a penalty in the second half. The summary, on the other hand, provides a brief and inaccurate summary of the match.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Bradford were held to a draw by Oldham, while the article states that Oldham were held to a draw by Bradford.
