    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a russian investigation is under way into the downing of a russian warplane by turkey on saturday. 

    Article: 
    The "black box" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats.
Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing.
Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit.
An analysis is expected to be released next week.
The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response.
Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace.
Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of "creeping Islamisation".
What we know about how the Su-24 was downed
How Russia's sanctions could hit Turkey
The war of words as it erupted
The two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November.
Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued.
A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground.
Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a Russian investigation is underway into the downing of a Russian warplane by Turkey, but the article does not mention any investigation.
2. The article focuses on the opening of the "black box" of the Su-24 jet and the expected analysis to be released next week, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary states that the downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, but the article does not mention any crisis or sanctions imposed by Russia.
4. The summary mentions that the Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on November 24, but the article does not provide any information about the downing of the jet.
5. The summary mentions that Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and imposed sanctions, but the article does not mention any apology or sanctions.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not present in the article and omits other important information that is present in the article.
