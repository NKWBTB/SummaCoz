It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
Find out why.

<Article>
The "black box" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats.
Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, said flight information appeared to be missing.
Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit.
An analysis is expected to be released next week.
The downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, with Moscow imposing sanctions in response.
Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace.
Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of "creeping Islamisation".
What we know about how the Su-24 was downed
How Russia's sanctions could hit Turkey
The war of words as it erupted
The two countries are heavily involved in Syria but take radically different positions despite both being ostensibly opposed to the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
The Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November.
Both crew members ejected but the pilot was killed, apparently by militants on the ground while the navigator was rescued.
A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew was also killed and a helicopter destroyed on the ground.
Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and in the meantime has imposed sanctions including a ban on package holidays, which could cost Turkey billions of dollars.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "saturday",
  "turkey",
  "warplane"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "saturday" - The article states that the Su-24 jet was downed on November 24th, not on a Saturday. The summary is inconsistent with the article because it mentions the day of the week as "Saturday" when the actual day was a Wednesday.
2. "turkey" - The article mentions that the Su-24 was downed by F-16 fighters, but the summary only mentions "Turkey" without specifying the entity that downed the plane. This is inconsistent with the article because it implies that Turkey downed the plane, which is not accurate.
3. "warplane" - The article uses the term "Su-24 jet" to refer to the downed plane, while the summary uses the term "warplane". This is inconsistent with the article because it implies that the downed plane was a generic "warplane" rather than a specific type of aircraft (the Su-24).

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that change the meaning of the original text.
