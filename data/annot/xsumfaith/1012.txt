    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Belfast Giants beat the Nottingham Panthers 4-2 away to win the Elite League title on Saturday night.
2. However, the article states that the Giants got a short-handed opener through player-coach Derrick Walser, but Jeff Dimmen pulled the Panthers level.
3. The article does not mention the Giants winning the game 4-2, nor does it mention them winning the Elite League title.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains information that is not supported by the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains a false statement about the Giants winning the game and the title.
