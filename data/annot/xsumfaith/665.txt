<Article>
Santner, 24, broke his finger in only his second game for the county in 2016.
"There is some unfinished business with Mitch," director of cricket Steve Rhodes told Worcestershire's website.
"Last summer he was very unlucky. Losing Mitch was a massive blow to our hopes of qualifying. We'd had a good start and him playing all those games would have been an extra bonus for us."
The left-arm batsman and spinner, who made his Test debut in 2015, will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England.
Santner added: "I really enjoyed my time at Worcester with a great bunch of lads and it was so frustrating for me to pick up that injury in the very first T20 game.
"It's fantastic that I've got the chance to come back again next summer and hopefully I can make up for lost time and make an impact with bat and ball."
In August, Worcestershire signed Australia pace bowler John Hastings as their main overseas player for the 2017 season across all formats of the game.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "mitchell",
  "2017 t20 blast competition",
  "re-signed new zealand"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "mitchell" - The article never mentions the word "mitchell" on its own. The correct word is "Mitchell Santner", which is mentioned in the article as the name of the cricketer. Therefore, the summary should have written "Mitchell Santner" instead of just "mitchell".
2. "2017 t20 blast competition" - The article states that Santner will rejoin the Rapids following June's ICC Trophy in England, but it does not mention the 2017 T20 Blast competition. The correct information would be that Santner will rejoin the Rapids for the 2017 season, but the article does not specify which competitions he will play in. Therefore, the summary should not have included "2017 t20 blast competition".
3. "re-signed new zealand" - The article does not mention anything about Santner being signed by Worcestershire from New Zealand. The correct information would be that Santner made his Test debut for New Zealand in 2015, but the article does not mention his current status or where he is playing. Therefore, the summary should not have included "re-signed new zealand".

Overall, the summary has several consistency issues that need to be addressed to accurately reflect the information in the article.
