     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Great Britain's Jung Jung won Olympic gold in the men's fox-pitt, but the article does not mention any athlete named Jung Jung.
2. The summary mentions that Jung won aboard Sam, but the article does not mention any horse named Sam.
3. The summary states that France's Astier Nicolas took silver and American Phillip Dutton won bronze, but the article does not mention any medal winners by name. Instead, it states that GB's William Fox-Pitt finished 12th.
4. The summary mentions that Fox-Pitt was competing just 10 months after being placed in an induced coma, but the article does not mention any such information.
5. The summary mentions that Fox-Pitt produced a faultless performance in the final show-jumping phase, but the article states that he incurred several time penalties in the cross-country phase.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains several inaccuracies and misleading information.
