</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "great britain\\'s jung jung won olympic gold in the men\\'s fox-pitt at the rio olympics"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Great Britain's William Fox-Pitt finished 12th in the men's event, not that Great Britain won Olympic gold.

2. The summary states that Great Britain won Olympic gold, which is not supported by the article.

3. The article does not mention a rider named "Jung Jung" or any other rider winning Olympic gold.

4. The article does mention that Fox-Pitt was competing just 10 months after being placed in an induced coma following a fall, but the summary does not include this information.

5. The article mentions that Fox-Pitt led after the dressage phase but dropped to 21st after incurring several time penalties in the cross-country phase, which is not mentioned in the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it falsely states that Great Britain won Olympic gold and does not accurately represent the performance of William Fox-Pitt.
