The Seasiders struck with the first real chance after 12 minutes as Nathan Delfouneso jinked past his man and delivered a pinpoint chip into the area, where Jamille Matt turned the ball home from three yards.
Blackpool goalkeeper Sam Slocombe denied Matthew Briggs with a sensational save to push the ball behind after 17 minutes, but the visitors did equalise from the resulting corner as Kurtis Guthrie prodded in from close range after a goalmouth scramble.
Somehow, Colchester failed to re-take the lead on the stroke of half-time as Slocombe produced a brilliant save from George Elokobi's close-range effort, before Guthrie headed against the bar from two yards.
Blackpool should have clinched the win 15 minutes from time, as Tom Aldred was found unmarked from a corner, but he headed wide from eight yards.
Colchester finished the game with 10 men, after substitute Sean Murray was shown a straight red for a bad tackle on Jim McAlister in injury time.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "guthrie scored his first goal of the season",
  "colchester",
  "move into the league two play-off places"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "guthrie scored his first goal of the season" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention Sean Guthrie scoring a goal. In fact, the article mentions that Kurtis Guthrie scored the equalizing goal for Colchester United.
2. "colchester" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the team that played was Colchester United, not just "colchester".
3. "move into the league two play-off places" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention anything about Colchester United moving into play-off places. The article only mentions the final score of the match and the players involved in the game.

Overall, the summary has several inconsistencies with the article, including the names of the players and the teams, and the final score of the match. It is important to carefully read and fact-check the article before creating a summary to ensure accuracy and consistency.
