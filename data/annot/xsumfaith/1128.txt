    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the woman who died was 18 years old, while the article states that she was from Kinross. This is inconsistent because Kinross is a town in Scotland, and it is unlikely that an 18-year-old woman from Scotland would be hit by a car in east London.
2. The summary states that the woman died after being hit by a car outside an address in South Street, Milnathort, on Tuesday. However, the article does not mention any specific location or day of the week.
3. The summary states that the police said the woman's family was upset at their loss and that she would be greatly missed. However, the article does not mention the police making any statements.

Therefore, based on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the woman who died was 18 years old. However, the article does not mention the age of the died woman.
2. The summary states that the woman was hit by a car in east london in east london, while the article states that the woman was hit by a car outside an address in South Street, Milnathort. It is unclear if Milnathort is located in east london.
