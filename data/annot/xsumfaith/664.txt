<Article>
Neil Aspin's promotion-chasing hosts have not lost in nine National League matches while Adam Lockwood's side are unbeaten in five.
Guiseley went ahead on 15 minutes against the run of play when a throw-in found James Hurst who squared to Jake Lawlor to stroke into an empty net.
Gateshead defender Liam Hogan superbly blocked Jordan Preston's effort and Guiseley keeper Jonny Maxted then saved well from Wesley York's shot just before the break.
The hosts, who started the second half well, levelled on 62 minutes when a slip by half-time substitute Derek Asamoah let York curl sweetly into the top-right corner from the edge of the box.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that "gateshead and guiseley extended their unbeaten runs with a 1-1 draw at the gateshead international stadium." However, the article states that Gateshead lost the match 1-1, not drew.
2. The summary does not provide any information about the match, such as the goalscorers or the performance of the teams. The article, on the other hand, provides detailed information about the match, including the goalscorers and the key events.
3. The summary is too brief and lacks important details. The article, on the other hand, provides a more comprehensive report of the match, including the starting lineups, the key events, and the goalscorers.

Therefore, based on the above reasons, the provided summary is not consistent with the article.
