     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Gateshead and Guiseley extended their unbeaten runs with a 1-1 draw, but the article states that Gateshead had not lost in nine National League matches, while Guiseley were unbeaten in five. This implies that Gateshead had a longer unbeaten run than Guiseley, which is not consistent with the summary.
2. The summary mentions that Guiseley went ahead on 15 minutes, but the article states that Gateshead defender Liam Hogan superbly blocked Jordan Preston's effort and Guiseley keeper Jonny Maxted then saved well from Wesley York's shot just before the break. This suggests that Guiseley did not score until after the break, which is not consistent with the summary.
3. The summary states that Gateshead levelled on 62 minutes, but the article states that Gateshead defender Gus Mafuta was shown the yellow card just before the break. This suggests that the goal was scored before the break, which is not consistent with the summary.
4. The summary mentions that Guiseley substitute Michael Rankine replaced Jordan Preston, but the article states that Preston was the scorer of the goal. This is not consistent with the summary.
5. The summary states that the match ended in a 1-1 draw, but the article states that the match ended with a goal from Wes York for Gateshead. This is not consistent with the summary.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains errors and inconsistencies in the details of the match.
