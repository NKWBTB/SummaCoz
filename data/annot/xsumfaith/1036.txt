    Summary: 
    former nfl star tom phillips has been jailed for three years for assaulting an american football player. 

    Article: 
    Officials believe Lawrence Phillips, 40, killed himself early on Wednesday.
In the 1990s, he was a star player at the University of Nebraska, making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL.
Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field.
After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law.
Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers.
In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend.
Phillips, who was serving a term of more than 30 years, had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate.
On Tuesday, a judge found that there was enough evidence to try Phillips in the death of Damion Soward, 37.
It is unclear how he took his own life.
"He was an intelligent person and had some good qualities," Tom Osborne, his coach at Nebraska, told the Associated Press news agency.
"Yet he had some anger issues and couldn't overcome the demons in his life.'' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Tom Phillips was jailed for three years for assaulting an American football player, but the article does not mention anything about Tom Phillips being jailed or assaulting anyone.
2. The article states that Lawrence Phillips, not Tom Phillips, was the former NFL player who died by suicide.
3. The summary is incorrect in stating that Lawrence Phillips assaulted an American football player, as the article does not mention any such incident.
4. The article does mention that Lawrence Phillips had a history of legal troubles and was serving a prison sentence for assaulting a former girlfriend and driving his car into a group of teenagers.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it contains incorrect information about Lawrence Phillips' criminal history and the circumstances of his death.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Tom Phillips was jailed for three years for assaulting an American football player, but the article does not mention anything about Tom Phillips being jailed or assaulting anyone.
2. The article states that Lawrence Phillips, not Tom Phillips, was the former NFL player who died by suicide.
