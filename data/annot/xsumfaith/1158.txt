    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    three people have been treated in hospital after being attacked by three youths in a kent restaurant. 

    Article: 
    The victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury at about 02:15 GMT on Friday when the assault occurred.
Investigating officers said three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people.
It is believed one of the group then set light to the woman's hair.
Officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack.
Det Sgt Barry Carr said: "Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse.
"This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "three people have been treated in hospital after being attacked by three youths in a Kent restaurant." However, the article only mentions one victim who had their hair set on fire, and there is no mention of any other people being attacked or taken to the hospital.
2. The summary does not mention anything about the victim's hair being set on fire, which is a significant detail that is mentioned in the article.
3. The article states that the attack occurred when three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people, and that one of the group set the victim's hair on fire. The summary does not include this information.
4. The article emphasizes the danger of the attack and the potential for it to have turned out much worse, but the summary does not convey this sense of urgency or danger.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the details of the attack and the potential danger involved.
