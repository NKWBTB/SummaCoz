Find out why.

<Article>
The victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury at about 02:15 GMT on Friday when the assault occurred.
Investigating officers said three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people.
It is believed one of the group then set light to the woman's hair.
Officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack.
Det Sgt Barry Carr said: "Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse.
"This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "the victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury" which implies that there was only one victim, not three people.
2. The article also states that "three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people" which suggests that there were only three individuals involved in the assault, not three youths.
3. The article further states that "one of the group then set light to the woman's hair" which indicates that only one person was responsible for the assault, not three youths.
4. The article does not mention anyone being treated in hospital, which contradicts the summary.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that three people were attacked and treated in hospital, when in fact, according to the article, only one victim was assaulted and fortunately, was not seriously hurt.
