The Dons loaned Smith, 21, to United in July and he has five goals this season.
Scotland Under-21 cap Smith made his Aberdeen debut in 2012 and has scored four times in 89 appearances for the Pittodrie side.
"It's a brilliant acquisition for us," boss Jack Ross told St Mirren's official website.
"Cammy is a really good player and someone I didn't think we'd be able to get because he was at Dundee United.
"He's a good, mature boy and I think he'll be a good fit and gives us another option in the attacking area."
Championship bottom side St Mirren host Falkirk on Saturday.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "st mirren have signed aberdeen striker cammy smith on loan",
  "until january",
  "striker",
  "st mirren"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "st mirren have signed aberdeen striker cammy smith on loan" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article states that Cammy Smith was loaned to St Mirren by Aberdeen, not signed by St Mirren.
2. "until january" - This statement is not consistent with the article because the article does not mention the duration of Cammy Smith's loan.
3. "striker" - This statement is consistent with the article, as Cammy Smith is a striker.
4. "st mirren" - This statement is consistent with the article, as the article refers to St Mirren as the team that loaned Cammy Smith.

Therefore, the summary has consistency issues with the following spans:

* "st mirren have signed aberdeen striker cammy smith on loan" (should be "loaned" instead of "signed")
* "until january" (not mentioned in the article)

The rest of the summary is consistent with the article.
