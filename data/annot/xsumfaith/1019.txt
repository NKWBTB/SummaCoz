    1. The article states that "Two cars were damaged in the incident in the Nursery Drive and Parkhead area of Newry on Friday night."
    2. The summary states that "a police community support officer has said he is 'appalled' after a car was attacked in county down on New Year's day."
    3. The article does not mention any police community support officer or any car being attacked. Instead, it mentions two cars being damaged.
    4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a police community support officer and a car being attacked, while the article only mentions two cars being damaged.
    5. The summary is likely incorrect or incomplete because it does not accurately reflect the information in the article.
