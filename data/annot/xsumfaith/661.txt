    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Kieran Lee could feature after three months out.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Kieran Lee.
3. Instead, the article mentions that forward Fernando Forestieri is a doubt, midfielder Jacob Butterfield is hoping for a recall, and striker David Nugent could return after missing Monday's draw with Huddersfield.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a player (Kieran Lee) who is not mentioned in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it includes information about a player (Kieran Lee) who does not appear in the article.
