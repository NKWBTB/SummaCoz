</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions three players who could potentially return from injury:
	* Forward Fernando Forestieri (knee) is a doubt.
	* Striker David Nugent (groin) could return.
	* Midfielder Jacob Butterfield is hoping for a recall.
2. The summary mentions a different player, Kieran Lee, who is not mentioned in the article:
	* Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Kieran Lee (hip) could feature after three months out.
3. The article does not mention Kieran Lee or any injury he may have sustained. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a player (Kieran Lee) who is not mentioned in the article, and it also implies that he has been out for three months, which is not supported by the article.
