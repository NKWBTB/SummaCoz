Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Forward Fernando Forestieri (knee) is a doubt having only been able to play from the bench in the last two games." This means that Forestieri is not fully fit and may not start the game.
2. The article also states that "Midfielder Jacob Butterfield is hoping for a recall after coming off the bench to score a late leveller against the Terriers." This means that Butterfield is available for selection and may start the game.
3. However, the summary states that "Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Kieran Lee (hip) could feature after three months out." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Kieran Lee in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it includes information about a player (Kieran Lee) who is not mentioned in the article.
