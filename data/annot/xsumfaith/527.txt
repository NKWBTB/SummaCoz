Find out why.

<Article>
The daily Yeni Safak said its offices and those of Yeni Akit were attacked. No casualties were reported.
It said four masked assailants attacked the Yeni Safak building. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze.
Police have cordoned off the area around the building.
The two papers support the governing AK Party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Yeni Akit offices are 20km (12 miles) away from the Yeni Safak building, and the night-time attacks happened almost at the same time, early on Thursday.
Windows in both buildings were shattered by the gunfire, Istanbul police said.
"Numerous spent bullet casings were also found at both scenes," the police added. They are now hunting the assailants.
So far no group has claimed it was behind the attacks.
Last September, pro-government protesters attacked the offices of the daily Hurriyet, accusing the paper of misquoting President Erdogan.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the assailants were masked, but the summary does not mention this detail. The summary only mentions "unidentified assailants," which is inconsistent with the article's description of the attackers as masked.
2. The article states that the attacks happened "almost at the same time" and that the windows in both buildings were shattered by gunfire, but the summary does not mention this detail. Instead, it only says that the assailants hurled petrol bombs and fired shots, which is not consistent with the article's description of the attacks.
3. The article states that the police are hunting the assailants and that no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the summary does not mention this detail. Instead, it only says that the attackers fired shots, which implies that they were not apprehended or identified.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the details of the attacks, such as the masked nature of the assailants, the simultaneous nature of the attacks, and the ongoing investigation by the police.
