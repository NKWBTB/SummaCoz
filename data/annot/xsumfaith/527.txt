Find out why.

<Article>
The daily Yeni Safak said its offices and those of Yeni Akit were attacked. No casualties were reported.
It said four masked assailants attacked the Yeni Safak building. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze.
Police have cordoned off the area around the building.
The two papers support the governing AK Party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Yeni Akit offices are 20km (12 miles) away from the Yeni Safak building, and the night-time attacks happened almost at the same time, early on Thursday.
Windows in both buildings were shattered by the gunfire, Istanbul police said.
"Numerous spent bullet casings were also found at both scenes," the police added. They are now hunting the assailants.
So far no group has claimed it was behind the attacks.
Last September, pro-government protesters attacked the offices of the daily Hurriyet, accusing the paper of misquoting President Erdogan.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "two staunchly pro-government turkish newspapers, the papers":
The article states that Yeni Safak and Yeni Akit are pro-government papers, but the summary incorrectly says "staunchly pro-government". The word "staunchly" implies a stronger level of support than what is actually stated in the article.
2. "hurled petrol bombs and fired shots":
The article states that the attackers fired shots, but it does not mention petrol bombs. The summary is inconsistent with the article by including petrol bombs.
3. "staunchly pro-government":
The article does not use the phrase "staunchly pro-government" to describe Yeni Safak and Yeni Akit. The summary is adding an adjective that is not present in the article.
4. "hurled petrol bombs":
As mentioned earlier, the article does not mention petrol bombs. The summary is inconsistent with the article by including this detail.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, and it uses language that is not accurate.
