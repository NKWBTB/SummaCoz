Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header.
Bradford dominated the rest of the opening period as the visitors' defence survived a series of narrow escapes.
Keeper Connor Ripley made a brilliant one-handed save to deny winger Mark Marshall, Timothee Dieng and Josh Cullen both had shots deflected for corners, and Billy Clarke missed a good chance when he turned James Meredith's cross wide.
Oldham somehow held their lead until half-time, but Bradford deservedly equalised after 57 minutes when Ousmane Fane dragged Cullen to the ground and Clarke scored from the spot.
Bradford continued to dominate, but could not turn possession into goals as Oldham's defence held firm.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "league one leaders bradford city were held to a goalless draw by league one relegation rivals bradford"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Bradford City drew with Oldham Athletic 1-1.
2. The summary states that Bradford City were held to a goalless draw by Oldham Athletic.
3. The word "goalless" implies that neither team scored, which is not consistent with the article's report of Bradford City scoring one goal and Oldham Athletic scoring one goal.
4. Therefore, the phrase "goalless draw" in the summary is not accurate and inconsistent with the information in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, specifically the score of the match.
