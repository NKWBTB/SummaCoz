    Summary: 
    league one leaders bradford city were held to a goalless draw by league one relegation rivals bradford. 

    Article: 
    Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header.
Bradford dominated the rest of the opening period as the visitors' defence survived a series of narrow escapes.
Keeper Connor Ripley made a brilliant one-handed save to deny winger Mark Marshall, Timothee Dieng and Josh Cullen both had shots deflected for corners, and Billy Clarke missed a good chance when he turned James Meredith's cross wide.
Oldham somehow held their lead until half-time, but Bradford deservedly equalised after 57 minutes when Ousmane Fane dragged Cullen to the ground and Clarke scored from the spot.
Bradford continued to dominate, but could not turn possession into goals as Oldham's defence held firm.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify why the given summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps to explain why:

Step 1: Identify the main points of the summary
The summary states that Bradford City were held to a goalless draw by league one relegation rivals Bradford.

Step 2: Identify the main points of the article
The article states that Oldham Athletic went in front in the fifth minute through a Marc Klok free-kick, and that Bradford dominated the rest of the opening period but could not score. Oldham held their lead until half-time, but Bradford equalized in the 57th minute through a penalty after Ousmane Fane was fouled by Billy Clarke. The rest of the match was evenly contested, but neither team could score.

Step 3: Identify inconsistencies
The summary does not mention any of the key events described in the article, such as Oldham's goal or Bradford's equalizer. Instead, it simply states that Bradford were held to a goalless draw by Bradford, which is not consistent with the article's account of the match.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistencies
The inconsistency between the summary and the article can be explained by the fact that the summary does not provide a detailed account of the match, but rather a general overview of the result. The summary does not mention any specific events or details from the match, whereas the article provides a more detailed account of the game, including the goals and key moments.

Therefore, the given summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide a detailed account of the match and instead only provides a general overview of the result.
