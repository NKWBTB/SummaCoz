    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    police are investigating a suspicious fire at a house in county antrim. 

    Article: 
    The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the police are investigating a suspicious fire at a house in County Antrim.
2. However, the article states that the fire is not thought to be suspicious and there are no suspicious circumstances.
3. This contradiction indicates that the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The article states that the fire caused extensive structural damage and it will take some time for structural engineers to advise when it will be safe to enter the property.
5. Therefore, it is likely that the police are not yet able to investigate the fire thoroughly, and the statement in the summary that the police are investigating the fire is not accurate.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the police are investigating a suspicious fire, while the article states that the fire is not thought to be suspicious and there are no suspicious circumstances. Additionally, the article highlights that the extensive damage caused by the fire has prevented the police from entering the property, which further supports the conclusion that the summary is not consistent with the article.
