Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Carlos Tevez has signed for Shanghai Shenhua, but the article does not mention anything about Shanghai Shenhua. Instead, the article states that Tevez has signed for Shanghai SIPG.
2. The summary mentions that Tevez is an ex-Manchester City and United striker, which is correct. However, the article does not provide any information about Tevez's past clubs.
3. The summary states that the deal is worth £40m, but the article does not mention any specific figure. Instead, it mentions that the deal is "estimated to cost £60m".
4. The summary mentions that Tevez will earn a salary in excess of £310,000 a week, but the article does not provide any information about his salary.
5. Finally, the summary does not mention anything about Chelsea agreeing terms with Shanghai SIPG for Brazil midfielder Oscar, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important information.
