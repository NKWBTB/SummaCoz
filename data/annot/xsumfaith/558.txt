     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Carlos Tevez has signed for Shanghai Shenhua, but the article does not mention anything about Tevez signing for the club. Instead, the article states that Shanghai have signed the Argentina forward from Boca Juniors, but no details were given over the contract.
2. The summary mentions a salary of £310,000 a week for Tevez, but the article does not provide any information about his salary.
3. The summary states that Tevez played for seven years in the Premier League and won the title with both Manchester clubs, but the article does not mention anything about his time in the Premier League or his titles won.
4. The summary mentions that Tevez lifted the Champions League trophy with United in 2008, but the article does not mention anything about the Champions League or Tevez's time at United.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as Tevez signing for Shanghai Shenhua and his salary, as well as incorrect information, such as his time in the Premier League and titles won.
