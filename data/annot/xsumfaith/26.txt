<Article>
David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that David Lipton, the IMF's second in command, warned of a delicate juncture for the global economy and mentioned that the IMF is likely to downgrade its forecast for global growth in April.
2. The article also mentions that China's exports have plunged by a quarter from a year ago, which is a negative indicator for global growth.
3. However, the summary states that the IMF has warned of falling global growth, which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about falling global growth, but rather a delicate juncture and a likely downgrade of the forecast.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the situation by stating that the IMF has warned of falling global growth, which is not supported by the text.
