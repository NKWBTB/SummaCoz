<Article>
David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that David Lipton, the IMF's second in command, outlined some risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics.
2. The article does not mention the IMF issuing any warnings. Instead, it quotes Lipton as saying that the IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows a weakening baseline and that they are at a delicate juncture.
3. The summary states that the IMF has warned of falling global growth. This is not supported by the article, which does not mention any warnings from the IMF.
4. The word "warned" in the summary is not supported by the article, as the article does not mention any warnings from the IMF.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the word "warned" should be removed or rephrased to better reflect the content of the article.
