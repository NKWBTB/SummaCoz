<s>[INST] Note that consistency means all information in the summary is supported by the article. 
    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    the international monetary fund ( imf ) has warned that the global economy may be at risk of falling global growth. 

    Article: 
    David Lipton, second in command at the IMF, outlined some of these risks in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics in Washington on Tuesday.
"The IMF's latest reading of the global economy shows once again a weakening baseline," he said. "We are clearly at a delicate juncture."
The comments come after weaker-than-expected trade figures from China showing that exports plunged by a quarter from a year ago.
The IMF has already said it is likely it will downgrade its current forecast of 3.4% for global growth when it next releases its economic predictions in April.
The dismal picture is one that has on-going ramifications for businesses and industries that bet on China's growth story.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the IMF has warned of a risk of falling global growth.
2. However, the article does not mention any warning from the IMF about falling global growth. Instead, it quotes David Lipton, the IMF's second in command, as saying that the global economy is at a delicate juncture and that the IMF is likely to downgrade its forecast for global growth in April.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies a more urgent and dire warning from the IMF about global growth, while the article only mentions a downgrade to the forecast and does not use language like "risk of falling global growth."
4. The article does mention weaker-than-expected trade figures from China, but this is not the same as a warning about falling global growth.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the language used by the IMF and implies a more dire situation than the article actually describes.
