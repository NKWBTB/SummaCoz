<Article>
Vincent Barker, known as Vinnie, died in July 2012, five months after he had a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich.
The prosecution told Ipswich Crown Court the conduct of eye specialist Honey Rose, 35, was so far below the expected standard it was "criminal".
Ms Rose denies a charge of gross negligence manslaughter.

Jonathan Rees QC said the alleged failure of Ms Rose, of Newham, east London, to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test, and refer him on for further investigation, was "at the heart of the prosecution case".
A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death, the court heard.
"The prosecution allege that Vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant, Ms Rose, done her job properly," he told the jury.
"Given the risk of death involved, her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent optometrist - that it was criminal."
The trial continues.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article is about the gross negligence manslaughter trial of eye specialist Honey Rose, who is accused of causing the death of Vincent Barker due to her alleged failure to detect his swollen optic discs during a routine eye test.
2. The summary, however, mentions nothing about the death of Vincent Barker or any alleged failure of Honey Rose to detect his condition. Instead, it mentions that a man accused of murdering Vincent Barker 30 years ago has told a jury that his death was "preventable" and "preventable".
3. This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of anyone being accused of murdering Vincent Barker 30 years ago. Additionally, the article focuses on the alleged negligence of Honey Rose, not on any potential murder investigation.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a mistake or a misleading summary of the actual content of the article.
