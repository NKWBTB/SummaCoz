    Summary: 
    star wars actor john fett says he is " overwhelmed " by the latest collection of star wars: the force awakens. 

    Article: 
    The 39-year-old, who goes by the name Mick Fett, was born the year the first film in the series came out.
Since the 1990s, Fett has amassed a vast collection of action figures, costumes and other merchandise.
His collection fills the five-bedroom home he shares with his girlfriend and is estimated to be worth A$500,000 (Â£300,000; $370,000).
"I mentioned that I had some Star Wars stuff when we first got together," he told the BBC. "She was a bit overwhelmed at first and then she sort of adapted."
The suburban house is filled with a life-size Han Solo carbonite statue, priceless vintage toys and a vast collection of creatures from across the galaxy.
There's an entire room dedicated to arcade games and even a pod-racer in the backyard. Only one room does not have Star Wars memorabilia in it - the main bathroom.

"When I'm not dressing up in Star Wars costumes, I wear a uniform," he said.
"It's two different worlds. The guys at work can't believe what I do in my Star Wars time and all my Star Wars friends can't believe I'm a police officer."
The idea to redecorate the Darth Vader costume began when he attended an overseas Star Wars convention.
He originally intended to attend the event as a Stormtrooper with an Australian flag cape. But at the suggestion the idea evolved.
"One of my mates said: 'Why don't you go out and spray paint the entire costume?' I thought - instead of doing a Stormtrooper why not Vader?"
The Down Under alter ego of the Sith Lord has since become a huge hit - at home and abroad.
"I don't know whether Aussie Vader is a villain or a Rebel," he laughed. "I'm a bit of a Rogue One myself."
"One of my favourite sayings is 'May the Force be with you, mate,'" he said.
"The cape is an Australian flag. I've got beer cans on my belt and blue flames airbrushed onto my helmet and chest piece. I've even made a custom light-sabre with a didgeridoo handle."
He has already seen the new Star Wars film Rogue One, once at the red carpet premiere and again at a midnight screening with fans.
"It definitely beat all my expectations," he said, adding that the latest blockbuster is a great tribute to the original trilogy.
"Empire Strikes Back was dark and gritty. Rogue One has a lot of those elements too."

     Sure, here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Mick Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection, but the article does not mention anything about him being overwhelmed. Instead, the article portrays him as a passionate Star Wars fan who has spent years collecting merchandise and has a vast collection worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
3. The summary mentions that Mick Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that. The only quote from Mick Fett in the article is "I mentioned that I had some Star Wars stuff when we first got together," which does not convey the same sentiment as the summary.
4. The summary mentions that the article is about Mick Fett's Star Wars collection, but the article is actually about Mick Fett's unique and extensive collection of Star Wars memorabilia and his love for the franchise. The article does not focus solely on his collection, but also includes details about his personal life and his passion for the franchise.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate representation of the article. It exaggerates Mick Fett's reaction to the latest Star Wars collection and focuses solely on his collection, while the article provides a more balanced view of Mick Fett's passion for Star Wars and his unique collection.
