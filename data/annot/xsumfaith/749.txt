    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    an unannounced inspection of an under-pressure a&e unit at a north wales hospital led to concerns for patient safety, a watchdog says. 

    Article: 
    Health Inspectorate Wales said Wrexham Maelor Hospital staff were under "considerable pressure" for long periods as ambulances waited outside.
It said inspectors were told the situation was not unusual.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was working to manage the pressures.
Inspectors visited the A&E unit and another ward on 30 September and 1 October last year and have released reports about what they found.
Despite the pressures in A&E they said staff were observed to be effectively prioritising clinical need and patient care.
On the Mason Ward, inspectors found patients to be well looked after and said staff were committed to providing good standards of care.
Angela Hopkins, executive director of nursing and midwifery at the health board, said its hospitals were experiencing growing demand like the rest of the UK.
"We are focussing on the improvement of emergency department and ward processes for both admission and discharge to reduce delays," she said.
"We are increasing the numbers of nursing staff and extra beds have been opened.
"We are also working in partnership with local authorities and the Welsh Ambulance Service to ensure that the system works more smoothly to improve patient flow through the hospital." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the inspection found concerns for patient safety, but the article does not mention any specific concerns or issues with patient safety.
2. The summary mentions that the inspection was unannounced, but the article does not mention this detail.
3. The summary states that the inspectors found patients to be well looked after and staff to be committed to providing good standards of care, but the article does not mention this.
4. The article focuses on the pressures faced by the hospital and the health board's efforts to manage those pressures, but the summary does not mention this context.

Therefore, based on these differences, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary presents a more negative view of the hospital's patient safety, while the article presents a more neutral view of the hospital's performance, focusing on the challenges faced by the hospital and the health board's efforts to address them.
