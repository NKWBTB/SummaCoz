UK and the EU: Travel and living abroad
Sit on the sea wall by their cafÃ© and you'll struggle to hear much Spanish conversation. Almost everyone walking by is either a British tourist or resident.
There are 309,000 Brits registered as having residency in Spain but there are likely to be many thousands more living here for just part of the year.
Sat at one of the cafÃ©'s tables is Scotsman Mark Connor. A singer and radio DJ, he performs at a nearby Irish bar.
He has been paying close attention to the referendum debate and is annoyed by some of the arguments being put forward by the Remain side.
In particular he is irritated at the suggestion that if Britain leaves, the Spanish government could make it harder to live and work here.
The Spanish wouldn't dare make it harder for Brits he says because they contribute so much to the economy.
'"The pensioners have their own UK pensions so they're not a drain on the state," Mark tells me.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the UK voted to leave the European Union, but the article does not support this statement. The article discusses the perspectives of British expats living in Spain and does not mention the outcome of the EU referendum.
2. The summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU, while the article focuses on the experiences of individual expats in Spain.
3. The article does not mention any information about the EU referendum outcome or the reasons why the UK might have voted to leave the EU. Instead, it discusses the perspectives of British expats living in Spain and their concerns about their financial and healthcare status in the event of a Brexit.
4. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate reflection of the content of the article. It is a misleading summary that does not accurately represent the information presented in the article.
