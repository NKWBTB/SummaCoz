<Article>
The charge follows the mass fracas in the 95th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium, which Chelsea won 3-1.
City had forward Sergio Aguero and midfielder Fernandinho sent off, but Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will not face any further action.
City manager Pep Guardiola apologised for his team's part in the incident.
Aguero, 28, received a four-match ban for what was his second dismissal for violent conduct this season, following a high and late challenge on Chelsea defender David Luiz.
Fernandinho clashed with Fabregas in the scuffle that followed Aguero's challenge, and the Brazil midfielder will serve a three-match ban.
Both clubs have until 18:00 GMT on 8 December to respond to the charge.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Manchester City has been charged by the Football Association for violent conduct during Saturday's Premier League game at Etihad Stadium.
2. However, the summary states that both Manchester City and Chelsea have been charged for violent conduct.
3. The article clearly states that only Manchester City has been charged, and there is no mention of Chelsea being charged.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it incorrectly includes Chelsea as one of the clubs charged.
5. The reason for this inconsistency is likely a mistake or an error in the summary, as there is no mention of Chelsea being involved in the violent conduct or being charged by the Football Association in the article.
