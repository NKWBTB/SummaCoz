    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a 60-year-old woman in dumfries and galloway has been conned out of # 30,000 just a week after a similar scam netted # 10,000. 

    Article: 
    The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT.
Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet.
He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash.
The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later.
PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.
"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.
"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.
"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that a 60-year-old woman in Dumfries and Galloway was conned out of £30,000, but the article does not mention any such incident.
2. The article only mentions two incidents: one in Sandyhills where a 71-year-old woman lost £10,000 and another in Stranraer where a woman lost money to a caller claiming to be from BT technical support.
3. The article does not mention any third incident involving a 60-year-old woman in Dumfries and Galloway.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a false or misleading statement.

Overall, the summary is not supported by the information in the article, and it is likely that it is a fabricated or misleading statement.
