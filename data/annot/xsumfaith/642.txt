Find out why.

<Article>
The first incident saw a 71-year-old woman from Sandyhills tricked by someone claiming to work for BT.
Now a woman in Stranraer has lost money to a caller who said he was contacting her about problems with her internet.
He claimed to be from BT technical support and gained remote access to her computer to take the cash.
The Sandyhills incident happened on 15 September with the Stranraer con taking place seven days later.
PC Siobhan Pellett said: "The ease with which these people seem to be able to gain access to their victim's computer is frightening and the sums of money being taken are substantial.
"We are asking people to be very, very careful when answering a cold call from someone who tries to gain remote access to their computer in order to rectify an alleged fault.
"Our message is worth repeating once again that people should never, never give out any banking details or account numbers over the telephone.
"Banks, building societies and reputable businesses never ask for this information."

]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the first incident happened on September 15, and the second incident happened seven days later, which is September 22.
2. The summary states that the scam netted £10,000, but the article does not mention this amount. Instead, it mentions that the victim lost money to a caller who claimed to be from BT technical support.
3. The summary also states that the victim is a 60-year-old woman in Dumfries and Galloway, but the article does not mention the age or location of the victim.
4. The summary states that the scam netted £30,000, but there is no mention of this amount in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article, such as the amount of money lost and the age and location of the victim. Additionally, the article does not mention a second incident or a scam that netted £30,000.
