<Article>
The call was made at a scrutiny meeting of the council to discuss the problems surrounding the new vessel.
Council leader Dave Stewart said the crossing at Cowes would be free until 2 July "in recognition of the problems" and to allow feedback.
Mr Stewart said the council had ordered a review of the project by auditors.
He said it had been a "frustrating and disappointing start" to the ferry.
Since launching late on 14 May the chain ferry has broken down, run aground and been suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to "training issues".
Cars have also been damaged getting on and off.
Shopkeeper Angie Booth, who owns Valu-4-U in East Cowes, said: "Whether I come out of this and survive I am not sure - other businesses too. We are bearing the brunt of the loss of almost six months of trade.
"Will you compensate local businesses, the same as for damaged cars?"
Transport councillor Ian Ward said compensation was up for discussion.
He added: "I don't think it's a disaster. It's a prototype. There are bound to be teething problems. There were electrical problems which the company has rectified."
He said the council authorised the manufacture of ramp extensions to resolve the problem of vehicles scraping the concrete.
He said groundings were an issue with seamanship, which had been resolved.

[
  "isle of wight\\'s",
  "floating bridge"

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "isle of wight's" - The article never uses the possessive form "isle of wight's" to refer to the Isle of Wight. Instead, it uses "the Isle of Wight" or "Isle of Wight" without the possessive apostrophe. Therefore, the summary should not have used "isle of wight's" in this context.
2. "floating bridge" - The article never uses the term "floating bridge" to describe the new vessel. Instead, it uses "chain ferry" or "the crossing" to refer to the new link between East Cowes and Cowes. Therefore, the summary should not have used "floating bridge" in this context.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it uses possessive forms and terms that are not present in the article. To make the summary consistent with the article, the following changes could be made:

1. Replace "isle of wight's" with "the Isle of Wight" or "Isle of Wight".
2. Replace "floating bridge" with "chain ferry" or "the crossing".

Here's the revised summary:

shopkeepers near the Isle of Wight have asked councillors to consider compensating them for loss of business due to the problems with the new chain ferry.
