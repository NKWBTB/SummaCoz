    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the man was taken to hospital after a two-vehicle crash on the A96 in County Antrim.
2. The article states that the incident happened near Dr Gray's Hospital, but it does not mention a two-vehicle crash. Instead, it states that the man was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.
3. The article also states that the A96 was closed in the area for several hours, but it has since reopened.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a two-vehicle crash, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the article does not mention the A96 being closed, whereas the summary states that it was closed for several hours.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
