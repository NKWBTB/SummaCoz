</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the incident happened near Dr Gray's Hospital, which is located in County Antrim.
2. The summary states that the incident occurred on the A96, but it does not mention the location of the hospital.
3. The article states that the man was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries, but the summary does not mention anything about the man's injuries.
4. The article states that the A96 was closed in the area for several hours, but the summary does not mention anything about the road being closed.

Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide enough information about the incident to accurately summarize the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that a man has been taken to hospital after a two-vehicle crash on the A96 in county Antrim.
2. However, the article does not mention a two-vehicle crash nor the crash happened in county Antrim.
