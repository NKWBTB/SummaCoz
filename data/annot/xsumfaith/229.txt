The limb was found in a garden in Cranwells Park on Wednesday and has been sent for forensic analysis, Avon and Somerset Police said.
A force spokesman said detectives were "keeping an open mind" as to whether it was linked to two similar incidents in the city.
All three feet have been found within a few hundred yards of each other.
Tests showed the first foot found in Weston Park East in February was  "probably" a medical teaching aid. The second foot, found last month in the same area, is still undergoing tests.
"The same officers are looking into the latest discoveries and will look to confirm beyond all reasonable doubt that they are linked and if there are any new lines of inquiry which can be taken forward," the spokesman added.

</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "bristol",
  "human"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "bristol" - The article does not mention the location of the discovery, only that it was found in a garden in Cranwells Park. Therefore, the summary's reference to "bristol" is not supported by the article.
2. "human" - The article does not explicitly state that the discovered limb is human. While it does mention that the limb was found in a garden, it could potentially be a non-human object or a body part from an animal. Therefore, the summary's reference to "human" is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary contains two inconsistencies with the article: the location of the discovery (Bristol vs. Cranwells Park) and the type of object discovered (human vs. non-human).
