Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Richard Ellis, Ciaran Monaghan, and Ewan Sutherland are leaving the council, but the summary only mentions "two senior councillors" leaving. This is inconsistent because the article mentions three people leaving, but the summary only mentions two.
2. The article does not use the term "councillors" to describe any of the individuals leaving. The summary introduces the departure with the phrase "two senior councillors at aberdeenshire council," which is not supported by the article.
3. The article does not mention anything about the departures being voluntary or due to early retirement. The summary mentions "voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme," but this is not supported by the article.
4. The article does not mention the leader of the opposition SNP group or any expected further departures in the coming months. The summary mentions these details, but they are not present in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions two people leaving, when the article mentions three, and it introduces the departure with a phrase that is not supported by the article. Additionally, the summary includes details that are not present in the article, such as the reason for the departures and the leader of the opposition SNP group's comments.
