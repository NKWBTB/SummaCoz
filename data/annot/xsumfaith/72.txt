    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    two senior councillors at aberdeenshire council are to leave the authority. 

    Article: 
    The local authority said Richard Ellis was leaving on Friday at the end of his contract.
Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland are both going under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.
Stephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, said the departures were indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff.
He said he expected further departures in the coming months.
Mr Ellis is the council's former interim director of corporate governance, and has also been acting as deputy chief executive for several months.
Mr Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, while Mr Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.
Council chief executive Angela Scott thanked the trio for their "dedication and professionalism". 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that two senior councillors at Aberdeenshire Council are leaving the authority, but the article does not mention any councillors leaving. The article only mentions three senior staff members leaving: Richard Ellis, Ciaran Monaghan, and Ewan Sutherland.
2. The summary mentions that the departures are under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that the three staff members are leaving at the end of their contracts.
3. The summary quotes Stephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, as saying that the departures are indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff. However, the article does not include this quote.
4. The summary mentions that Mr. Ellis is the council's former interim director of corporate governance and has been acting as deputy chief executive for several months, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article only mentions three senior staff members leaving at the end of their contracts, without mentioning any councillors leaving or any voluntary redundancy or early retirement scheme. Additionally, the article does not include the quote from Stephen Flynn.
