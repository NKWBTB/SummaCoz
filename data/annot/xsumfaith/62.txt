</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "several other people received minor injuries" in the crash, which suggests that there were multiple people involved in the incident.
2. The summary only mentions one person dying, which is not consistent with the article's information.
3. The article does not mention any fatalities, only that "inquiries into the incident were ongoing."
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that one person has died, while the article does not mention any fatalities.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that one person has died, when in fact, the article does not mention any fatalities.
