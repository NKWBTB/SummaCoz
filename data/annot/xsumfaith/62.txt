</Summary>

For your information, it's reported that the following spans in the summary have consistency issues:
[
  "highlands",
  "one person has died following a two-vehicle"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "highlands" - The article does not mention the "highlands" at all. The incident occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness, which is not in the Highlands. Therefore, this statement in the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. "one person has died following a two-vehicle" - The article states that "several other people received minor injuries" in the crash, but it does not mention that one person has died. This statement in the summary is also not consistent with the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains two statements that are not accurate based on the information provided in the article.
