</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the council is using Jetpatcher machines to fill in potholes, which implies that the potholes are already present and need to be filled.
2. The summary, on the other hand, states that repairs have been carried out to a major drainage system, which implies that the system was damaged and needed to be repaired.
3. There is no mention of any drainage system damage in the article.
4. The article only mentions that extra staff will be out repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain and clearing debris from gutters, but there is no mention of any major drainage system damage.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a major drainage system damage, which is not supported by the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions that repairs have been carried out to a major drainage system damaged in what is believed to be the first of its kind in the uk.
2. The article only mentions that extra staff will also be out repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain and to clear debris from gutters.
3. The article does not mention anything about "what is believed to be the first of its kind in the uk".
