    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    repairs have been carried out to a major drainage system damaged in what is believed to be the first of its kind in the uk. 

    Article: 
    Northumberland County Council said the weather was now warm enough for its Jetpatcher machines to tackle the holes.
It is hoped that 145 potholes each day will be "filled in" over the next four months, the council said.
Extra staff will also be out repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain and to clear debris from gutters. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that repairs have been carried out to a major drainage system damaged in what is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK.
2. However, the article does not mention any repairs being carried out to a major drainage system. Instead, it talks about the council using Jetpatcher machines to fill in potholes and clear debris from gutters.
3. The word "drainage system" is not mentioned in the article at all.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions repairs being carried out to a drainage system, which is not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not accurate because it includes information that is not present in the article.
