</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jordan Tansey has returned to Wakefield, indicating that he was previously with the club and has now returned.
2. The summary states that Jordan Tansey has signed a new two-year contract with the league two side, which suggests that he was not already contracted to the club.
3. The article does not mention anything about Jordan Tansey signing a new contract, only that he has returned to the club.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Jordan Tansey has signed a new contract, while the article states that he has simply returned to the club.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it contains information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the summary states that Jordan Tansey has signed a new two-year contract, which is not mentioned in the article.
