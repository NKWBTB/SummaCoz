    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Jordan Tansey has signed a new two-year contract with the league two side, keeping him at the club until June 2019.

This is not consistent with the article because the article states that Tansey has returned to Wakefield, but it does not mention a new two-year contract. Instead, it mentions that he could make his debut for Super League's bottom side in Friday's trip to Hull FC.

2. The article states that Tansey has scored 24 tries in 37 appearances for the Wolves.

This information is not mentioned in the summary.

3. The summary states that the opportunity for another outside back to come into the squad was there, as quoted by managing director Richard Thewlis.

This is not mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
