<Article>
The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday.
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the robbery occurred in Glasgow, but the article does not mention the location of the robbery. The article only mentions the location of the Post Office as Quarrywood Avenue in the Barmulloch area.
2. The summary states that two men were threatened with a knife, but the article does not mention the use of a knife. The article only mentions that one of the suspects was described as having a knife.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the worker was badly shaken but otherwise unharmed.
4. The summary does not mention the appeal for information from the police.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it omits several key details and includes some inaccuracies.
