Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.

"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that two men were threatened with a knife during a robbery at a post office in Glasgow, but the article does not mention anything about the suspects using a knife.

2. The summary states that the suspects demanded money before escaping with the cash, but the article does not mention anything about the suspects escaping with the cash.

3. The summary does not mention the fact that the 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.

4. The summary does not mention the description of the suspects as white, one of them being about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.

5. The summary does not mention the door-to-door inquiries and the collection of CCTV images from the surrounding area that the police were doing.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits several important details and includes some inaccuracies.
