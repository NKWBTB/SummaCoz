Find out why.

<Article>
The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday.
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."

[
  "glasgow",
  "two men",
  "two"
]

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
 Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. "glasgow": The article states that the Post Office is located in Quarrywood Avenue in the Barmulloch area, but it does not mention Glasgow. Therefore, the summary's reference to Glasgow is inconsistent with the article.
2. "two men": The article states that "two suspects" entered the Post Office, but the summary only mentions "two men". This is a minor inconsistency, but it could be confusing for readers who are looking for information about the suspects.
3. "two": The article states that "two suspects" entered the Post Office, but the summary says "two men". This is a repetition of the inconsistency mentioned above.

Overall, the summary has consistency issues because it does not accurately reflect the information in the article. The article provides more specific details about the suspects and the location of the Post Office, while the summary is more general and does not provide any specific details.
