    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    a fire at a house in dunmurry, county antrim, is to be carried out, police have said. 

    Article: 
    The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property." 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the police have said that a fire at a house in Dunmurry, County Antrim is to be carried out.

This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of the police saying that the fire is to be carried out. Instead, the article states that the emergency services were called to the property and that the fire is not thought to be suspicious.

2. The summary also states that the fire was at a house in Dunmurry, County Antrim.

This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that the fire was in the Sangomore area of Durness, not Dunmurry.

3. The summary does not mention that the relatives of the owner of the property have been informed, as stated in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed and accurate information about the fire and the investigation that is underway.
