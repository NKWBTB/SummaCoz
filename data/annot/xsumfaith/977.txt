<Article>
The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00.
Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed.
Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
"Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time.
"Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property."

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article is about a fire at a property in Durness, Scotland, while the summary states that the fire is in Dunmurry, County Antrim, which is in Northern Ireland.
2. The article mentions that the fire is not thought to be suspicious, but the summary does not provide any information about the cause of the fire.
3. The article states that the damage caused by the fire has prevented entry to the property, while the summary does not mention anything about the property being inaccessible.
4. The article mentions that structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property, while the summary does not provide any information about the safety of the property.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides incorrect information about the location of the fire and does not include important details about the cause of the fire and the safety of the property.
