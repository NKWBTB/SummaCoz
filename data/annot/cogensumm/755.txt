Tottenham's fans may have been sick of the sight of Chelsea blue after their Capital One Cup final defeat, but their captain didn't appear to be. Spurs lost 2-0 to Jose Mourinho's men at Wembley Stadium, but as Hugo Lloris led his team up to collect their loser's medals, he appeared to don a Chelsea scarf. In fairness to the French goalkeeper, he didn't appear to notice it wasn't his team's colours - time playing for Les Bleus will do that to you. As Hugo Lloris goes up to collect his medal, he sees that something has been thrown at him . Without realising that it is a Chelsea scarf, the Tottenham captain picks it up and wraps it round his neck . Lloris wearing the scarf after defeat by Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley . As a clearly distracted Lloris walked up to get the medal, a member of the crowd threw the scarf at him. The former Lyon man then nonchalantly picked it up and chucked it around his neck before trudging onward. It was an unfortunate end to an unfortunate day for Lloris in which he conceded twice after opposition shots took wicked deflections off of his own players.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Tottenham's fans may have been sick of the sight of Chelsea blue, indicating that Tottenham lost to Chelsea in the FA Cup final.
2. However, the article states that Tottenham lost to Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final, not the FA Cup final.
3. The summary also states that Lloris wore a Chelsea scarf after the defeat, but the article does not mention anything about Lloris wearing a Chelsea scarf.
4. The summary incorrectly states that Tottenham lost to Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and incorrectly mentions Lloris wearing a Chelsea scarf.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains errors.
