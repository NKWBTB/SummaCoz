    Summary: 
    phelps' punishment was due to run out in early hours. 

    Article: 
    Michael Phelps could be allowed to compete at this year's world swimming championships. USA Swimming banned the 18-time Olympic champion for six months following a second drink-driving offence in Baltimore last September. That is due to run out in early April but Phelps' punishment also resulted in him being excluded from the US team for the world championships in Kazan. Now Phelps is potentially in line for a reprieve, with USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus telling ESPN.com: 'It's complicated, but there are ways in which it could happen. There's a pathway for things to be reconsidered - or considered.' Michael Phelps will be able to compete for USA when his ban runs out in early April . Phelps is an 18-time Olympic champion and could be back in action sooner than expected . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Phelps' punishment was due to run out in early hours.
2. However, the article states that Phelps' punishment resulted in him being excluded from the US team for the world championships in Kazan.
3. This means that Phelps' punishment is not just a six-month ban, but also includes his exclusion from the US team for the world championships.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions the six-month ban and does not mention Phelps' exclusion from the US team.
5. The article provides more information about Phelps' punishment and the possibility of a reprieve, which is not mentioned in the summary.

So, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only provides partial information about Phelps' punishment and does not include all the details provided in the article.
