Lambert has spent time with Borussia Dortmund and Jurgen Klopp working towards his UEFA Pro Licence . Pep Guardiola is another manager in Germany that Lambert has been able to observe at close quarters of late . Although he enjoyed his time overseas and said his time spent there 'was a great experience', Lambert admitted he had no real plans to take up a managerial role abroad at this moment in time and follow the likes of former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes, who is head coach at Real Sociedad. When asked if he fancied managing overseas right now, the former Dortmund midfielder replied: 'Not really, I went over there - I've been back in the country for over a week or so now. 'The two clubs (Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich) there I know very well. Germany's been a big part of my life there but spending that time at Dortmund was a great experience and you learn so much, even though you're only there for that week or so to watch them....it was a great, great experience.'

'I think meeting with him (Klopp) and Pep Guardiola was a great experience, to sit with them and talk to them. Defeat by Hull saw Lambert's Villa move into the relegation zone and he was subsequently sacked . Villa have improved under new manager Tim Sherwood but are still not too far off the Premier League drop . 'With Jurgen, I knew Jurgen from the Pro Licence, but to spend nine days with him was excellent. What you see on TV is what he's like as a guy....eccentric probably. He's a top, top guy and they way you see Borussia Dortmund now is probably due to him.' Lambert, who made 44 appearances playing for Dormund from 1996-1997 and helped them win the Champions League, said: 'Even though I'd played there - that was a massive football club - when I went back and watched them it's exploded really, really quickly and Jurgen has been a catalyst of what's happened.'
