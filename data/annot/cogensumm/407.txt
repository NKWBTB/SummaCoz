     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Radio Rentals spent $90 million on expenditure, but the article states that the company made $90 million in revenue.

2. The summary mentions that $45 million of the expenditure was used for entertainment items such as flat screen TVs, smart phones, and sound systems, but the article does not mention anything about entertainment items.

3. The summary implies that Radio Rentals relies on revenue from the Australian welfare system, but the article states that the company's revenue comes from Centrelink's bill-managing service, Centrepay, which is a voluntary service that helps customers manage their welfare funds.

4. The summary mentions that the Consumer Action Law Centre has expressed concerns about the consumer leasing industry's use of the Centrepay system, but the article does not mention anything about the Consumer Action Law Centre.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that Radio Rentals spent $90 million on expenditure, but the article states that the company made $90 million in revenue. Additionally, the summary implies that the company relies on revenue from the Australian welfare system, but the article states that the company's revenue comes from Centrelink's voluntary bill-managing service.
