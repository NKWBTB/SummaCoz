    Summary: 
    the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom. 

    Article: 
    Tragic: Humberto Moura Fonseca, 23, died after attempting to drink 25 vodka shots in 60 seconds . A drinking competition went tragically wrong when a student died after downing 25 shots of vodka. Humberto Moura Fonseca, 23, had been partying at the university of Julio de Mesquita in the city of Bauru, in southwest Brazil, when organisers suggested the drinking game to see who could drink 25 shots in less than 60 seconds. His friend Rodrigo Pancetti, 23, said: 'We were all having a great time and someone came up with the idea of the drinking competition. 'I knew I'd already had too much and there was no way I was going to be able to drink five, let alone 25. But Humberto and the others were really up for it. 'On his Facebook there is a quote, a motto, from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky which says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom. I never thought that would become reality. 'But once he had finished he said he felt ill and suddenly collapsed. 'We assumed it was because he was drunk but then six others also collapsed, including the winner, so we called an ambulance.' Medical crews rushed the students to hospital but Mr Fonesca died on the way. A hospital spokesman said: 'They all had alcohol poisoning and are in a critical state, with three still in intensive care.' Now police say they are looking to charge the organisers with homicide. Ironic: A quote on Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom' Drinking competition: Medical crews rushed the students to hospital but Mr Fonesca died on the way . A police spokesman said: 'Two fourth year students at the university have been arrested for organising the event without a licence and for potentially causing the death of the student.' A spokesman for the university said: 'We very much regret the death of this young man and our condolences go out to his family and friends. 'We would like to remind students that drinking alcohol in the university is banned.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the Russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but there is no mention of this in the article.
2. The article does not mention anything about the Russian or any quotes from the Russian.
3. The summary mentions a drinking competition, but the article does not mention any such competition.
4. The article states that the student died after drinking 25 shots of vodka, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The summary mentions that the student died from alcohol poisoning, but the article does not specify the cause of death.
6. The article mentions that the organizers of the event are being charged with homicide, but the summary does not mention this.
7. The summary does not mention that the university has banned drinking alcohol on campus, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote on Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
