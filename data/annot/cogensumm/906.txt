    Article: 
    The mother of an infant found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child. Samantha Green, 23, of Woodland made her first court appearance Wednesday. Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig announced the charges against Green who was arrested Saturday in the death of her 20-day-old son Justice Rees. Samantha Green (above in court), whose 20-day-old son was found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child . The charges also include an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her. Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and Green (left) were reported missing . Green, pictured above at court, told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted. Police have said they do not believe her story . 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned. Her partner Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Her partner Frank Rees (right), who is also Justice's father, is supporting Green (left; right with Rees) Crews looked through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body, which Green said was in the water . Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villaseñor then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough, News 10 reported. Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. She was then arrested and charged with murder. After her arrest, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto said: 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child.' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Based on the given article, the summary provided is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary states that Samantha Green was arrested on Saturday, but the article states that she was reported missing on Monday and her body was found the next day.
2. The summary mentions that the boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma, but the article states that he was found in a swampy area near the Sacramento River, and it's possible that he may have died from drowning or hypothermia.
3. The summary states that Green told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but the article states that she was found wet and disheveled near the river, and passerby Ricardo Villaseñor said that she seemed disoriented and explained that she and the baby had been abducted in town.
4. The summary charges Green with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child, but the article states that she was charged with murder.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a summary of a different story or event.
