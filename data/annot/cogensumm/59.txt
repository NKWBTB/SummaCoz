Blackpool supporters beamed messages on the West Stand of Bloomfield Road before Tuesday night's game . Fans displayed the messages on Bloomfield Road ahead of their 3-0 defeat by Charlton Athletic . Blackpool are all but guaranteed to be relegated from the Championship as they sit 18 points from safety with eight games remaining, and they have not won since January 31. AFC Blackpool play in the ninth tier of the English football pyramid and their ground has a 1,500 capacity, some 16,000 less than their Championship counterparts. Yet the Seasiders have been running on empty, and fans have been staying away from Bloomfield Road. Tangerine Knights spokesperson Stephen Smith told BBC Radio Lancashire: 'It is a joint protest - it is not just to do with the football club this week. 'It's a joint venture with Leeds fans, against not only Karl Oyston being a regional representative on the Football League board, but it's against the Football League as well and the various things they have done over the past couple of years.'

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that fans displayed messages on Bloomfield Road ahead of their 3-0 win. However, the article states that Blackpool lost the game 3-0 to Charlton Athletic. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary mentions nothing about a protest or fans supporting another team, which is a key aspect of the article. The article explains that Blackpool supporters are planning to protest against the Championship club's owners, the Oyston family, by watching a non-League team instead of their own team's match.
3. The summary states that fans displayed messages on Bloomfield Road ahead of their win, but the article states that the fans displayed messages criticizing the Oystons on the West Stand on Tuesday night ahead of their defeat by Charlton Athletic.
4. The summary does not mention the reason for the protest or the fact that the fans are supporting another team, which is a significant aspect of the article.

Therefore, based on these reasons, the summary is not consistent with the article.
