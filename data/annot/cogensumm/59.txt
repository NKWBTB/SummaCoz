Blackpool supporters beamed messages on the West Stand of Bloomfield Road before Tuesday night's game . Fans displayed the messages on Bloomfield Road ahead of their 3-0 defeat by Charlton Athletic . Blackpool are all but guaranteed to be relegated from the Championship as they sit 18 points from safety with eight games remaining, and they have not won since January 31. AFC Blackpool play in the ninth tier of the English football pyramid and their ground has a 1,500 capacity, some 16,000 less than their Championship counterparts. Yet the Seasiders have been running on empty, and fans have been staying away from Bloomfield Road. Tangerine Knights spokesperson Stephen Smith told BBC Radio Lancashire: 'It is a joint protest - it is not just to do with the football club this week. 'It's a joint venture with Leeds fans, against not only Karl Oyston being a regional representative on the Football League board, but it's against the Football League as well and the various things they have done over the past couple of years.'

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that fans displayed messages on Bloomfield Road ahead of a 3-0 win.
2. However, the article states that Blackpool lost 3-0 to Charlton Athletic on Tuesday night.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there was no 3-0 win for Blackpool.
4. The summary must have been written based on incorrect information or a different event.
5. The article does mention that fans displayed messages on Bloomfield Road, but it was before the game against Charlton Athletic, not after a 3-0 win.
6. The inconsistency in the summary and the article suggests that the summary is not accurate and may have been mistaken or misleading.
