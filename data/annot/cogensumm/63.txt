    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

1. The summary states that "k can also be included in messages." This is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of the letter "k" in the article.
2. The summary mentions that "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are banned words, which is correct. However, the article states that these words are not banned, but rather they are included in the list of words that are checked by the automatic phrase checker to prevent their misuse.
3. The summary states that "terrorist" and "d**k" can also be included in messages, which is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention these words being included in the list of banned words or being acceptable for use in gift messages.
4. The summary implies that the policy of banning certain words is intended to prevent their misuse, which is consistent with the article. However, the article also mentions that some terms, including jihad, Buddha, and Allah, are accepted, which contradicts the summary's statement that only certain words are accepted.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and inconsistencies in its statements about the policy of banning certain words and the acceptability of certain terms.
