A young child wields the sign aimed at Jackman, who has expressed how grateful he is for the time he has spent in remote communities . 'This is my country': As many as a thousand people could be forced to move if the WA State Government plan goes ahead . In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations. I SUPPORT YOU'. Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said. He told his father 'I think I'm going to live out here forever' but his father said he should finish college first and evaluate his options then. The X-Men star said he was inspired by the Indigenous people's sense of community and togetherness.

What do I want to say?' he said. Jackman, who was schooled at the prestigious Knox Grammar on Sydney's leafy north shore, said he had not even learned about the Stolen Generations. Blasting the PM's remarks on the issue last week, Indigenous leader Warren Mundine said living on the land was essential for the nation's first people. 'It's about their life, it's about their very essence, it's about their very culture'.
