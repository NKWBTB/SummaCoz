    Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get managerial experience of his own before he can be considered as a possible successor to Roy Hodgson as England head coach.

Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Pearce, who was in charge of England Under-21s for six years and also took caretaker charge of the senior team following Fabio Capello's resignation, told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek: 'You only really know what it's like to manage when you're in that technical area and you're the manager. 'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both. 'You can't replicate what it's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you. 'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position. 'Gary will get that eventually, but I think he needs, like anybody, to gain the experience, maybe in club football, as a manager and after that probably in international football as well.'

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Neville has been tipped to replace Hodgson, but the article does not support this claim.

Step 2: The article actually states that Pearce does not believe Neville has the experience to replace Hodgson, and that he needs to gain experience in club or international football before being considered for the top job.

Step 3: The summary does not mention Pearce's comments about Neville needing experience, and instead suggests that Neville is being considered for the job without any qualifications.

Step 4: Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect Pearce's views on Neville's readiness for the England manager job. The article presents a more nuanced view, highlighting the need for experience and suggesting that Neville should gain experience in club football before being considered for the top job.
