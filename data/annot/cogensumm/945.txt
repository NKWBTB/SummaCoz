This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel. CCTV footage shows the 65-year-old motorist, who has not been named, slowly drifting off while he navigates a road in Oakland County, Michigan. After stirring he suddenly slams on the brakes, but it proves too late and he collides with a car in front. The driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through. In a bid to avoid further damage, the driver is seen steering the bus into the hard shoulder. A loud scraping noise can be heard as the vehicle drags a trail of debris along. A number of other vehicles are bumped and scratched as the bus goes by. After the driver manages to stop, a woman who was sat in the middle of the coach, exits out of the front door. There were apparently no other passengers on board. Caught on camera: This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel .

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that the driver suddenly slams on the brakes, but the article states that the driver slowly drifted off while driving.

The article provides more information about the driver's behavior before the collision, indicating that the driver was not paying attention and slowly drifted off while driving. The summary does not include this information and instead states that the driver suddenly slams on the brakes.

Step 2: The summary states that the driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through, but the article does not mention this.

The article does mention that the driver's side of the windscreen shatters, but it does not state that it falls through. The summary adds this detail, which is not supported by the article.

Step 3: The summary states that the driver is seen steering the bus into the hard shoulder, but the article does not mention this.

The article does mention that the driver tries to avoid further damage by steering the bus into the hard shoulder, but the summary does not include this detail.

Step 4: The summary does not mention the other vehicles that were bumped and scratched by the bus, as mentioned in the article.

The article states that a number of other vehicles were bumped and scratched as the bus went by, but the summary does not include this information.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article. It omits important details and includes some inaccuracies, such as the driver suddenly slamming on the brakes and the driver's side windscreen shattering and falling through.
