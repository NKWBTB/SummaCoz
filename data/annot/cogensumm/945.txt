     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the driver "suddenly slams on the brakes," but the article states that the driver "slowly drifted off" before suddenly colliding with another vehicle. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not accurately reflect the events described in the article.
2. The summary mentions that the driver's side of the windshield "immediately shatters and falls through," but the article states that the driver's side of the windshield "shatters and falls through" only after the driver collides with another vehicle. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may not accurately represent the sequence of events.
3. The summary states that the driver "tries to brake," but the article states that the driver "tested negative for alcohol." This inconsistency suggests that the summary may not accurately reflect the driver's state at the time of the incident.
4. The summary mentions that "no one on the bus was hurt," but the article states that two motorists were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may not accurately represent the extent of the injuries sustained during the incident.

Overall, the given summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Therefore, it is not a reliable representation of the events described in the article.
