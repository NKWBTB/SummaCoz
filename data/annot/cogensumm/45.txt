    A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed the creature's incredible tongue acrobatics. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill. To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds. Scroll down for video . A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket . The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes. This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed. Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius. Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. Lifespan: Two to five years . Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth. The tongue’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself. In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion. The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved. Previous studies didn’t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said. When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics. The Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds . The tongue’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup dragging it in .

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the chameleon's tongue is captured at 1,500 frames per second, but the article does not mention the frame rate of the video.
2. The summary mentions that the chameleon attacks a cricket with remarkable speed and skill, but the article does not mention the cricket as prey. Instead, it mentions that the chameleon's tongue is used to snare its prey.
3. The summary states that the tongue reaches around 41G, but the article does not mention the speed of the tongue. Instead, it mentions that the tongue moves with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion.
4. The summary mentions that the chameleon has a bone in the base of its tongue, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that the creatures have special tissue that effectively works as a spring, but the article does not mention this.
6. The summary mentions that the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds, but the article does not mention the exact distance the tongue shoots out.
7. The summary mentions that the tongue forms a small suction cup, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not mentioned in the article and omits other important details that are included in the article.
