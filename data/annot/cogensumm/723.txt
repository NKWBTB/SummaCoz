    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Scotland international made an £11million move from Leeds in recent weeks. However, the article does not mention anything about a player making an £11million move from Leeds.
2. The article only mentions Fulham striker Ross McCormack, who made an £11million move from Leeds in the summer, but the move has backfired with Fulham falling perilously close to the relegation places in recent weeks.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Fulham's poor form or their struggles in the division, which is a key point in the article.
4. The article mentions that Fulham are unlikely to want to lose one of their best forwards, but the summary does not acknowledge this and instead suggests that Fulham are open to loaning McCormack with a view to a permanent deal should they go up.
5. Finally, the article mentions that Fulham have an eight point cushion between themselves and Wigan, but the summary does not include this information.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the key points and details mentioned in the article.
