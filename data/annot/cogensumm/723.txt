1. The summary states that Ross McCormack made an £11million move from Leeds in recent weeks.
2. However, the article states that McCormack made an £11million move from Leeds in the summer, not in recent weeks.
3. The article was written in the present tense, indicating that the information is current and up-to-date.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides outdated information about McCormack's transfer.

The correct summary should have read: "Ross McCormack made an £11million move from Leeds in the summer."
