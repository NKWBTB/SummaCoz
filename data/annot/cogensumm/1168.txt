    Article: 
    Florida mother is looking at her current jail time as a break from parenthood. Monique Miller, 34, appeared before a judge on Tuesday after allegedly throwing her baby from her car in North Miami Beach, Florida. When the judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she seemed only happy to oblige. 'OK, I need a break anyway,' she said. Monique Miller, 34 (right), told a judge on Tuesday that she needs a break from parenting after her arrest for throwing her baby out of a car . Miller was also ordered on Tuesday to take all of her prescribed medications . Cops allegedly tried to pull Miller over Monday afternoon during a routine traffic stop,when the mother was driving with her baby on her lap. Miller at first refused, but when she eventually complied she started yelling obscenities at officers and then tossed her baby out the window. Luckily an officer was able to catch the baby safely. It's unclear how old the baby is. Miller was arrested in the incident, in which she also kicked the cop's car door, causing the door to slam into his head. The mother faces charges of child neglect, criminal mischief and battery on a law enforcement officer. As of Wednesday, she remained in jail on $7,500 bond. In addition to being ordered to stay away from her child, Miller was also told to take prescribed medications. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Miller was ordered to stay away from her child, but the article states that she was arrested for throwing her baby out of a car. This is a contradiction, as it is unlikely that a judge would order someone to stay away from their child if they have not been proven to be a danger to them.
2. The summary states that Miller said she needs a break from parenting, but the article states that she was arrested for throwing her baby out of a car, which suggests that she was not a fit parent.
3. The summary does not mention the arrest or the reason for Miller's appearance in court, while the article provides detailed information about the incident that led to her arrest.
4. The summary does not mention the baby's age, while the article states that the baby was thrown out of the car.
5. The summary does not mention the officer's name or the fact that he was able to catch the baby safely, while the article provides these details.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide the same level of detail and does not accurately convey the reason for Miller's appearance in court or the circumstances of the incident that led to her arrest.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she said. But in the article, it is a fact that judge ordered her to stay away from her child and she didn't say it. The summary incorrectly concatenate sentences together.
