    Article: 
    Draft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate threatens to reduce Iranian women to 'baby-making machines' and set their rights back by decades, Amnesty International warned on Wednesday. The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the first draft law would restrict access to contraception, while the article states that the bill would ban voluntary sterilization and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. These are two different things.
2. The summary implies that the second draft law would close many jobs to women who have children, while the article states that the law would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. This is a positive aspect of the law, not a negative one.
3. The summary mentions that the laws would "entrench discriminatory practices" and "set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades," while the article states that the laws would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet abortions and expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. These are different types of negative consequences.
4. The summary states that the laws would view women as "baby-making machines," while the article states that the laws would promote a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines. These are two different ways of phrasing the same idea.

Overall, the summary takes a negative view of the draft legislation and portrays it as a threat to women's rights, while the article provides a more balanced view of the situation. The article highlights the potential negative consequences of the laws, but also notes that they are intended to address Iran's aging population and that they have some positive aspects.
