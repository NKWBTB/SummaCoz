    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Manchester United have been to watch Paulo Dybala, but he is not high on their list. This means that they are not actively pursuing him as a transfer target.
2. The summary states that Manchester United have also been to play the Argentine, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions that they have been to watch Dybala, not that they have been to play him.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not supported by the text.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is because it includes an additional statement that is not supported by the text.
