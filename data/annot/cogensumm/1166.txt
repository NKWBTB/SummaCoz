     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Miller was ordered to stay away from her child, but the article states that Miller said she needs a break from parenting. The article does not mention any order from the judge to stay away from her child.
2. The summary mentions that Miller was ordered to take all of her prescribed medications, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that Miller was arrested for throwing her baby out of a car, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Miller tossed her baby out the window during a routine traffic stop.
4. The summary does not mention the obscenities that Miller allegedly yelled at officers or the fact that she kicked the cop's car door, causing it to slam into his head.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details and includes information that is not present in the article.
