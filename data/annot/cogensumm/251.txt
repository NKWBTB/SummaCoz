</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Nelly is the "first American artist to perform in the city's 8,000 year old history."
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Nelly being the first American artist to perform in the city. Instead, it states that he was the first American artist to perform in the city of Erbil in Iraq as part of a charity concert.
3. The article does mention that the Rwanga Foundation, the non-profit organization that organized the concert, claims that Nelly is the first American artist to perform in the city's 8,000 year old history. However, this statement is not supported by any evidence in the article and is likely an exaggeration or a misstatement.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a claim that is not supported by the article's content. Specifically, the summary states that Nelly is the first American artist to perform in the city's 8,000 year old history, but the article does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
