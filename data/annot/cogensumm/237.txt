    Summary: 
    fulham striker mccormack gets his shot away as fulham win on watford. 

    Article: 
    Derby County have revived interest in Fulham's Ross McCormack. The Championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing Jordan Rhodes from Blackburn Rovers but the Ewood Park club's reluctance to deal has prompted fresh questions about McCormack. The Scotland international made an Â£11million move from Leeds in the summer but the move has backfired with Fulham falling perilously close to the relegation places in recent weeks. Fulham striker Ross McCormack battles with Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie during their clash at Craven Cottage . Fulham striker McCormack gets his shot away as Fulham take on Watford in the Championship . McCormack has been linked with a move to promotion hopefuls Derby County as Fulham stutter in the division . McCormack, 28, has still managed 12 goals in a struggling side and Derby are keen to see if Fulham will loan him with a view to a permanent deal should they go up. Fulham's form is poor with just three wins this year and they are unlikely to want to lose one of their best forwards. They have an eight point cushion between themselves and Wigan and plan a re-structure in the summer should they survive. Second-placed Derby face promotion rivals Norwich on Saturday. Jordan Rhodes (centre) was on the subs' bench for the duration of Blackburn's FA Cup match with Liverpool . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Fulham won on Watford, but the article does not mention any information about Fulham winning against Watford.
2. The summary mentions that Ross McCormack gets his shot away, but the article does not mention any information about McCormack taking shots or playing against Watford.
3. The summary mentions that Fulham are in the relegation places, but the article does not mention Fulham's current league position.
4. The article mentions that Derby County have revived interest in signing Ross McCormack from Fulham, but the summary does not mention this.
5. The article mentions that Fulham are struggling in the league and have an eight-point cushion between themselves and Wigan, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
