</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Fulham striker Ross McCormack "gets his shot away" as Fulham win against Watford.
2. However, the article states that Fulham have been struggling in the Championship and have only won three games this year.
3. Therefore, it is unlikely that Fulham would be winning against Watford, as they are in a poor run of form.
4. The article also states that Fulham are in the relegation zone and are unlikely to want to lose one of their best forwards, Ross McCormack.
5. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Fulham win against Watford with McCormack scoring is not consistent with the information in the article.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Fulham are winning and scoring goals, when in fact the article states that they are in a poor run of form and are struggling in the Championship.
