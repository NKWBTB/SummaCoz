</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Charlie Colkett, Izzy Brown and Joshua Aina have been selected in Sean O'Driscoll's squad."
2. The summary only mentions Chelsea once, stating that "Chelsea has been named in Sean O'Driscoll's side for the European qualifiers."
3. However, the article mentions four Chelsea players in the squad (Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Charlie Colkett, Izzy Brown, and Joshua Aina), while the summary only mentions "Chelsea" once, implying that only one Chelsea player has been selected.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the number of Chelsea players selected for the squad.

Overall, the summary is too general and does not provide specific information about the players selected, whereas the article provides detailed information about the players and their positions. To make the summary consistent with the article, it should include more specific information about the players selected, such as their names and positions.
