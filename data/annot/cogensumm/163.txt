    Summary: 
    chelsea has been named in sean o'driscoll's side for the european qualifiers. 

    Article: 
    Young stars from Chelsea and Manchester City feature prominently in the England Under 19 squad selected by Sean O’Driscoll for the forthcoming round of European Championship qualifiers in France. The Young Lions travel across the Channel next week as they bid to secure their spot at the finals being held in Greece in July. They will play three Elite Round qualifiers, against Denmark on March 26, Azerbaijan on March 28 and France on March 31 with only the team that tops the group advancing to the finals. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, pictured centre with Didier Drogba, has been named in England Under 19s squad . Chelsea's Izzy Brown (left), has also been named in Sean O'Driscoll's side for the European qualifiers . Accordingly, O’Driscoll has selected a strong squad featuring Chelsea players Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Charlie Colkett, Izzy Brown and Joshua Aina. Rising stars from Man City’s academy picked include goalkeeper Angus Gunn, defenders Ashley Smith-Brown and Kean Bryan, and forward Brandon Barker. Demarai Gray, the 18-year-old winger who has made 34 appearances for Birmingham City this season, is included, as is Teddy Bishop, the Ipswich Town midfielder who has played 18 times for Mick McCarthy’s side in 2014-15. With Tottenham’s Dele Alli and Middlesbrough’s Bryn Morris absent through injury, Lewis Cook, the Leeds United midfielder who has made 33 first-team appearances this season, is promoted from the under 18s. Birmingham City's Demarai Gray has also been named having made 34 appearances for the Blues this season . Goalkeepers: Angus Gunn (Manchester City), Freddie Woodman (Newcastle United) Defenders: Ben Chilwell (Leicester City), Ashley Smith-Brown (Manchester City), Joshua Aina (Chelsea), Brendan Galloway (Everton), Joe Gomez (Charlton Athletic), Kean Bryan (Manchester City) Midfielders: Teddy Bishop (Ipswich Town), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea), Charlie Colkett (Chelsea), Harry Winks (Tottenham Hotspur), Lewis Cook (Leeds United) Forwards: Brandon Barker (Manchester City), Demarai Gray (Birmingham City), Patrick Roberts (Fulham), Bradley Fewster (Middlesbrough), Izzy Brown (Chelsea) 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Chelsea player Chelsea has been named in Sean O'Driscoll's side for the European qualifiers.
2. However, the article does not mention Chelsea as one of the players selected for the England Under 19 squad.
3. The article only mentions Izzy Brown, who plays for Chelsea, as one of the selected players.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly includes Chelsea as one of the selected players, when in fact, only Izzy Brown from Chelsea has been selected.

So, the error in the summary is the inclusion of Chelsea as a selected player, when in fact, only Izzy Brown from Chelsea has been selected.
