Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, there are several inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. Value of Dybala: The summary states that the 21-year-old is valued at £30million, but the article does not mention this specific figure. Instead, the article states that Palermo president Mauro Zamparini values Dybala and Vazquez at a combined £50million.
2. Transfer target: The summary states that Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City are interested in signing Dybala, but the article does not mention Arsenal or Chelsea as transfer targets for Dybala. The article only mentions that Manchester City have made an enquiry for Dybala.
3. Sale of Vazquez: The summary mentions that Palermo expect to sell Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez this summer, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a incomplete or inaccurate summary of the article's content.
