    the 21-year-old is valued at # 30million for palermo president mauro zamparini. 

    Article: 
    Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea have all made enquiries for Palermo striker Paulo Dybala. Manchester United have also been to watch the Argentine but he is not high on their list. The 21-year-old is valued at £30million by Palermo president Mauro Zamparini and Juventus are considered favourites even though they have had an opening offer rejected. Paulo Dybala of Palermo is a transfer target for three British clubs in the summer, but may cost £30million . Palermo are also expecting to sell Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez in the summer transfer window . Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are three English clubs interested in signing striker Dybala . Palermo also expect to sell Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez this summer. Zamparini said: 'Dybala and Vazquez will probably be sold this summer. Will they go to Milan? No. 'They are being tracked by Juventus, Arsenal, Barcelona, Manchester City, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain.' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Palermo president Mauro Zamparini values Dybala at #30million, but the article states that Zamparini values Dybala at £30million. #30million is the currency symbol for pounds, not euros, so the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary only mentions Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea as clubs interested in signing Dybala, but the article mentions that Juventus, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain are also tracking Dybala's progress. The summary does not provide a complete list of clubs interested in signing Dybala, so it is not consistent with the article.
3. The summary states that Dybala is a transfer target for three British clubs, but the article states that Dybala is a transfer target for six clubs (Juventus, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain). The summary does not provide an accurate count of the number of clubs interested in signing Dybala, so it is not consistent with the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits information, provides incomplete information, and contains inaccuracies.
