    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was investigated." However, the article states that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested, not after he was investigated. This is a key difference that indicates the summary is not consistent with the article.
2. The summary implies that the investigation into the seven games was triggered by Conrad's investigation, but the article states that the investigation followed a 1-1 draw against Caen last May that kept Nimes in the second division and saw Caen promoted to the top flight. This suggests that the investigation was triggered by the suspicious draw, rather than Conrad's actions.
3. The summary mentions that Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Nimes can appeal the sanction, indicating that the relegation is not yet a certainty.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions that change the meaning of the original text.
