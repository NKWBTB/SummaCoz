Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man was arrested outside a bar in Austin, Texas. This is consistent with the article.
2. The summary states that the man was unable to use his hands and was lying next to several police officers. This is not consistent with the article, as the man was handcuffed and unable to use his hands, but he was not lying next to police officers.
3. The summary states that the escapee suspect was later charged with evading arrest. This is consistent with the article, as the man was charged with evading arrest after he escaped from the police.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the man was lying next to police officers, which is not supported by the information in the article.
