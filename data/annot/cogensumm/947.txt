Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Timing of the fire: The article states that the fire broke out "last night" and was still burning "around midnight," while the summary claims that the blaze "broke out late yesterday."
2. Damage to the tower: The article states that the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, while the summary implies that the tower was not damaged at all.
3. Cause of the fire: The article mentions that the fire broke out in wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower, while the summary does not mention the cause of the fire.

To fix the summary, it should be rewritten to reflect the correct information from the article, such as:

"A fire broke out last night in the wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower of the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow, but the tower itself did not suffer significant damage. The blaze was halted around midnight."

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Timing of the fire: The article states that the fire broke out "last night" and was still burning "around midnight," while the summary claims that the blaze "broke out late yesterday." To fix this, the summary should be revised to reflect the correct timing of the fire.
2. Damage to the tower: The article states that the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, while the summary implies that the tower was not damaged at all. To fix this, the summary should be revised to reflect the correct information about the tower's damage.
3. Cause of the fire: The article mentions that the fire broke out in wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower, while the summary does not mention the cause of the fire. To fix this, the summary should be revised to include the cause of the fire.

By following these steps, the summary can be rewritten to be consistent with the article and provide accurate information about the fire at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow.
