    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the blaze broke out in the tower itself, whereas the article states that the blaze broke out in wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower.
2. The summary states that the tower did not suffer significant damage, whereas the article states that the emergencies ministry for Moscow said the tower itself did not suffer significant damage and the fire's spread had been halted.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that the convent is a top visitor attraction in Moscow and is noted for its buildings and cemetery.
4. The summary does not mention the names of the celebrities buried in the convent's cemetery, such as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Russia's first president, Boris Yeltsin.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the details of the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow. The article provides more specific and accurate information about the location and extent of the blaze, as well as the history and significance of the convent.
