    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Manchester United have been to watch Paulo Dybala, but he is not high on their list. This contradicts the summary, which states that Manchester United have also been to watch the World Cup.
2. The article mentions that Juventus are considered favorites to sign Dybala, despite having an opening offer rejected. This suggests that Juventus are seriously interested in signing him, which is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The article mentions that Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City are interested in signing Dybala, but the summary does not mention this.
4. The article states that Palermo expect to sell both Dybala and Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez in the summer transfer window. This is not mentioned in the summary.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits several key details and includes information that is not supported by the article.
