    Article: 
    Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. Tielemans, 17, has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal also and is a centre midfielder of some promise. He became the youngest Belgian player to play in the UEFA Champions League, making his Champions League debut at the age of 16 years, four months and 25 days in 2013. Chelsea are keen on signing Anderlecht teenagerÂ Youri Tielemans (pictured on the left) Leander Dendoncker is also said to be on Chelsea's radar after impressing for Anderlecht in recent weeks . Dendoncker, 19, is a more defensive player and can operate in midfield or at centre back. He scored Anderlecht's second goal in a feisty 2-0 win over Kortrijk on Sunday which saw both sides reduced to 10 men while Tielemans was one of four players booked. Belgium newspaper HLN reported that Chelsea scout Tony White was in the crowd to watch the game. Meanwhile, Chelsea have extended contracts for 18-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda Jnr to 2019 and his elder brother Tika Musonda until 2016. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker, but the article only mentions Youri Tielemans.

2. The summary mentions that Tielemans has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal, but the article does not mention this.

3. The summary states that Leander Dendoncker is also said to be on Chelsea's radar, but the article only mentions Tielemans as being on Chelsea's radar.

4. The summary mentions that Dendoncker is a more defensive player, but the article does not provide this information.

5. The summary mentions that Chelsea have extended contracts for 18-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda Jnr to 2019 and his elder brother Tika Musonda until 2016, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information about Leander Dendoncker and Charly Musonda Jnr that is not present in the article, and omits information about Tielemans that is present in the article.
