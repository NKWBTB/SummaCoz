    lloris wearing the scarf after defeat by chelsea in the fa cup final. 

    Article: 
    Tottenham's fans may have been sick of the sight of Chelsea blue after their Capital One Cup final defeat, but their captain didn't appear to be. Spurs lost 2-0 to Jose Mourinho's men at Wembley Stadium, but as Hugo Lloris led his team up to collect their loser's medals, he appeared to don a Chelsea scarf. In fairness to the French goalkeeper, he didn't appear to notice it wasn't his team's colours - time playing for Les Bleus will do that to you. As Hugo Lloris goes up to collect his medal, he sees that something has been thrown at him . Without realising that it is a Chelsea scarf, the Tottenham captain picks it up and wraps it round his neck . Lloris wearing the scarf after defeat by Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley . As a clearly distracted Lloris walked up to get the medal, a member of the crowd threw the scarf at him. The former Lyon man then nonchalantly picked it up and chucked it around his neck before trudging onward. It was an unfortunate end to an unfortunate day for Lloris in which he conceded twice after opposition shots took wicked deflections off of his own players. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Hugo Lloris was wearing a Chelsea scarf after Tottenham's defeat in the Capital One Cup final.
2. However, the article states that Lloris picked up a Chelsea scarf that was thrown at him by a member of the crowd, not that he was wearing one beforehand.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Lloris was wearing the scarf as a deliberate choice, whereas the article suggests that it was thrown at him unexpectedly.
4. The article also highlights that Lloris did not appear to notice that the scarf was not his team's colours, which is not mentioned in the summary.
5. Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and therefore it is not consistent with the article.
