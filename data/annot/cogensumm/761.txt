</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Anderlecht are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht. This is not consistent with the article, as Anderlecht is the name of the team, not the club that is doing the scouting.
2. The summary mentions that Tielemans became the youngest Belgian player to play in the UEFA Champions League. This is correct, as stated in the article.
3. The summary states that Tielemans has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal. This is not consistent with the article, as the article only mentions Chelsea as being interested in Tielemans.
4. The summary mentions Leander Dendoncker as being on Chelsea's radar. This is consistent with the article, as the article states that Chelsea are keen on signing both Tielemans and Dendoncker.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that Anderlecht is doing the scouting, and incorrectly mentions Manchester United and Arsenal as being interested in Tielemans.
