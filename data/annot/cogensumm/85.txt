Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, where children had been well-behaved.
2. The article does not mention anything about the Easter bunny being invented in German folklore. Instead, it discusses the modern version of the Easter bunny and how it has become a terrifying character due to botched costumes and inappropriate body language.
3. The article does mention that the Easter bunny is a symbol of joy and happiness, but the summary does not accurately reflect this information.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it only provides a brief and inaccurate description of the Easter bunny, while the article provides a detailed and nuanced discussion of the character.

Therefore, the summary is not a good representation of the article's content.
