    Article: 
    The Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, where an 'Easter Hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Much like Father Christmas, the brown-coloured animals was often depicted carrying a selection of treats to good children's houses. But while the traditional version of the rabbit was a natural-looking creature, the modern character has become an often terrifying white, pink, purple and yellow creation. The Easter bunny is meant to be a joyful character, but often botched costumes mean they are more horrific than happy, as this picture demonstrates . The symbol of the Easter often results in a terrifying sight when produced on a budget. Children who would usually be delighted to be meeting someone who will be gifting them with chocolate eggs end up screaming for their parents. As reported by Metro, unfortunate humans who have been given the task of dressing up as the rabbit end up looking more like the terrifying Donnie Darko character than a friendly furball.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, but the article does not mention the Easter bunny's origin.
2. The summary mentions that the Easter bunny is a "joyful character," but the article describes the Easter bunny as "terrifying" and "creepy" in many instances.
3. The summary does not mention the article's focus on the negative and frightening aspects of the Easter bunny costume, such as the botched costumes, terrifying appearance, and inappropriate behavior.
4. The summary does not mention the article's use of humorous and satirical language to describe the Easter bunny, such as "terrifying Donnie Darko character" and "evil-looking bunny."

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content and tone of the article. It presents a more positive and lighthearted view of the Easter bunny, while the article is focused on the humorous and satirical aspects of the character's depiction.
