    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of any games being arrested. Instead, the article states that Jean-Marc Conrad, the former president of Nimes, was arrested last November for his involvement in match-fixing.

2. The article does mention that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad's arrest, but this is not the same as saying that the games were arrested. The word "arrested" implies that the games themselves were taken into custody, which is not what happened.

3. Additionally, the summary states that Nimes was arrested last November, which is not accurate. It was Jean-Marc Conrad, the former president of Nimes, who was arrested, not the club itself.

4. Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and misleading information. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article.
