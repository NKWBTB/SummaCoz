Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that "seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested last November."
2. This implies that Conrad's arrest was the trigger for the investigation, and not the other way around.
3. However, the summary states that "seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November," which is not supported by the article.
4. The article does not mention any games being arrested, only that seven games were investigated after Conrad's arrest.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it falsely states that games were arrested, whereas the article only mentions that games were investigated.
