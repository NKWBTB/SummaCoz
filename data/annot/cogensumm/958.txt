</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "the words 'christ' have been placed on a list of banned words by marks & spencer." This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are not allowed in gift messages, but does not say that they have been placed on a list of banned words.
2. The summary also states that "jihad, Buddha and Allah are accepted," which is not consistent with the article, as the article only mentions that "jihad" is accepted, but does not mention Buddha or Allah.
3. The summary states that "one customer was stopped from buying a #35 bouquet for a funeral," but the article does not mention any specific customer being stopped from buying a bouquet.
4. The summary does not mention the reason why "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are not allowed in gift messages, while the article explains that it is to prevent their misuse.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
