</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of any games being arrested.
2. The article states that Jean-Marc Conrad, the former president of Nimes, was arrested last November for his involvement in match-fixing. This is different from the summary, which suggests that the games were arrested.
3. The article does not mention any games being arrested, only that Jean-Marc Conrad was arrested. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
4. The summary should have read "Jean-Marc Conrad, the former president of Nimes, was arrested last November for his involvement in match-fixing" instead of "seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November."
5. The summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that games were arrested, when in fact it was only Jean-Marc Conrad who was arrested.
