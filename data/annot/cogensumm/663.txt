    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November. However, the article does not mention any arrests of Nimes players or officials. Instead, it mentions that Jean-Marc Conrad, the former president of Nimes, was arrested last November for his involvement in match-fixing.
2. The article states that Conrad was found guilty of trying to fix four matches as Nimes fought off relegation last season. The summary does not mention any information about the matches being fixed or any charges being filed against Nimes players or officials.
3. The article mentions that Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season as a result of the match-fixing scandal, but the summary does not mention this information.
4. The summary does not provide any supporting evidence or details about the investigation or the charges filed against Conrad. The article provides more information about the investigation and the charges, including the fact that preliminary charges of corruption have been filed against Caen president Jean-Francois Fortin and Conrad.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the investigation and charges filed against Nimes and its officials. The article provides more detailed and accurate information about the match-fixing scandal and the consequences for Nimes and its officials.
