Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "k'' can also be included in messages."
2. However, the article states that "k''" (with the apostrophe) is not a word and cannot be used in gift messages.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that "k''" is a valid word that can be used in messages, which is not true according to the article.
4. The article specifically states that "Jesus" and "Christ" are banned words, but the summary does not mention this.
5. Therefore, the summary is not accurate and does not accurately represent the information in the article.
