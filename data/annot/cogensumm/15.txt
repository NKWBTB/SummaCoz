    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary statement "k'' can also be included in messages" is not consistent with the article:

1. The article states that the words "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are banned words in Marks & Spencer's gift messages, but the summary does not mention this.
2. The article mentions that other banned words include "f***" and "gay", but the summary does not mention these words either.
3. The summary implies that all words can be included in messages, which is not accurate according to the article.
4. The article states that the automatic phrase checker includes hundreds of words of varying nature, but the summary does not provide any information about the scope of the phrase checker.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. Specifically, it does not mention the banned words, the scope of the phrase checker, or the context in which the words are being used.
