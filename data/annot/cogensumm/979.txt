About 1,000 farms in the country supply KFC with 23million chickens a year. The programme focuses on a farmer called Andrew who says the chickens at his farm – left to do nothing but eat and drink until they reach the required weight – have a good life, saying he ‘wouldn’t mind being a chicken in here’. Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: ‘No, no, no, that’s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.’ The supplier, who has 35 years’ experience, says: ‘As you can see, they’ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they’ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can’t think there’s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.’ Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: ‘No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.’ Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: ‘These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays .

The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . ‘Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. ‘These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter. A great number suffer broken bones during this process.’ A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers ‘an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK’s most recognisable businesses’. It is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. A KFC spokesman said: ‘Animal welfare is essential for high quality food and is important to our customers, and all of KFC’s suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements. KFC was the first quick-service restaurant to gain Red Tractor certification and we have in place our own robust standard, which is independently audited by third parties.’ Episode one of The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop airs on BBC1 at 9pm.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Number of chickens: The summary states "23million chickens a year" while the article states "almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute." This is a significant discrepancy, as 23 million chickens per year is much lower than almost 400 pieces per minute.
2. Length of life: The summary states "the chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed," while the article states "the chickens have a very good life, saying he ‘wouldn’t mind being a chicken in here’." This suggests that the chickens are living a good life, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that they are only alive for 35 days.
3. Farmer's claims: The summary states "the farmer in charge claims it's 'a very good life'", while the article states "the farmer in charge claims the birds have 'a very good life' and shows how they were healthy." This suggests that the farmer is positive about the chickens' living conditions, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that the chickens have a short and oppressive life.
4. Animal welfare: The summary does not mention anything about animal welfare, while the article states "animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’." This suggests that the summary does not provide a complete picture of the living conditions of the chickens.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the number of chickens, the length of their lives, the farmer's claims, and the issue of animal welfare. The article provides a more detailed and nuanced view of the living conditions of the chickens raised for KFC.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that KFC has 23 million chickens a year, and images show tens of thousands of chickens kept together in huge sheds, alive for just 35 days before they are gassed. The farmer in charge claims it's 'a very good life', and Andrew is shown in the shed filled with 34,000 chickens destined for KFC.
2. However, the article provides additional details about the conditions on the farms supplying KFC with 23 million chickens a year. The documentary focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows, and the footage shows the birds living amid their excrement. The farmer, Andrew, claims that the chickens have 'a very good life', but animal rights campaigners describe their lives as 'oppressive'. The summary does not mention the conditions activists find oppressive.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary does not include information about the activists describing the lives of the KFC chickens as 'oppressive' due to the conditions in the sheds.
