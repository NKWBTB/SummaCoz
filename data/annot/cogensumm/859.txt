</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Hugh Jackman spent months working with Australia's most remote Indigenous communities. However, the article does not mention anything about Jackman working in remote communities. Instead, it states that he spent time living in remote communities and learned about the Indigenous way of life.
2. The summary also states that Jackman has added his voice to an effort to stop the West Australian government's effort to shut down remote communities. However, the article does not mention anything about Jackman speaking out against the government's plan. Instead, it states that he has thrown his support behind efforts to stop the forced closure of some remote communities.
3. The summary mentions that Jackman was lobbied by Indigenous fans who called on him to step up and announce his support. However, the article does not mention anything about fans lobbying Jackman. Instead, it states that he was inspired by the Indigenous people's sense of community and togetherness.
4. The summary states that the sign aimed at Jackman's read "I SUPPORT YOU". However, the article does not mention anything about a sign being aimed at Jackman. Instead, it states that Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while "nursing a broken heart" in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains inaccuracies and exaggerations, such as Jackman working in remote communities, speaking out against the government's plan, and being lobbied by Indigenous fans. The article provides a more accurate account of Jackman's experiences and views on Indigenous communities.
