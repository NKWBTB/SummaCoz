    It's a chapter of Hugh Jackman's life not many people know about. The Hollywood star once said he only 'truly grew up' when he spent months working with in Australia's most remote Indigenous communities. Now he has added his voice to an effort to stop the West Australian government's effort to shut down as many as half of the state's 270 remote communities. Scroll down for video . Lending his voice: Movie star Hugh Jackman has thrown his support behind efforts to stop the forced closure of some remote Indigenous communities . Jackman was lobbied by Indigenous fans who called on him to step up and announce his support . A young child wields the sign aimed at Jackman, who has expressed how grateful he is for the time he has spent in remote communities . 'This is my country': As many as a thousand people could be forced to move if the WA State Government plan goes ahead . In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations. I SUPPORT YOU'. Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said. He told his father 'I think I'm going to live out here forever' but his father said he should finish college first and evaluate his options then. The X-Men star said he was inspired by the Indigenous people's sense of community and togetherness.

In an interview with a Canadian broadcaster years ago, Jackman said he was tempted to live in the outback with remote communities for a long time .

What do I want to say?' he said. Jackman, who was schooled at the prestigious Knox Grammar on Sydney's leafy north shore, said he had not even learned about the Stolen Generations. Blasting the PM's remarks on the issue last week, Indigenous leader Warren Mundine said living on the land was essential for the nation's first people. 'It's about their life, it's about their very essence, it's about their very culture'. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Hugh Jackman "threw his support behind efforts to stop the forced closure of some remote Indigenous communities," but the article does not mention anything about Jackman supporting any specific efforts to stop the closures. Instead, the article states that Jackman expressed his support for the Indigenous people and their connection to the land.
2. The summary mentions that Jackman was "lobbied by Indigenous fans who called on him to step up and announce his support," but the article does not mention any fans lobbying Jackman. Instead, the article states that Jackman reflected on his experience living in remote communities and expressed his gratitude for the time he spent there.
3. The summary mentions that Jackman "has spent months working with Australia's most remote Indigenous communities," but the article does not specify how long Jackman spent in these communities. The article only states that he "lived in a remote community" for a period of time.
4. The summary states that Jackman "added his voice to an effort to stop the forced closure of some remote communities," but the article does not mention any specific efforts to stop the closures. Instead, the article states that Jackman expressed his support for the Indigenous people and their connection to the land.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes specific details that are not present in the article, such as Jackman supporting specific efforts to stop the closures and being lobbied by Indigenous fans. Additionally, the summary exaggerates the extent of Jackman's involvement with remote Indigenous communities and his level of support for the Indigenous people.
