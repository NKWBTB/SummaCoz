    Article: 
    A hound's howl breaks through the cold rainfall. Dozens more hounds emerge from a stand of trees and bound across a field in search of a fox's scent. Horses carrying riders in red and black coats follow from a ways behind, quickly disappearing again over a hillcrest, minutes away from Baltimore's growing suburbs. The Elkridge-Harford Hunt Club has roots dating back to 1878, but records show organized foxhunts took place in Maryland as early as the 1790s.

In many places red foxes are a rarity in the US so the hounds chase coyotes - a distant cousin of the fox - instead. But from dress to decorum, many of the traditions remain unaltered from its inception.
