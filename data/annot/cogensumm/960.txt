    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Marks & Spencer has placed "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" on a list of banned words, but the article only mentions that these words are included in an automatic phrase checker to prevent their misuse.
2. The summary implies that the policy is to ban any messages containing these words, but the article states that the automatic phrase checker is in place to prevent the misuse of certain words, and that some terms, including jihad, Buddha, and Allah, are accepted.
3. The summary mentions that customers are prevented from completing their order if they include any blocked words in their message, but the article states that the automatic phrase checker pops up if any blocked words are entered, and that customers can still complete their order if they remove the blocked words.
4. The summary includes the statement that "Terrorist" and "d**k" can also be included in messages, but this is not mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the scope of Marks & Spencer's policy and includes inaccurate information.
