</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "the words 'christ' have been placed on a list of banned words by marks & spencer." This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are not allowed in gift messages, but does not mention anything about a list of banned words.
2. The summary also states that "jesus christ" is on the list of banned words, which is not supported by the article. The article only mentions "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" as the banned words, without mentioning "Jesus" separately.
3. The summary states that "f ***" and "gay" are also banned words, which is consistent with the article. However, the article also mentions that "jihad," "Buddha," and "Allah" are accepted, while the summary does not mention this.
4. The summary states that the policy emerged after one customer was stopped from buying a £35 bouquet, which is consistent with the article. However, the summary does not mention the specific reason for the policy, which is that the customer's gift message contained the word "Christ Church Teddington."

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the information about the banned words and the reason for the policy. The summary is missing important details and includes some inaccuracies, which can lead to confusion for the reader.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that 'Jesus Christ' is among the banned words and that a customer was stopped from buying a £35 bouquet due to the banned words.
2. However, the article states that 'Jesus Christ' and 'Christ' are included in the list of banned words to prevent their misuse, but it does not mention that a customer was stopped from buying a bouquet with these words. The article provides a specific example of a customer being prevented from completing the order due to mentioning 'Christ Church Teddington' in the gift message.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that a customer was stopped from buying a bouquet because of the banned words 'Jesus Christ,' while the article states that the specific incident involved the mention of 'Christ Church Teddington' in the gift message, not just the words 'Jesus Christ.'
