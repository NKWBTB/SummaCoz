    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "seven games involving Nimes were arrested last November." This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Jean-Marc Conrad, the former president of Nimes, was arrested last November, not the games.
2. The article states that the French league disciplinary commission found that Conrad tried to fix four matches as Nimes fought off relegation last season. This is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The summary mentions that Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season, but the article does not say this. Instead, the article states that Nimes can appeal the sanction.
4. The summary does not mention the investigation into the 1-1 draw between Nimes and Caen last May, which is a significant detail in the article.
5. The summary does not mention the charges of corruption filed against Caen president Jean-Francois Fortin, which is also a significant detail in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and there are several key details that are missing or incorrect.
