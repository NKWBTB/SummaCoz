    Summary: 
    mohammad irfan will miss the remainder of the world cup with a pelvis. 

    Article: 
    Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury. Left-armer Irfan, who has taken eight wickets in five matches so far, underwent an MRI scan after sitting out Pakistan's seven-wicket win over Ireland on Sunday with pain in his hip. After an initial scan proved inconclusive on Monday, Irfan underwent further tests on Tuesday where it was confirmed the seven-foot bowler had suffered 'an obvious stress fracture in the pelvis', according to a Pakistan Cricket Board statement. Mohammad Irfan will take no further part in the World Cup after scans revealed he has a fractured pelvis . Irfan had taken eight wickets in the first five games for Pakistan before missing the Ireland match . Team physiotherapist Brad Robinson said: 'This injury rules Irfan out of the World Cup.' Pakistan face Australia on March 20 in Adelaide, with a potential semi-final against defending champions India at stake, should the latter beat Bangladesh. Pakistan will wait until after the quarter-final before deciding whether to call up a replacement for Irfan. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury.
2. However, the article states that Irfan will take no further part in the World Cup after scans revealed he has a fractured pelvis.
3. The word "remainder" implies that Irfan would miss only a part of the tournament, but the article states that he will miss the entire tournament.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Irfan will only miss a portion of the tournament, while the article states that he will miss the entire tournament.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it implies that Irfan will only miss a portion of the tournament, while the article states that he will miss the entire tournament.
