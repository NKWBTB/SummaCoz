    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help you identify the inconsistencies in the summary. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary states that Sam Livesey was captured on a clip of Oldham's Jack Tuohy, and that he could face a lengthy ban after the FA intervened. However, the article does not mention a clip of Jack Tuohy. Instead, it states that Sam Livesey was dismissed by the referee in Oldham Under 18's 7-2 win over their Lancashire rivals.

Step 2: Analyze the article

The article states that Sam Livesey has been charged with violent conduct by the FA, and that he has admitted the charge. The article also mentions that Jack Tuohy was knocked from his feet by the force of Sam Livesey's alleged punch, and that he spent four hours at the hospital after the game due to concussion-like symptoms.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistencies in the summary

Based on the analysis in Step 2, the inconsistencies in the summary are:

* The summary states that Sam Livesey was captured on a clip of Jack Tuohy, but the article does not mention a clip of Jack Tuohy.
* The summary states that Jack Tuohy was knocked from his feet by the force of Sam Livesey's alleged punch, but the article does not mention any provocation or violence by Sam Livesey.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistencies

The inconsistencies in the summary are likely due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the article. The article does not mention a clip of Jack Tuohy, and it does not describe any provocation or violence by Sam Livesey. Instead, it states that Sam Livesey has been charged with violent conduct by the FA, and that he has admitted the charge. The summary may have misinterpreted or exaggerated the information in the article, leading to the inconsistencies.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states sam livesey, 18, was captured on a clip of oldham's jack tuohy. But the truth in article is Sam Livesey, 18, was captured on a clip obtained by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy in the temple, it was capture by Sportsmail not the oldham's jack tuohy.
