</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat for Manuel Pellegrini's successor, implying that Mancini is putting pressure on Pellegrini to perform.
2. However, the article states that Mancini was sacked by Manchester City in 2013, which means he is not currently the manager of the team and cannot be putting pressure on Pellegrini.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that Mancini is still the manager of Manchester City and is putting pressure on Pellegrini, which is not true.
4. The article states that Pellegrini is under pressure to save Manchester City's season and his job, but there is no mention of Mancini putting pressure on him.
5. The summary is a simplification of the article, but it is not an accurate representation of the content. It is not consistent with the article because it implies that Mancini is still the manager of Manchester City and is putting pressure on Pellegrini, which is not true.
