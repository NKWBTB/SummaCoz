    google dubbed the first set of several thousand glass glass users. 

    Article: 
    It was seen as one Google's highest profile failures, and forced the firm stop selling itsprototype  wearable computer in a pair of glasses. However, Google boss Eric Schmidt has confirmed that in fact the project is still going strong - and remains  'a big and very fundamental platform for Google'. Schmidt told The Wall Street Journal that it has been put under the control of Tony Fadell 'to make it ready for users.' Scroll down for video . Google boss Eric Schmidt has confirmed that in fact the project is still going strong - and remains 'a big and very fundamental platform for Google'. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users . as 'Explorers.' But, as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew . stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of . surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy . intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as 'Glassholes.' 'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Google stopped selling the first version of Glass and shut its Explorer program in January, moving the project out of its Google X research lab into a standalone unit. Ivy Ross remained head of the Glass team but Tony Fadell, head of Google's Nest connected home division, now oversees strategy for the project. Cources claim Fadell wants to redesign the headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until 'it's perfect'. 'It is a big and very fundamental platform for Google,' Schmidt told the WSJ. 'We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project, which isn't true. 'Google is about taking risks and there's nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we're ending it.' He said Glass, like Google's self-driving car, is a long-term project. 'That's like saying the self-driving car is a disappointment because it's not driving me around now,' he said. 'These things take time.' Sources claim Glass' new boss Tony Fadell (pictured) wants to redesign the Google headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until it's complete. One unnamed source told the New York Times that Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect' The firm brought in Tony Fadell from Nest - a home automation company Google bought in 2014 - to lead the team, replacing previous boss Ivy Ross. Ms Ross still works on the project and runs 'day-to-day' operations. In a statement in January, Mr Fadell said: 'Early Glass efforts have broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike. 'I'm excited to be working with Ivy to provide direction and support as she leads the team and we work together to integrate those learnings into future products.' An unnamed source added Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect.' The previous Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (£990), and was launched in the US in 2013, and the UK last summer. Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset (pictured) last month. It didn't abandon the project entirely, though, and promised to develop smart glasses under a different guise . Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave developers the chance to buy Glass (pictured) for $1,500 (£990), and launched in the US in 2013 . The firm had already been thought to be developing a new version, with chips made by Intel, to go on sale later this year. Aside from saying it was committed to working on the future of the product, Google gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product. 'It's hard to believe Glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop,' the Glass team said in a post on Google+ last month. 'We kept on it, and when it started to come together, we began the Glass Explorer Program as a kind of 'open beta' to hear what people had to say.' 'Glass was in its infancy, and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk. 'Well, we still have some work to do, but now we're ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run.' Google boss Sergey Brin (pictured) was spotted without the high-tech specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event last year. Since the headset was unveiled in 2013, the 41-year-old was rarely seen without them. This fuelled rumours that Google was looking to abandon the headset . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Google dubbed the first set of Glass users as "Explorers," but the article does not mention this.
2. The summary mentions that Google stopped selling the first version of Glass and shut down its Explorer program, but the article states that Google did not cancel the project and is still working on it.
3. The summary states that Tony Fadell, the new boss of the Glass team, wants to redesign the headset from scratch and won't release it until it's perfect, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary mentions that the previous Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the Explorer program, but the article states that the headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme.
5. The summary states that Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset last month, but the article states that Google did not abandon the project entirely and is still working on it.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not mentioned in the article, such as Google dubbing the first set of Glass users as "Explorers" and Tony Fadell wanting to redesign the headset from scratch. Additionally, the summary contains information that is not accurate, such as the statement that Google killed off the current version of its Glass headset.
