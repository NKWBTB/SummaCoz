Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the home was built for inspection just a day after Malcolm Fraser's sudden passing, implying that the home was built after his death. However, the article states that the home was built three years after the Frasers married, which was before Malcolm Fraser became prime minister.
2. The summary does not mention the article's information about the home being open for inspection just a day after Malcolm Fraser's death.
3. The summary does not mention the article's information about the home being up for sale for around $2 million.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
