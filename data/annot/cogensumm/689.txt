    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the home was built for inspection just a day after Malcolm Fraser's sudden passing, implying that the home was built after his death. However, the article states that the home was built three years after the Frasers married, which was before Malcolm Fraser's death.
2. The summary mentions that the home is up for sale for about $2 million, but the article does not mention anything about the home being for sale.
3. The summary states that the property was last sold 20 years ago, but the article does not mention anything about the property being sold before.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information about the timing of the home's construction and sale, and it omits important details about the history of the property.
