Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the death of Sophia Walker is being treated as "unexplained" by Police Scotland.
2. The summary states that the death is a "tragic death".

Reasoning:

The summary uses the word "tragic" to describe the death, which implies that the cause of death is already known and is a tragic event. However, the article states that the death is being treated as "unexplained", which means that the cause of death is not yet known.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the cause of death is known, while the article states that the cause of death is not yet known.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of Sophia Walker. It also mentions that the mother, Patricia Hodgdon, is heartbroken after her three-month-old daughter was found dead. The summary notes that Sophia was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father.
