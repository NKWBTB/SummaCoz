    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the fire broke out in the wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower, but the article states that the fire broke out in the bell tower itself.
2. The summary says that the tower did not suffer significant damage, but the article states that the fire's spread was halted around midnight, suggesting that the tower was damaged.
3. The summary mentions that the convent is a top visitor attraction, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary states that the convent was founded in the 1520s, but the article states that it was built in the so-called Moscow Baroque style, which suggests a later date.
5. The summary mentions that the convent is noted for its buildings and cemetery, but the article focuses more on the historical and artistic significance of the convent.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The article provides more detailed and accurate information about the fire at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow.
