    Article: 
    The NFL have fined the Atlanta Falcons and stripped them of a draft pick  following the team's use of fake crowd noise at home games. In a statement released on Monday, the league announced that the Falcons have been fined $350,000 (£237,000) and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft. If the Falcons have multiple picks in that round, the highest selection will be forfeited. Team president Rich McKay has also been suspended from the league's Competition Committee beginning April 1. Atlanta Falcons have been fined £237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome . Owner Arthur Blank acknowledged the team's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . The NFL noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the Falcons violated league rules that state 'at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.' The league also said Roddy White, the team's former director of event marketing, was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club. The Falcons fired him. The league determined that Falcons ownership and senior executives, including McKay, were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise. But as the senior club executive overseeing game operations, McKay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules. McKay can petition Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than June 30. The Falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Falcons president Rick McKay has been suspended from his position on NFL Competition Committee . Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in early February that he had seen enough of the NFL's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club. 'It's not really a fine line,' Blank said. 'I think what we've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong. Anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field, we're opposed to, as a league, as a club and as an owner. It's obviously embarrassing but beyond embarrassing it doesn't represent our culture and what we're about.' The Falcons say 101 of 103 games have been sellouts since Blank bought the team in 2002. Actual turnouts declined during losing seasons the last two years. Atlanta ranked 10th among the 32 NFL teams with its average home attendance of 72,130 in 2014. Construction is underway for a new $1.4 billion stadium that will replace the Georgia Dome in 2017. The new stadium will have a similar seating capacity. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify the reasons why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistencies
The summary states that the Atlanta Falcons were fined $350,000 and stripped of a draft pick, while the article states that the team was fined £237,000 and the draft pick forfeiture is not mentioned. Additionally, the summary mentions that team president Rich McKay was suspended from the league's Competition Committee, but this is not mentioned in the article.

Step 2: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies
The reason for the inconsistency in the fine amount is likely due to the conversion rate between US dollars and British pounds. The article states that the fine is £237,000, which is approximately $350,000 USD. However, the summary only mentions the US dollar amount without specifying the conversion rate.

Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the inconsistencies
The inconsistency in the fine amount does not have a significant impact on the overall message of the article, as the amount is still substantial and serves as a punishment for the team's violation of league rules. However, the inconsistency in the information about Rich McKay's suspension could potentially be misleading, as it may give the impression that he was suspended from the Competition Committee, which is not mentioned in the article.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion
Based on the analysis, the summary is not consistent with the article due to inconsistencies in the fine amount and the information about Rich McKay's suspension. The inconsistencies do not have a significant impact on the overall message of the article, but they could potentially be misleading. It is important to ensure that summaries accurately reflect the information in the original article to avoid confusion and misinterpretation.
