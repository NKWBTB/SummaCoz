Adem said: 'Ziggy has always picked things up really quickly - for example it only took a few days for him to learn how to ride a skateboard, but learning to say hello took much longer. 'Recently we have focused on teaching him routines rather than new tricks and we reward him with positive reinforcement - praise, love, cuddles and of course treats and toys.

Adem said: 'A lot of people judge Staffies and think that the breed is dangerous. But this is not true, they are no more dangerous than any other breed of dog. 'Staffordshire Bull Terriers are very intelligent, loving and loyal - but sadly this doesn't stop people mistreating or abandoning them. 'Most rescue centres are filled with unwanted Staffies and they are having difficulty re-homing them. 'The breed gets a lot of negative speculation which definitely does not help the situation and people may not want to adopt them, and as a result many are being put down. If people stopped judging them and started helping them, it would really make a difference and prevent so many good dogs being put to sleep.'
