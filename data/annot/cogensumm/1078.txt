    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Roma and Everton have asked to be kept informed about Andre Ayew's status, but the article only mentions Tottenham and Roma as having expressed interest in the player.
2. The summary states that Andre Ayew has netted six times for Marseille this season, but the article states that he has netted six goals for Marseille this season, as well as scoring three during the Africa Cup of Nations.
3. The summary does not mention Moussa Konate, who is mentioned in the article as another target for Newcastle.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits information about Tottenham's interest, includes an incorrect number of goals scored by Andre Ayew, and fails to mention Moussa Konate.
