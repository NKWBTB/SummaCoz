Chelsea are keen on signing Anderlecht teenagerÂ Youri Tielemans (pictured on the left) Leander Dendoncker is also said to be on Chelsea's radar after impressing for Anderlecht in recent weeks . Dendoncker, 19, is a more defensive player and can operate in midfield or at centre back. He scored Anderlecht's second goal in a feisty 2-0 win over Kortrijk on Sunday which saw both sides reduced to 10 men while Tielemans was one of four players booked. Belgium newspaper HLN reported that Chelsea scout Tony White was in the crowd to watch the game. Meanwhile, Chelsea have extended contracts for 18-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda Jnr to 2019 and his elder brother Tika Musonda until 2016.
