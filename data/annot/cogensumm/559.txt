     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Arsenal has been on the 21-year-old's case since last season, implying that they have been pursuing him for a long time. However, the article states that Arsenal and Manchester City have only been tracking him since last season, which contradicts the summary's claim.
2. The summary mentions that Arsenal has been on the 21-year-old's case since last season, but the article states that both Arsenal and Manchester City have been paying close attention to his displays in recent months. This suggests that the clubs' interest in the player is more recent than the summary implies.
3. The summary states that Arsenal and Manchester City are keen on the player, but the article only mentions that the clubs are tracking him. This implies that the clubs are not yet committed to signing the player, which contradicts the summary's assertion that they have been on his case since last season.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the length of time that Arsenal has been pursuing the player and implies that they are more committed to signing him than the article suggests.
