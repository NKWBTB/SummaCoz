     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
2. The summary implies that Radio Rentals relies solely on Centrelink payments for its income, but the article states that the company also makes money from other sources, such as entertainment items like flat screen TVs.
3. The summary mentions that Radio Rentals' reliance on Centrelink payments is a "shocking reality," but the article does not present this information as shocking or surprising.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that Centrepay is a voluntary bill-paying service offered by Centrelink, which is mentioned in the article.
5. The summary does not mention the concerns raised by the Consumer Action Law Centre about the consumer lease industry's use of the Centrepay system, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information presented in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
