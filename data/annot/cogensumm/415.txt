Truck: A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety . Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, said that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor . Rare: spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being darted, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine . A necropsy will be performed on the mountain lion. A spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being struck with a tranquilizer, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine. 'They tried to do the right thing,' Foy told NBC. 'They have the training and equipment to do the right thing... and it doesn't always work out.' A witness told KTLA that the animal was underneath a trailer for about 45 minutes before authorities arrived. The mall wasn't open, and only a few store employees were around in the early hours. But the mountain lion was reportedly first spotted near a freeway. The animal was not aggressive, the LAT Times reports. Officials say the animal could have made his way to the mall area for a number of reasons including simply looking for a suitable habitat.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the mountain lion died while being transported to another location for public safety.
2. The summary states that the lion died while being transported to the hospital.
3. The article does not mention anything about the mountain lion being transported to the hospital. Instead, it states that the lion was to be transported to another location for public safety.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the lion was being transported to the hospital, when in fact, the article states that the lion was to be transported to another location for public safety.

So, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information.
