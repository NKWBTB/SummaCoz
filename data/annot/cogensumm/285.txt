    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    eu will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country. 

    Article: 
    Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders. Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK, the Mail can reveal. Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Tighter measures: Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade. This would disclose whether they had a clean criminal record or had committed offences. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘This power will enable us to require those applying for a visa to provide a criminal record certificate covering the last ten years – an additional tool to help stop criminals from coming to our country.’ Some 1.9million people arriving on visitor visas, or those from 56 countries and territories which do not need visas, will not need to provide their criminal histories because this would be ‘disproportionate’ in terms of time, cost and bureaucracy. The system will also exempt under-18s, asylum seekers and those people where it is not ‘reasonably practicable’. Tougher stance: Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years."
2. The summary states that "eu will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country."
3. The article does not mention anything about the EU or criminal records certificates for EU citizens. The article only refers to non-EU migrants.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it applies a requirement to EU citizens, which is not mentioned in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly applies a requirement to EU citizens, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only applies this requirement to non-EU migrants.
