    Article: 
    Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury. Left-armer Irfan, who has taken eight wickets in five matches so far, underwent an MRI scan after sitting out Pakistan's seven-wicket win over Ireland on Sunday with pain in his hip. After an initial scan proved inconclusive on Monday, Irfan underwent further tests on Tuesday where it was confirmed the seven-foot bowler had suffered 'an obvious stress fracture in the pelvis', according to a Pakistan Cricket Board statement. Mohammad Irfan will take no further part in the World Cup after scans revealed he has a fractured pelvis . Irfan had taken eight wickets in the first five games for Pakistan before missing the Ireland match . Team physiotherapist Brad Robinson said: 'This injury rules Irfan out of the World Cup.' Pakistan face Australia on March 20 in Adelaide, with a potential semi-final against defending champions India at stake, should the latter beat Bangladesh. Pakistan will wait until after the quarter-final before deciding whether to call up a replacement for Irfan. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain the reasons why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury, but the article states that he will take no further part in the World Cup after scans revealed he has a fractured pelvis. This implies that he will not be able to play any further matches in the World Cup, but the summary does not mention this.
2. The summary states that Irfan has taken three wickets in five matches so far, but the article states that he had taken eight wickets in the first five games for Pakistan before missing the Ireland match. This discrepancy suggests that the summary is not accurately representing Irfan's performance in the World Cup.
3. The summary states that Irfan is a left-armer, but the article does not mention his bowling arm. This is a minor discrepancy, but it suggests that the summary may not be entirely accurate.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent Irfan's performance in the World Cup and does not mention his fractured pelvis, which rules him out of the remainder of the tournament.
