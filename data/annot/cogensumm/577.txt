    It's a chapter of Hugh Jackman's life not many people know about. The Hollywood star once said he only 'truly grew up' when he spent months working with in Australia's most remote Indigenous communities. Now he has added his voice to an effort to stop the West Australian government's effort to shut down as many as half of the state's 270 remote communities. Scroll down for video . Lending his voice: Movie star Hugh Jackman has thrown his support behind efforts to stop the forced closure of some remote Indigenous communities . Jackman was lobbied by Indigenous fans who called on him to step up and announce his support . A young child wields the sign aimed at Jackman, who has expressed how grateful he is for the time he has spent in remote communities . 'This is my country': As many as a thousand people could be forced to move if the WA State Government plan goes ahead . In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations. I SUPPORT YOU'. Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said. He told his father 'I think I'm going to live out here forever' but his father said he should finish college first and evaluate his options then. The X-Men star said he was inspired by the Indigenous people's sense of community and togetherness.

The rally was part of a national day of action against the proposed closures . In an interview with a Canadian broadcaster years ago, Jackman said he was tempted to live in the outback with remote communities for a long time . He was angered by the media's constant focus on the problems in Indigenous communities, rather than the positives. 'It really was where I think I grew up. Who am I? What do I want to do? What do I want to say?' he said. Jackman, who was schooled at the prestigious Knox Grammar on Sydney's leafy north shore, said he had not even learned about the Stolen Generations. Blasting the PM's remarks on the issue last week, Indigenous leader Warren Mundine said living on the land was essential for the nation's first people. 'It's about their life, it's about their very essence, it's about their very culture'. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Hugh Jackman has added his voice to an effort to shut down half of the state's 270 remote communities, while the article states that he has thrown his support behind efforts to stop the forced closure of some remote Indigenous communities. The wording in the summary is not consistent with the article's focus on Indigenous communities.
2. The summary implies that Hugh Jackman is advocating for the shutdown of communities, while the article states that he is supporting efforts to stop their forced closure. This is a significant difference in tone and message.
3. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, which focuses on Hugh Jackman's personal experiences living in remote Indigenous communities and his support for Indigenous leaders who are critical of the state government's plans. The summary does not mention these personal experiences or the leaders' criticisms.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article's emphasis on the importance of the land to Indigenous identity and culture. The summary does not mention the land or the cultural significance of the remote communities.

Overall, the summary is not a accurate reflection of the content of the article. It does not accurately represent Hugh Jackman's views on the issue, and it does not accurately reflect the focus of the article.
