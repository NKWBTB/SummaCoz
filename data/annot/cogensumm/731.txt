The Championship promotion hopefuls had made enquiries about signing Jordan Rhodes from Blackburn Rovers but the Ewood Park club's reluctance to deal has prompted fresh questions about McCormack. The Scotland international made an £11million move from Leeds in the summer but the move has backfired with Fulham falling perilously close to the relegation places in recent weeks. Fulham striker Ross McCormack battles with Bournemouth's Matt Ritchie during their clash at Craven Cottage . Fulham striker McCormack gets his shot away as Fulham take on Watford in the Championship . McCormack has been linked with a move to promotion hopefuls Derby County as Fulham stutter in the division . McCormack, 28, has still managed 12 goals in a struggling side and Derby are keen to see if Fulham will loan him with a view to a permanent deal should they go up.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions Fulham winning on Watford, but the article does not mention any such match or victory for Fulham.
2. The summary states that Ross McCormack gets his shot away, but the article does not mention any specific shots or goals scored by McCormack.
3. The summary mentions Derby County's interest in signing McCormack, but the article only mentions that Derby County have revived their interest in signing him, without specifying any actual transfer or signing.
4. The summary implies that McCormack is a Fulham player, but the article states that he is a Scotland international who made an £11million move from Leeds in the summer, and that Fulham are struggling in the division.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains specific details that are not mentioned in the article, and it implies a different situation than the one described in the article.
