</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Fulham striker Ross McCormack "gets his shot away as Fulham win on Watford."
2. However, the article states that Fulham have been struggling in the Championship and have only won three games this year.
3. Therefore, it is unlikely that Fulham would have won a game against Watford, as the article states that they have been in poor form.
4. As the summary is not consistent with the article, it is likely that the summary is incorrect or misleading.
5. Specifically, the phrase "Fulham win on Watford" is not supported by the article, as Fulham have been losing more games than they have been winning.
6. Therefore, the summary is not a accurate reflection of the article's content.
