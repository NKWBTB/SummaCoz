Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary states that Noah Thomas was first missed at 9am, but the article states that his mother last saw him in the living room watching cartoons at 9am and then went back to bed.
2. The summary does not mention that the mother saw the boy at 9am but went back to bed, which is a crucial detail in the article.
3. The summary states that the search has widened, but the article states that the search has been focused on the boy's house and the surrounding area.
4. The summary mentions that the boy has been missing for two days, but the article states that he has been missing for one day.
5. The summary does not mention the involvement of the FBI and Virginia State Police, which is a significant detail in the article.
6. The summary does not mention the search dogs stopping near the road near Noah's house, which is a unique detail in the article.
7. The summary does not mention the possibility of Noah falling into a nearby pond, which is mentioned in the article.
8. The summary does not mention the parents' statement being delayed, which is a detail in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article. It is missing many crucial details and includes some inaccuracies.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Noah Thomas' mother last saw him at 9 am and that the search has widened since he first went missing.
2. However, the article states that Noah's mother last saw him at 9 am, went back to bed, and couldn't find him when she woke up around 10 am or 10:30 am. The article doesn't specify the exact time when Noah went missing.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the search has widened since he first went missing, but the article doesn't provide information on when the search was initiated or widened.
