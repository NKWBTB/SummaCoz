     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the man was struggling to use his hands, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article states that the man was able to get to his feet and run away with his hands tied behind his back.
2. The summary states that the man was lying next to police officers, but the article does not mention this. The article states that the man was handcuffed outside a bar and that four police officers were nearby, trying to detain two other men.
3. The summary states that the man made a bid for freedom, but the article does not use this language. Instead, the article states that the man "managed to get to his feet" and "ran out of shot."
4. The summary states that the police officer spotted the man bolting and gave chase, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that the police officer made to give chase after the man had already run away.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes details that are not present in the article and omits other important details that are present in the article.
