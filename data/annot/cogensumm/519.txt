Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

Based on the provided article and summary, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested last November."
2. The summary states that "seven games involving Nimes were investigated."
3. However, the article does not mention that the games were investigated before Conrad was arrested. Instead, it states that the investigation followed his arrest.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the chronology of events. The article indicates that the investigation began after Conrad's arrest, not before.
5. As a result, the summary is not a correct summary of the article's content. It does not provide an accurate overview of the information presented in the article.
