    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was investigated. However, the article states that seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested, which is a different timeline.
2. The summary implies that the investigation was conducted after Conrad was investigated, but the article states that the investigation followed Conrad's arrest last November.
3. The summary mentions that Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season, but the article does not mention anything about relegation. Instead, it states that Nimes will be demoted to the third division as a result of the match-fixing scandal.
4. The summary mentions that Caen president Jean-Francois Fortin and Conrad have been charged with corruption, but the article does not mention anything about charges against Fortin.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions. The timeline, details of the investigation, and the consequences for Nimes are not accurately represented in the summary.
