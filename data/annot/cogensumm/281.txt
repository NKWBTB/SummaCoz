    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Roberto Mancini turned up the heat on Manuel Pellegrini's successor, but the article does not mention anything about Mancini's successor. Instead, the article focuses on Pellegrini's performance as the current manager of Manchester City.
2. The summary claims that Mancini thinks Pellegrini should be winning a trophy every year, but the article does not quote Mancini as saying this. Instead, the article states that Mancini thinks City can win a title every year and has a chance to put in more good players.
3. The summary states that Pellegrini is under heavy pressure with City faltering in their Barclays Premier League title defence and facing an uphill task against Barcelona in the Champions League, but the article does not mention anything about Pellegrini being under pressure. Instead, the article states that Pellegrini is facing a tough task against Barcelona in the Champions League.
4. The summary claims that Mancini was sacked by City in 2013 despite winning the Premier League title the previous year, but the article does not mention anything about Mancini being sacked. Instead, the article states that Mancini guided Manchester City to the Premier League title in 2012 after FA Cup success in 2011.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that Mancini turned up the heat on Pellegrini's successor, but there is no mention of this in the article. Additionally, the summary claims that Pellegrini is under heavy pressure, but the article does not support this claim.
