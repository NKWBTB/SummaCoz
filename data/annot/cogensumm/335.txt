A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed the creature's incredible tongue acrobatics. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill. To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds. Scroll down for video . A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket . The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes. This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed. Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius. Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. Lifespan: Two to five years . Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth. The tongue’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself. In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion. The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved. Previous studies didn’t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said. When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics. The Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds . The tongue’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup dragging it in .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the panther shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds.
2. However, the article states that the panther chameleon attacks its prey with its tongue, but it does not mention the tongue being shot out.
3. The article explains that the chameleon's tongue is powered by a bone in the base of the tongue, special tissue that acts as a spring, and powerful muscles.
4. The article also mentions that the tongue reaches around 41G, which is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately describe the chameleon's tongue acrobatics and instead implies that the panther shoots out its tongue, which is not mentioned in the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the panther shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds.
2. But the fact in article is the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds.
3. The chameleon is the key word in the sentence mentioned in article but the summary missed it, thus it is inconsistent with article.
