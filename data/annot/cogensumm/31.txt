</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat for Manuel Pellegrini's successor, implying that Mancini is calling for Pellegrini to be replaced.
2. However, the article states that Mancini believes Pellegrini was "really lucky" to inherit a strong team from him and should be delivering continual success at the Etihad Stadium. This suggests that Mancini is not calling for Pellegrini's replacement, but rather challenging him to perform better with the team he inherited.
3. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it implies that Mancini is seeking to replace Pellegrini, while the article states that Mancini is challenging Pellegrini to perform better.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the reason for this inconsistency is that the summary misinterpreted Mancini's statements as a call for Pellegrini's replacement, rather than a challenge for him to perform better.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions roberto mancini has turned up the heat for manuel pellegrini's successor.
2. But the fact in article is that manuel pellegrini is roberto mancini's successor.
3. As the summary mess up the relations between people, it is inconsistent with article.
