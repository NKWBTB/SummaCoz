    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Ayew has netted six during the Africa Cup of Nations.
2. However, the article states that Ayew scored three goals for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations.
3. This means that the information in the summary is not consistent with the article, as the number of goals scored by Ayew during the Africa Cup of Nations is incorrect.
4. The article states that Ayew has managed six all season for Marseille, which is a different number from the three goals he scored during the Africa Cup of Nations.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it provides incorrect information about Ayew's goalscoring record during the Africa Cup of Nations.
