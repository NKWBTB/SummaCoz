Kai Hibbard worked on her book 'Too Fat, Too Thin, Can't Win' with Deborah Baer, according to the New York Daily News. Hibbard's book will reportedly detail what happens behind the scenes of 'The Biggest Loser,' which has aired for 16 seasons. Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season. Speaking out: Kai Hibbard (seen left and right) has reportedly penned an expose on'The Biggest Loser.' Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season . A source in the book industry told the Daily News 'The show didn't invent fat-shaming, but exploits it. Her proposal was so juicy. It has a bigger, more important message about weight and health.' According to the newspaper, Hibbard's book claims that 'The Biggest Loser' refused to purchase new underwear for contestants, whose underwear drooped as the pounds came off. The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct. I hope more than a "tell all" that when all is said and done it stands as a statement on the media, society and how shame is not a motivator but a paralytic from someone who has regretfully been there and done that.' Remarks: Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster' Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment. She recently told the New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in.' She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, "You’re going die before your children grow up." "You’re going to die, just like your mother." "We’ve picked out your fat-person coffin" - that was in a text message. One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised. The consistent "Biggest Loser" health transformations of over 300 contestants through 16 seasons of the program speak for themselves.' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Title: The title of the summary is "Kai Hibbard worked on her book 'too fat' with Deborah Baer," which implies that Hibbard and Baer collaborated on a book about being overweight. However, the article states that Hibbard's book is actually an expose on "The Biggest Loser" and does not focus specifically on her own weight or experiences.
2. Book content: The summary mentions that Hibbard worked on a book called "Too Fat, Too Thin, Can't Win" with Deborah Baer, but the article does not provide any information about the content of the book. Instead, it focuses on the allegations made in the book about "The Biggest Loser" and its treatment of contestants.
3. Fat-shaming: The summary does not mention the allegations of fat-shaming made in the article, nor does it mention any of the specific examples of alleged mistreatment of contestants by the show's trainers.
4. Tone: The tone of the summary is neutral and factual, while the tone of the article is more sensational and critical of "The Biggest Loser" and its treatment of contestants.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content or tone of the article. It provides only a brief, factual statement about Hibbard's book and does not include any of the more sensational or controversial information presented in the article.
