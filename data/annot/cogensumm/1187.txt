    The Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, where an 'Easter Hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Much like Father Christmas, the brown-coloured animals was often depicted carrying a selection of treats to good children's houses. But while the traditional version of the rabbit was a natural-looking creature, the modern character has become an often terrifying white, pink, purple and yellow creation. The Easter bunny is meant to be a joyful character, but often botched costumes mean they are more horrific than happy, as this picture demonstrates . The symbol of the Easter often results in a terrifying sight when produced on a budget. Children who would usually be delighted to be meeting someone who will be gifting them with chocolate eggs end up screaming for their parents. As reported by Metro, unfortunate humans who have been given the task of dressing up as the rabbit end up looking more like the terrifying Donnie Darko character than a friendly furball.

     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the modern version of the Easter bunny is "terrifying," while the article describes the character as "often terrifying" and "creepy." The summary presents the bunny as a universally frightening figure, while the article acknowledges that the character can be both joyful and terrifying depending on the context.
2. The summary mentions that the Easter bunny is "white, pink, purple and yellow," while the article only mentions these colors as being part of the "modern" version of the character. The summary implies that these colors are a defining feature of the Easter bunny, while the article portrays them as an optional aspect.
3. The summary states that the Easter bunny "often results in a terrifying sight," while the article emphasizes that the character can be both joyful and terrifying. The summary presents the bunny as a consistently frightening figure, while the article acknowledges that the character can be both positive and negative.
4. The summary mentions "treats" as a key aspect of the Easter bunny's role, while the article focuses more on the character's appearance and demeanor. The summary implies that the bunny's primary function is to distribute treats, while the article portrays this as a secondary aspect of the character's role.

Overall, the summary presents a more negative and consistent portrayal of the Easter bunny, while the article provides a more nuanced and varied portrayal of the character. The summary is not consistent with the article because it oversimplifies and exaggerates the character's negative aspects, while downplaying the positive aspects mentioned in the article.
