Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Jenson Button was happy to be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix.
2. However, the article states that Button and Alonso failed to finish the race, and Button was forced to retire after 42 laps.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary is not consistent with the information in the article, as Button did not finish the race and cannot be considered competitive.
4. The article does mention that Button was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely Australian Grand Prix, but this is not mentioned in the summary.
5. The summary only focuses on Button's happiness, which is not supported by the information in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement should be revised to accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
