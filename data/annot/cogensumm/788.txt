    Article: 
    Arsenal and Manchester City are tracking Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu. The Turkey international has impressed since joining from Hamburg in the summer, scoring five times in Leverkusen's bid to qualify for the Champions League. And his displays have captured the attention of both City and Arsenal in recent months. Arsenal and Manchester City are keen on Bayer Leverkusen star Hakan Calhanoglu, pictured here in action earlier this month against FC Kaiserslautern in the German Cup quarter final . The Gunners have been on the 21-year-old's case since last season, but City are also paying close attention to his displays having impressed Etihad Stadium scouts in recent months. Calhanoglu's ability from dead ball situations have particularly caught the eye of City and Arsenal scouts. Calhanoglu has impressed at Leverkusen this season following his arrival from Hamburg last summer . Manchester City and Arsenal both have scouts monitoring the 21-year-old dead ball specialist's progress . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Arsenal and Manchester City are tracking Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu.
2. The article does not mention anything about Manchester City tracking Calhanoglu.
3. The article states that Arsenal has been on Calhanoglu's case since last season, but there is no mention of Manchester City paying close attention to his displays.
4. The article mentions that Calhanoglu has impressed at Leverkusen this season following his arrival from Hamburg last summer, but there is no mention of him being a dead ball specialist.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it includes information about Manchester City tracking Calhanoglu, which is not supported by the article. Additionally, the summary mentions Calhanoglu being a dead ball specialist, which is not mentioned in the article.
