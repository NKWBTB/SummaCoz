Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Arsenal and Manchester City have been paying close attention to Hakan Calhanoglu's displays in recent months.
2. The summary claims that Arsenal have been on the 21-year-old's case since last season.
3. The article does not mention anything about Arsenal being interested in Calhanoglu before last season. In fact, it states that Arsenal and Manchester City have only been paying close attention to his displays in recent months.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Arsenal have been interested in Calhanoglu for a longer period of time than the article suggests.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it implies that Arsenal have been interested in Calhanoglu for an entire season before the article's timeframe of "recent months".
