    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Arsenal has been on the 21-year-old's case since last season.
2. However, the article states that Arsenal has been monitoring the player since last season, but it does not mention that they have been on his case since last season.
3. The phrase "on his case" implies a more intense and persistent interest, which is not reflected in the article.
4. The article mentions that both Arsenal and Manchester City are interested in the player, but it does not mention that Arsenal has been pursuing him for a longer period of time.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies a more advanced stage of interest from Arsenal than what is stated in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the intensity and duration of Arsenal's interest in the player.
