    Summary: 
    the american hunt is a chase - the intent is not to. 

    Article: 
    A hound's howl breaks through the cold rainfall. Dozens more hounds emerge from a stand of trees and bound across a field in search of a fox's scent. Horses carrying riders in red and black coats follow from a ways behind, quickly disappearing again over a hillcrest, minutes away from Baltimore's growing suburbs. The Elkridge-Harford Hunt Club has roots dating back to 1878, but records show organized foxhunts took place in Maryland as early as the 1790s. In order to preserve a pastime that requires vast open space in the midst of one of the world's densest regions, the club has managed to protect a patchwork of land that is larger than Manhattan. According to the website of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, there are nearly 160 organized foxhunting clubs in the U.S. and Canada. And while the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns 10 years ago is still debated, the American hunt is a chase - the intent is not to kill a fox. In many places red foxes are a rarity in the US so the hounds chase coyotes - a distant cousin of the fox - instead. But from dress to decorum, many of the traditions remain unaltered from its inception.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the American hunt is a chase, but the article states that the intent is not to kill a fox.

The article explains that the American hunt is a chase, but the intent is not to kill a fox. Instead, the hunt is designed to follow the fox's scent and test the hounds' skills. The summary omits this important detail and simply states that the American hunt is a chase, which could be interpreted as implying that the intent is to kill the fox.

2. The summary states that the hunt is to chase coyotes, but the article does not mention coyotes.

The article does not mention coyotes at all. It only mentions foxes and how the hunt is designed to follow their scent. The mention of coyotes in the summary is therefore not supported by the article.

3. The summary implies that the hunt is primarily about killing the fox, but the article emphasizes that the intent is not to kill.

The article emphasizes that the intent of the hunt is not to kill the fox, but rather to follow its scent and test the hounds' skills. The summary does not convey this important detail and instead implies that the primary goal of the hunt is to kill the fox.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important details, adds information that is not supported by the article, and implies that the primary goal of the hunt is to kill the fox, which is not the case.
