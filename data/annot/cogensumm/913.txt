    Article: 
    (CNN)A lot of people have ventured to Paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream. My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: "What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?" And "Where is Paraguay, anyway?" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for "The Missing Bourdain" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film "The Limey" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's "Parts Unknown" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: The summary states that Paraguay is known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis, but the article does not mention this.

The article mentions that Paraguay is a country few of us know much about, and that it has been plagued by crime, corruption, and failed institutions, but it does not mention anything about escaped Nazis.

Step 2: The summary states that Jean Bourdain died in Asuncion, Paraguay, but the article does not confirm this.

The article mentions that the author's great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of the people who ventured to Paraguay in search of a dream, but it does not provide any information about his death or where he died.

Step 3: The summary implies that the author's family has a connection to Paraguay, but the article does not provide any evidence of this.

The article mentions that the author has been searching for information about his great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, but it does not provide any information about his family having a connection to Paraguay.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, such as Paraguay being a hideout for escaped Nazis, and it implies a connection between the author's family and Paraguay that is not supported by the text.
