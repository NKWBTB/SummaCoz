    Summary: 
    charles is said to have become increasingly increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role. 

    Article: 
    The Prince of Wales described becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life', pictured at George's christening in 2013 . Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as ‘a unique moment in anyone’s life’. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne’s frustrations is the so-called ‘Middletonisation’ of his son William’s life — specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole’s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called ‘March of the Middletons’ that he has complained to friends: ‘They never let me see my grandson.’ Adds a source: ‘Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole.’ It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it’s a deliberate move on William’s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles’s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate’s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot’s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William’s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify the inconsistencies in the summary.

Step 1: Identify the main points of the article.

The article discusses Prince Charles's frustration with the "Middletonization" of his son Prince William's life, specifically the amount of time William spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole Middleton. The article also mentions that Charles has complained to friends that he never gets to see his grandson, Prince George.

Step 2: Identify the inconsistencies in the summary.

The summary states that Charles is "perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince's life." However, the article states that Charles is frustrated with the amount of time William spends with his in-laws, which suggests that Charles is not just perplexed but also upset about the situation.

Step 3: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies.

The inconsistency in the summary likely stemmed from a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the article's content. The summary focuses on Charles's perceived peripheral role in George's life, while the article emphasizes Charles's frustration with the amount of time William spends with the Middletons.

Step 4: Provide evidence from the article to support the inconsistencies.

The article provides evidence that Charles is frustrated with the amount of time William spends with the Middletons, such as the statement "Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she’s Queen Carole." This evidence contradicts the summary's claim that Charles is only perplexed about his peripheral role in George's life.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misinterprets Charles's feelings towards his grandson and the amount of time William spends with the Middletons. The article provides evidence that Charles is frustrated with the Middleton's influence in William's life, rather than just being perplexed about his own role.

###Corrected:
1. The summary mentions charles is said to have become increasingly increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role. But the fact in article is Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince’s life.
2. The increasingly is repeated twice in summary which is inconsistent with original sentence in article.
3. Without the content 'he occupies in the young Prince’s life', the reader could have missunderstanding of the summary because the two sentences in summary and article may have different meanings which also is inconsistent.
