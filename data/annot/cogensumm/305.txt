(CNN)The health of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in hospital with pneumonia since February 5, has deteriorated further, the government said Wednesday. The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. "Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further," the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. "We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image," Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004. The elder Lee has been credited with Singapore's remarkable transformation from a colonial trading post to a prosperous financial center. However, he has also been a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the top government says Singapore's founding father has died.
2. However, the article does not mention the death of Lee Kuan Yew. Instead, it reports that he remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further.
3. The article also mentions that a hoax report about Lee's supposed demise had circulated online, and that the government has reported this to the police for investigation.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of Lee's death in the article. Instead, the article focuses on his critical illness and the hoax report about his death.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states that the top government says Singapore's founding father has died.
2. However, the article does not mention the death of Lee Kuan Yew. Instead, it reports that he remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further.
3. The article points out it is a hoax that Singapore's founding father had died.
4. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
