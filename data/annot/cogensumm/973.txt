She looked like she was a tiny little thing - I can't believe this has happened. 'This is really horrible - we can't imagine what the family must be going through.' She said police had been outside the home in Dundee all weekend. A police van  was outside the home in Dundee all weekend and friends left flowers and tributes at the gate .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the police have launched a probe into the "tragic death" of Sophia Walker. However, the article states that the death is being treated as "unexplained" and not "tragic."
2. The summary mentions that Sophia was born premature in late December, but the article does not provide this information.
3. The summary states that the mother, Patricia Hodgdon, wrote a series of messages on Facebook, but the article does not mention this.
4. The summary mentions that friends and relatives were comforting the parents, but the article does not mention this.
5. The summary states that a police van was outside the home all weekend, but the article does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
