    A married couple and their friend have been killed in a car accident while on a 'trip of a lifetime' in New Zealand. Mitchell and Ruth Peterson, who had five children together, and grandmother Tammy Barnett from Richfield, Utah, were in an SUV when they turned into into the path of the truck outside the North Island city of Hamilton on Tuesday. Mrs Barnett's husband, Richard, was injured in the crash and was in a stable condition in Waikato Hospital on Thursday afternoon. The members of the Latter-Day Saints Church were visiting the branch in Hamilton, the New Zealand Herald reported. Tammy Barnett from Richfield, Utah, was killed when an SUV overturned near the city of Hamilton, in New Zealand, during a 'trip of a lifetime'. Her husband Richard (pictured) was injured in the crash and was in a stable condition in hospital on Thursday .

Mr Barnett, who is an orthodontist in the town, and his late wife, have four children and four grandchildren together. Mr Peterson was a LDS in his ward and ran a visitor center. Richfield Mayor David Ogden told theÂ Desert News: 'The whole valley has been affected by this. We all know them. They are so important in our lives, and so we are going to rally around the families.' A GoFundMe page set up in a bid to cover Mr Barnett's medical and Mrs Barnett's funeral costs read: Our dearest wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, grandmother and friend Tammy tragically left us while on the trip of a lifetime to New Zealand with her beloved husband Richard. 'Tammy had an incredible energy about her and will be sorely missed. We have the unique opportunity to make this time a little easier to bear.

Mitch and Ruth leave five beautiful children to take on the responsibility of funeral costs.

3. The summary states that the members of the Latter-Day Saints Church were visiting the branch in Hamilton, but the article does not mention this.
