    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistent information

The inconsistent information is:

* "Pellegrini has come under fire for City faltering title defence." (Summary)
* "Mancini lost his job at City in 2013 after his team's failed title defence and poor European showing." (Article)

Step 2: Analyze the reason for the inconsistency

The reason for the inconsistency is that the summary states that Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defence, but the article states that Mancini lost his job at City in 2013 after his team's failed title defence. This implies that Pellegrini has not yet come under fire for City's title defence, as he has only been in the job for two seasons and has already won two trophies.

Step 3: Determine which information is correct

The correct information is:

* "Mancini lost his job at City in 2013 after his team's failed title defence and poor European showing." (Article)

Step 4: Explain the inconsistency

The inconsistency arises from the fact that the summary is referring to Pellegrini's current situation, while the article is referring to Mancini's past situation. Pellegrini has only been in the job for two seasons, and has not yet come under fire for City's title defence, as the article states. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defence is not consistent with the article.
