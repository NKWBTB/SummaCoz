Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat on successor Manuel Pellegrini by claiming the Chilean should be winning a trophy every year. Mancini thinks Pellegrini was 'really lucky' to inherit a strong side from him and he should be delivering continual success at the Etihad Stadium.

'I think City can win a title every year and have a chance - it should and must try to win a title every year.'

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure to save Manchester City's season.

This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Pellegrini is under pressure to save his job, not the season.

2. The summary states that Mancini thinks Pellegrini was "really lucky" to inherit a strong side.

This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention Mancini's opinion on Pellegrini's luck.

3. The summary states that Manchester City will look to overturn a 201 deficit against Barcelona.

This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that City will look to overturn a 201 first-leg deficit against Barcelona, not a 201 deficit.

4. The summary states that Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defence.

This is consistent with the article, as the article states that Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defence and Champions League campaign.

5. The summary states that Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat for Manuel Pellegrini's successor.

This is consistent with the article, as the article states that Mancini has turned up the heat on Pellegrini by claiming that the Chilean should be winning a trophy every year.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misstates the pressure on Pellegrini, misquotes Mancini's opinion, and misstates the score against Barcelona.

###Corrected:
1. The summary implies that Manuel Pellegrini is currently under pressure to save Manchester City's season, and Roberto Mancini thinks Pellegrini was "really lucky" to inherit a strong side. It also mentions that Manchester City will look to overturn a 201 deficit against Barcelona, and Pellegrini has come under fire for City's faltering title defense. Finally, it states that Roberto Mancini has turned up the heat for Manuel Pellegrini's successor.
2. However, the article states that Manuel Pellegrini did win two trophies last season, contradicting the implication that he has been entirely unsuccessful. Additionally, while Mancini criticizes Pellegrini, the article does not explicitly mention that Pellegrini is currently under pressure or facing criticism for the ongoing season. The summary suggests a sense of urgency and criticism that may not be entirely supported by the article.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies current pressure on Pellegrini and criticism for the ongoing season, while the article focuses more on Mancini's comments about Pellegrini being lucky, without explicitly stating that Pellegrini is currently under intense pressure or criticism.
