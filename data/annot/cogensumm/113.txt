VIDEO: Scroll down to watch sickening alleged punch that knocks out Oldham youngster . Jack Touhy is struck from behind in the head, apparently with no provocation, by an opponenent . The Oldham youth player is knocked from his feet by the force of Sam Livesey's alleged punch . A red card for violent conduct would normally carry a three-match ban but officials believe such a punishment may be too lenient and have stepped in. A spokesman for the FA said: 'The charge is an allegation that Mr Livesey's behaviour in or around the 71st minute constitutes violent conduct in circumstances where the standard punishment that would otherwise apply following his dismissal is clearly insufficient.' It is understood that Livesey, on loan to Morecambe from Preston North End, has admitted the charge. His case will now be heard by an Independent Regulatory Commission. Livesey has now been charged with violent conduct by the FA and is understood to have admitted the charge . Tuohy spent four hours at hospital after the game after complaining of concussion-like symptoms . Morecambe say they are dealing with the matter internally. A spokesman for Preston North End said: 'At the time of the incident, Sam Livesey was playing for Morecambe and we therefore have no comment to make.' Tuohy spent four hours at hospital after the game after complaining of concussion-like symptoms. After the game he tweeted: 'Good 7-2 win good to get a goal and head is killing me now wow.' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can help you identify the inconsistency in the summary and the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Read the summary.

The summary states that Sam Livesey, an 18-year-old footballer, was captured on a clip punching an opponent, Jack Tuohy, in the temple.

Step 2: Read the article.

The article states that Sam Livesey has been charged by the Football Association (FA) for allegedly punching Jack Tuohy in the head during a match. The article also mentions that Tuohy spent four hours in the hospital after the game due to concussion-like symptoms.

Step 3: Identify the inconsistency.

The inconsistency is that the summary states that Livesey punched Tuohy in the temple, while the article states that he punched Tuohy in the head. The article provides a video clip that shows Livesey punching Tuohy from behind, which is not consistent with the summary's description of a punch to the temple.

Step 4: Explain the inconsistency.

The inconsistency is likely due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the video clip. The video clip shows Livesey punching Tuohy from behind, which is not a punch to the temple as described in the summary. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

###Corrected:
1. The summary states sam livesey, 18, was captured on a clip of oldham's jack tuohy. But the truth in article is Sam Livesey, 18, was captured on a clip obtained by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy in the temple, it was capture by Sportsmail not the oldham's jack tuohy.
