     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the man was arrested outside a bar in Austin, Texas, but the article does not mention any arrest. Instead, the article describes the man making a bid for freedom after being handcuffed and lying on the floor.
2. The summary states that the man was handcuffed and lying on the floor, but the article does not mention any handcuffs. The man is described as being restrained with a black bag looped around his arms.
3. The summary states that the man struggled to his feet and ran away, but the article does not mention him running away. Instead, the article describes the man stumbling to his knees and the police officers remaining oblivious to his escape.
4. The summary states that the man was later charged with evading arrest, but the article does not mention any charges. Instead, the article states that the police officers were busy trying to detain two other men.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it exaggerates the man's actions and adds details that are not present in the article. The article portrays the man as making a failed bid for freedom, while the summary portrays him as successfully escaping arrest.
