    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Roma and Tottenham have asked to be kept informed about Andre Ayew's status, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that Tottenham and Everton have asked to be kept informed, but does not include Roma.
2. The summary states that Andre Ayew has netted six during the Africa Cup of Nations, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that Ayew scored three goals for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations.
3. The summary states that Newcastle have made an initial approach for Andre Ayew, but the article does not mention this. The article only states that Newcastle have expressed interest in signing Ayew.
4. The summary states that Moussa Konate is wanted by several top sides, including Tottenham, Everton, and Roma, but the article does not mention this. The article only mentions that Newcastle have also expressed interest in signing Konate.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
