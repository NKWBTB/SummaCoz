    Article: 
    Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. Tielemans, 17, has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal also and is a centre midfielder of some promise. He became the youngest Belgian player to play in the UEFA Champions League, making his Champions League debut at the age of 16 years, four months and 25 days in 2013. Chelsea are keen on signing Anderlecht teenagerÂ Youri Tielemans (pictured on the left) Leander Dendoncker is also said to be on Chelsea's radar after impressing for Anderlecht in recent weeks . Dendoncker, 19, is a more defensive player and can operate in midfield or at centre back. He scored Anderlecht's second goal in a feisty 2-0 win over Kortrijk on Sunday which saw both sides reduced to 10 men while Tielemans was one of four players booked. Belgium newspaper HLN reported that Chelsea scout Tony White was in the crowd to watch the game. Meanwhile, Chelsea have extended contracts for 18-year-old Belgian Charly Musonda Jnr to 2019 and his elder brother Tika Musonda until 2016. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

Step 1: Identify the statements in the summary that are not consistent with the article.

The summary states that Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker. This is consistent with the article.

However, the summary also states that tielemans has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal, which is not consistent with the article. The article only mentions that Manchester United and Arsenal have watched Tielemans, but does not mention any interest from these clubs in Dendoncker.

Step 2: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistency.

The inconsistency in the summary likely arises from the fact that the article only mentions Tielemans being watched by Manchester United and Arsenal, but the summary includes Dendoncker as well. Additionally, the summary states that Tielemans is a centre midfielder, which is not mentioned in the article.

Step 3: Identify any additional information in the article that could help to clarify the inconsistency.

The article provides additional information that Tielemans became the youngest Belgian player to play in the UEFA Champions League, and that Chelsea are keen on signing him. This information is not included in the summary.

Step 4: Evaluate the impact of the inconsistency on the summary's overall accuracy and reliability.

The inconsistency in the summary reduces its overall accuracy and reliability, as it presents information that is not supported by the article. This could potentially mislead readers who rely on the summary for information about Chelsea's transfer plans.

Therefore, it is important to carefully review and fact-check summaries to ensure that they accurately reflect the information presented in the original article.
