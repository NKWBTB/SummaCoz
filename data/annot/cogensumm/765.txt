Tielemans, 17, has been watched by Manchester United and Arsenal also and is a centre midfielder of some promise.

He scored Anderlecht's second goal in a feisty 2-0 win over Kortrijk on Sunday which saw both sides reduced to 10 men while Tielemans was one of four players booked. Belgium newspaper HLN reported that Chelsea scout Tony White was in the crowd to watch the game.

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Chelsea are maintaining a watching brief on Anderlecht teenagers Youri Tielemans and Leander Dendoncker.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Chelsea maintaining a watching brief on Leander Dendoncker. It only mentions that Chelsea are keen on signing Youri Tielemans and that Tony White, a Chelsea scout, was in the crowd to watch Tielemans play.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions Leander Dendoncker as someone Chelsea are watching, but the article does not support this claim.
4. The summary also states that Tielemans became the youngest Belgian player to play in the UEFA Champions League, which is correct according to the article.
5. However, the summary does not mention that Tielemans was booked in the game, which is mentioned in the article.
6. Overall, the summary is not a complete and accurate representation of the information in the article. It contains some correct information, but also includes some inaccuracies and omissions.
