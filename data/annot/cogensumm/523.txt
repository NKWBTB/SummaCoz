Undeterred by the fact that he was unable to use his hands and lying next to several police officers, the man struggles to his feet while they are tackling two people nearby and sprints off through a watching crowd. The footage begins with the man, dressed in red shorts and a grey T-shirt, lying handcuffed outside a pub called the Blind Tiger Pub on Sixth Street.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the man was arrested outside a bar in Austin, Texas, after being arrested. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that the man was handcuffed and lying on the floor, not that he was arrested.
2. The summary does not provide any information about the man's attempt to escape or the events that unfolded after he struggled to his feet. The article, on the other hand, provides a detailed account of the man's bid for freedom and the police officers' attempts to detain him.
3. The summary does not mention the festival or the fact that the man was arrested during the SXSW festival. The article, however, mentions that the incident took place during the SXSW festival and provides context about the festival and the events that took place.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide accurate information about the man's attempt to escape and the events that unfolded. The summary is too brief and lacks important details, making it inconsistent with the article.
