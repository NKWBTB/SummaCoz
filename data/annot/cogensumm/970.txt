    Article: 
    Draft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate threatens to reduce Iranian women to 'baby-making machines' and set their rights back by decades, Amnesty International warned on Wednesday. The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the draft legislation would restrict access to contraception, but the article does not mention anything about contraception being restricted. Instead, the article states that the draft legislation would ban voluntary sterilization and end state subsidies for contraceptive services.
2. The summary claims that the legislation would force women into unsafe backstreet abortions, but the article does not support this claim. In fact, the article states that the draft legislation would make abortion even more difficult to access, as it would be illegal except in very limited circumstances.
3. The summary states that the legislation would close many jobs to women who choose not to have children, but the article does not mention anything about this. Instead, the article states that the draft legislation would prioritize hiring men and women with children for certain jobs.
4. The summary suggests that the legislation would reduce Iranian women to "baby-making machines," but the article does not support this characterization. The article quotes an Amnesty International official as saying that the proposed laws would "entrench discriminatory practices" and "set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades," but it does not use the phrase "baby-making machines."

Overall, the summary takes some liberties with the information presented in the article and exaggerates the potential impact of the draft legislation on Iranian women.
