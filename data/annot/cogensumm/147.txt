    It's known that the following summary is not consistent with the article. 
    Find out why.

    Summary: 
    migrants who come to britain to live or work must prove they have committed a crime. 

    Article: 
    Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders. Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK, the Mail can reveal. Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Tighter measures: Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade. This would disclose whether they had a clean criminal record or had committed offences. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘This power will enable us to require those applying for a visa to provide a criminal record certificate covering the last ten years – an additional tool to help stop criminals from coming to our country.’ Some 1.9million people arriving on visitor visas, or those from 56 countries and territories which do not need visas, will not need to provide their criminal histories because this would be ‘disproportionate’ in terms of time, cost and bureaucracy. The system will also exempt under-18s, asylum seekers and those people where it is not ‘reasonably practicable’. Tougher stance: Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK . 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that migrants must provide a criminal records certificate from their home country to prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years.
2. However, the summary states that migrants must prove they have committed a crime.
3. These two statements are contradictory, as one states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime, while the other states that they must prove they have committed a crime.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly states that migrants must prove they have committed a crime, when in fact, the article states that they must prove they have not committed a crime.
