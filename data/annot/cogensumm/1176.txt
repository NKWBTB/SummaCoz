    Article: 
    Paul Lambert has only 'good things' to say about Aston Villa, the club he left last month after a disappointing run of games. The 45-year-old replaced Alex McLeish at the helm of the Premier League club in June 2012 but following a poor run of results, which left Villa in the bottom three, the club parted company with the Scot and later appointed Tim Sherwood as his successor. He told BBC's Football Focus: 'I don't have any bad things about Aston Villa. It's a brilliant football club as everybody knows. Paul Lambert says he only has 'good things' to say about Aston Villa despite his sacking in Feburary . Lambert believes Villa are in a healthier position than when he arrived, particularly in terms of their finances . 'I came in at really, probably a tough time and obviously when the financial reports came out, their losses are way down now so from that point of view the club is in probably a lot healthier position than when I went there. 'It's a great club with great people at it, and great people left behind. 'There's things when you look back and think "maybe I should have done that better or different" but I've got nothing but good things (to say) about the club.' Since leaving Villa, Lambert has spent time in Germany with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund working towards his UEFA Pro Licence. Lambert has spent time with Borussia Dortmund and Jurgen Klopp working towards his UEFA Pro Licence . Pep Guardiola is another manager in Germany that Lambert has been able to observe at close quarters of late . Although he enjoyed his time overseas and said his time spent there 'was a great experience', Lambert admitted he had no real plans to take up a managerial role abroad at this moment in time and follow the likes of former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes, who is head coach at Real Sociedad. When asked if he fancied managing overseas right now, the former Dortmund midfielder replied: 'Not really, I went over there - I've been back in the country for over a week or so now. 'The two clubs (Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich) there I know very well. Germany's been a big part of my life there but spending that time at Dortmund was a great experience and you learn so much, even though you're only there for that week or so to watch them....it was a great, great experience.' Lambert said he had no desire to followÂ Real Sociedad head coach David Moyes in managing abroad . Lambert praised the work of Klopp and said that working with his Borussia Dortmund side was eye-opening . Sitting and talking with Guardiola was said to be a great experience for the former Aston Villa manager . Lambert praised the work Jurgen Klopp has done at the German club and admitted working and talking with the Dortmund coach and Bayern's Pep Guardiola was eye-opening. He added: '(Guardiola) and Jurgen Klopp are probably the best I've seen working. Just the way they can get the best out of people. 'I think meeting with him (Klopp) and Pep Guardiola was a great experience, to sit with them and talk to them. Defeat by Hull saw Lambert's Villa move into the relegation zone and he was subsequently sacked . Villa have improved under new manager Tim Sherwood but are still not too far off the Premier League drop . 'With Jurgen, I knew Jurgen from the Pro Licence, but to spend nine days with him was excellent. What you see on TV is what he's like as a guy....eccentric probably. He's a top, top guy and they way you see Borussia Dortmund now is probably due to him.' Lambert, who made 44 appearances playing for Dormund from 1996-1997 and helped them win the Champions League, said: 'Even though I'd played there - that was a massive football club - when I went back and watched them it's exploded really, really quickly and Jurgen has been a catalyst of what's happened.'

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Identify the inconsistencies

The summary states that Paul Lambert only has good things to say about Aston Villa, despite being sacked by the club in February. However, the article states that Lambert was sacked by Villa in February and replaced by Tim Sherwood. This inconsistency indicates that the summary is not accurate.

Step 2: Analyze the reasons for the inconsistencies

The inconsistency in the summary may be due to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the article. The article states that Lambert was sacked by Villa, but the summary implies that he only has positive things to say about the club. Additionally, the article mentions that Lambert spent time in Germany with Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, but the summary does not mention this.

Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the inconsistencies

The inconsistencies in the summary may have a negative impact on the reader's understanding of the article. The reader may be left with the impression that Lambert only has positive things to say about Aston Villa, which is not accurate. Additionally, the omission of the fact that Lambert spent time in Germany may lead the reader to believe that he has not learned anything from his experience abroad.

Step 4: Provide recommendations for improvement

To improve the consistency of the summary, the following changes could be made:

* Correctly state that Lambert was sacked by Aston Villa in February.
* Include the fact that Lambert spent time in Germany with Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.
* Provide more specific details about Lambert's experience in Germany, such as what he learned from observing Klopp and Guardiola.

By making these changes, the summary can be improved to better reflect the accuracy and detail of the article.
