This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel. CCTV footage shows the 65-year-old motorist, who has not been named, slowly drifting off while he navigates a road in Oakland County, Michigan. After stirring he suddenly slams on the brakes, but it proves too late and he collides with a car in front. The driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through. In a bid to avoid further damage, the driver is seen steering the bus into the hard shoulder. A loud scraping noise can be heard as the vehicle drags a trail of debris along. A number of other vehicles are bumped and scratched as the bus goes by. After the driver manages to stop, a woman who was sat in the middle of the coach, exits out of the front door. There were apparently no other passengers on board. Caught on camera: This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the driver "slowly drifts off" while the article states that the driver "falls asleep". The word "drifts" implies a gradual loss of consciousness, while "falls asleep" implies a more sudden and complete loss of consciousness.
2. The summary states that the driver "slams on the brakes" but it "proves too late", while the article states that the driver "suddenly slams on the brakes" but collides with the car in front. The word "suddenly" is missing in the summary, which implies that the braking was not as sudden as described in the article.
3. The summary states that the "driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through", while the article states that "the driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through the bus". The word "bus" is missing in the summary, which implies that the windscreen only shattered and fell through, without specifying what it fell through.
4. The summary states that the driver "steers the bus into the hard shoulder", while the article states that the driver "tries to steer the bus into the hard shoulder". The word "tries" is missing in the summary, which implies that the driver successfully steered the bus into the hard shoulder, which is not the case according to the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits or modifies several key details, which results in a different narrative of the events.
