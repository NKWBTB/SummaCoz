     Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the driver "slowly drifts off," but the article states that the driver "slowly drifts off while he navigates a road." This difference in wording suggests that the summary may have oversimplified or misinterpreted the article's information.

2. The summary claims that the driver "suddenly slams on the brakes," but the article states that the driver "suddenly slams on the brakes, but it proves too late." This difference in wording suggests that the summary may have exaggerated the driver's actions.

3. The summary states that the driver's side of the windscreen "immediately shatters and falls through," but the article states that the driver's side of the windscreen "immediately shatters and falls through, but the driver is seen steering the bus into the hard shoulder." This difference in wording suggests that the summary may have missed or misinterpreted the article's information about the driver's actions.

4. The summary claims that "a number of other vehicles are bumped and scratched as the bus goes by," but the article does not mention this. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may have added unnecessary information or exaggerated the consequences of the accident.

5. The summary states that "two motorists were reportedly taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries," but the article does not mention the number of injured people or their injuries. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may have misinterpreted or added information not supported by the article.

6. The summary states that "the driver is expected to appear in court on Wednesday," but the article does not mention the date of the court appearance. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may have added unnecessary information or misinterpreted the article's information.
