     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Roma and Tottenham have asked to be kept informed about Andre Ayew's status, but the article only mentions that Tottenham and Everton have asked to be kept informed.
2. The summary states that Andre Ayew has netted six times for Marseille this season, but the article states that he has netted six goals for Marseille this season, as well as scoring three during the Africa Cup of Nations.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it leaves out some information and includes some inaccuracies.
