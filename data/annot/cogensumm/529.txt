    Article: 
    Florida mother is looking at her current jail time as a break from parenthood. Monique Miller, 34, appeared before a judge on Tuesday after allegedly throwing her baby from her car in North Miami Beach, Florida. When the judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she seemed only happy to oblige. 'OK, I need a break anyway,' she said. Monique Miller, 34 (right), told a judge on Tuesday that she needs a break from parenting after her arrest for throwing her baby out of a car . Miller was also ordered on Tuesday to take all of her prescribed medications . Cops allegedly tried to pull Miller over Monday afternoon during a routine traffic stop,when the mother was driving with her baby on her lap. Miller at first refused, but when she eventually complied she started yelling obscenities at officers and then tossed her baby out the window. Luckily an officer was able to catch the baby safely. It's unclear how old the baby is. Miller was arrested in the incident, in which she also kicked the cop's car door, causing the door to slam into his head. The mother faces charges of child neglect, criminal mischief and battery on a law enforcement officer. As of Wednesday, she remained in jail on $7,500 bond. In addition to being ordered to stay away from her child, Miller was also told to take prescribed medications. 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the judge ordered the mother to stay away from her child, and the mother responded by saying "OK, I need a break anyway." However, the article states that the mother was arrested for throwing her baby out of a car, which suggests that she did not need a break from her child.
2. The summary implies that the mother was happy to oblige with the judge's order to stay away from her child, but the article states that she started yelling obscenities at officers and kicked the cop's car door, which suggests that she was not happy to comply with the order.
3. The summary does not mention the reason for the mother's arrest or the fact that she threw her baby out of a car, which is a significant detail that is included in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately convey the mother's actions and the reasons for her arrest. The summary is missing important details and presents a misleading picture of the mother's behavior.
