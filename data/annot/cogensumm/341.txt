     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the man struggles to use his hands, but the article does not mention anything about the man struggling to use his hands. In fact, the article states that the man manages to get to his feet with his hands tied behind his back.
2. The summary states that the man is lying next to police officers, but the article does not mention anything about the man being next to police officers. In fact, the article states that the man is lying on the floor a few yards away from four police officers who are trying to detain two other men.
3. The summary states that the man sprints off through a watching crowd, but the article does not mention anything about the man sprinting or running away. Instead, the article states that the police officer spots the man bolting and makes to give chase.
4. The summary states that the man was charged with evading arrest, but the article does not mention anything about the man being charged with evading arrest. Instead, the article states that the escapee suspect was later charged with evading arrest, according to Opposingviews.com.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, the summary states that the man struggles to use his hands, but the article does not support this claim. Additionally, the summary states that the man sprints off through a watching crowd, but the article does not support this claim either.
