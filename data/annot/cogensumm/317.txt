    Summary: 
    manchester united have also been to watch the world cup. 

    Article: 
    Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea have all made enquiries for Palermo striker Paulo Dybala. Manchester United have also been to watch the Argentine but he is not high on their list. The 21-year-old is valued at £30million by Palermo president Mauro Zamparini and Juventus are considered favourites even though they have had an opening offer rejected. Paulo Dybala of Palermo is a transfer target for three British clubs in the summer, but may cost £30million . Palermo are also expecting to sell Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez in the summer transfer window . Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City are three English clubs interested in signing striker Dybala . Palermo also expect to sell Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez this summer. Zamparini said: 'Dybala and Vazquez will probably be sold this summer. Will they go to Milan? No. 'They are being tracked by Juventus, Arsenal, Barcelona, Manchester City, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain.' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Manchester United have also been to watch the World Cup, but there is no mention of this in the article.
2. The article only mentions three British clubs (Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea) that are interested in signing Paulo Dybala, but the summary includes Manchester United, which is not mentioned in the article.
3. The article states that Manchester United are not high on Dybala's list, which contradicts the summary's statement that Manchester United have also been to watch the World Cup.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it includes information that is not supported by the text.
