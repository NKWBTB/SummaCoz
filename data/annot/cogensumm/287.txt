Palermo also expect to sell Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez this summer. Zamparini said: 'Dybala and Vazquez will probably be sold this summer. Will they go to Milan? No. 'They are being tracked by Juventus, Arsenal, Barcelona, Manchester City, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain.' 

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Palermo president Mauro Zamparini values the 21-year-old Paulo Dybala at #30million, but the article does not mention this amount.

2. The article mentions that Juventus have had an opening offer rejected for Dybala, and that Palermo are expecting to sell both Dybala and Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez in the summer transfer window.

3. The article lists Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City as three English clubs interested in signing Dybala, but the summary only mentions Arsenal.

4. The article states that Zamparini expects Dybala and Vazquez to be sold this summer, but does not specify to which clubs.

5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a specific valuation for Dybala that is not supported by the article, and it only mentions Arsenal as a club interested in signing Dybala, while the article lists three clubs. Additionally, the summary does not mention the possibility of Dybala and Vazquez being sold to other clubs besides Juventus.
