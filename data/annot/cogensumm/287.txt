Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the 21-year-old is valued at £30 million for Palermo president Mauro Zamparini.
2. However, the article states that Palermo president Mauro Zamparini values the player at £30 million, but Juventus have had an opening offer rejected.
3. This implies that the player's valuation is not a fixed amount and is subject to negotiation. Therefore, the summary's statement that the player is valued at £30 million for Zamparini is not consistent with the article.
4. Furthermore, the article mentions that other clubs such as Juventus, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City are also interested in signing the player, which is not mentioned in the summary.
5. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article and is not consistent with the information provided.
