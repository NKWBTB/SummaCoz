(CNN)A lot of people have ventured to Paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream. My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: "What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?" And "Where is Paraguay, anyway?" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for "The Missing Bourdain" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film "The Limey" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's "Parts Unknown" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that the author's great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, died in Asunción, Paraguay.
2. The summary only mentions the death of Jean in Asunción, Paraguay, without providing any additional information or context.
3. The article goes on to describe the author's journey to Paraguay to explore his family's past and the country's history, including its reputation for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and its history of lurid dictatorships.
4. The summary does not mention any of these details or the author's personal journey, focusing solely on the death of Jean in Asunción.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the author's journey and the information he discovered about Paraguay. Instead, it only focuses on one specific aspect of the article (the death of Jean) without providing the broader context provided in the article.
