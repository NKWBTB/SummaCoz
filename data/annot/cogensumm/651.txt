    Summary: 
    the news that jean had died in asuncion, paraguay. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)A lot of people have ventured to Paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream. My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: "What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?" And "Where is Paraguay, anyway?" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for "The Missing Bourdain" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film "The Limey" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's "Parts Unknown" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that Jean died in Asuncion, Paraguay, but the article does not mention Jean's death. Instead, the article talks about the author's search for his great-great-grandfather Jean in Paraguay.
2. The summary implies that the article is about Jean's death, but the article is actually about the author's search for his ancestor and his exploration of Paraguay.
3. The summary mentions "the news that Jean had died in Asuncion," but the article does not mention any news or reports of Jean's death.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces information that is not present in the article and creates a different focus (Jean's death) that is not the main topic of the article.
