    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Summary: The summary states that Cate Blanchett always radiates with needles, implying that she uses needles or injections to enhance her appearance. However, the article states that she has avoided going under the knife and relies on beauty secrets to keep her looking her best.
2. Needles vs. Beauty Secrets: The summary mentions needles, which contradicts the article's emphasis on Blanchett's natural beauty and her reliance on beauty secrets rather than medical procedures.
3. Product Mention: The summary mentions a $75 "miracle" product that Blanchett used to keep her makeup fresh throughout the ceremony. However, the article only mentions the SK-II Mid-Day Miracle Essence as a product she used, without mentioning a specific price.
4. Focus on Product: The summary focuses on the product and its price, while the article focuses more on Blanchett's beauty routine and her use of the SK-II Mid-Day Miracle Essence as a part of that routine.
5. Tone: The summary has a more sensational tone, emphasizing the use of needles and the high price of the product, while the article has a more straightforward and factual tone.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it emphasizes medical procedures (needles) and product prices, while the article focuses on natural beauty and the use of beauty secrets.
