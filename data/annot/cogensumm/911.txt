(CNN)A lot of people have ventured to Paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream. My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: "What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?" And "Where is Paraguay, anyway?" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for "The Missing Bourdain" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film "The Limey" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's "Parts Unknown" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Paraguay is "best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis." This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about Paraguay being a hideout for escaped Nazis.
2. The summary also states that Paraguay is "probably best known for a hideout for escaped Nazis." This is still not consistent with the article, as the article does not provide any information about Paraguay being a hideout for escaped Nazis.
3. The article does mention that Paraguay has a history of being a hideout for dictators and other criminals, but it does not specifically mention escaped Nazis.
4. The summary also leaves out important information from the article, such as the fact that the author's great-great-grandfather died in Asuncion, Paraguay, and that the author explores Paraguay and his family's past in a television show.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important information and includes inaccurate information about Paraguay's reputation.
