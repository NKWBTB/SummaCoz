This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel. CCTV footage shows the 65-year-old motorist, who has not been named, slowly drifting off while he navigates a road in Oakland County, Michigan. After stirring he suddenly slams on the brakes, but it proves too late and he collides with a car in front. The driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through. In a bid to avoid further damage, the driver is seen steering the bus into the hard shoulder. A loud scraping noise can be heard as the vehicle drags a trail of debris along. A number of other vehicles are bumped and scratched as the bus goes by. After the driver manages to stop, a woman who was sat in the middle of the coach, exits out of the front door. There were apparently no other passengers on board. Caught on camera: This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that the "driver's side windows immediately shatters and falls through."
2. However, the article states that the driver's side windscreen immediately shatters and falls through, indicating that the entire windscreen, not just the windows, shattered and fell through.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions the windows shattering and falling through, while the article specifically states that the entire windscreen shattered and fell through.
4. The summary also leaves out other important details from the article, such as the fact that the driver fell asleep at the wheel, the bus collided with a car in front, and two motorists were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
5. Overall, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article and does not provide a complete picture of the events described.
