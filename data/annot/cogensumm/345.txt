Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that "Arsenal and Hakan Calhanoglu are tracking Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu." This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that both Arsenal and Manchester City are tracking Calhanoglu, but does not mention Calhanoglu himself being involved in the tracking.
2. The article states that Arsenal and Manchester City have been paying close attention to Calhanoglu's displays, particularly his ability from dead ball situations. The summary does not mention anything about Calhanoglu's abilities or the reasons why Arsenal and Manchester City are tracking him.
3. The article mentions that both Arsenal and Manchester City have scouts monitoring Calhanoglu's progress, but the summary does not mention anything about scouts or monitoring.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary only mentions Arsenal and Calhanoglu, while the article mentions both Arsenal and Manchester City, and provides more details about their interest in Calhanoglu.

###Corrected:
