This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel. CCTV footage shows the 65-year-old motorist, who has not been named, slowly drifting off while he navigates a road in Oakland County, Michigan. After stirring he suddenly slams on the brakes, but it proves too late and he collides with a car in front. The driver's side of the windscreen immediately shatters and falls through. In a bid to avoid further damage, the driver is seen steering the bus into the hard shoulder. A loud scraping noise can be heard as the vehicle drags a trail of debris along. A number of other vehicles are bumped and scratched as the bus goes by. After the driver manages to stop, a woman who was sat in the middle of the coach, exits out of the front door. There were apparently no other passengers on board. Caught on camera: This is the terrifying moment a bus driver rams into a stream of traffic as he falls asleep behind the wheel .
