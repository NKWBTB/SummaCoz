    Article: 
    Second-tier French club Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season after its former president was found guilty of trying to fix matches. After interviewing about 50 officials, players and coaches, the French league disciplinary commission says Jean-Marc Conrad tried to fix four matches as his club fought off relegation last season. He was banned from football-related activities for seven years. Seven games involving Nimes were investigated after Conrad was arrested last November. Nimes' former club president Jean-Marc Conrad was arrested for his involvement in match-fixing last year . The investigation followed a 1-1 draw against Caen last May that kept Nimes in the second division and saw Caen promoted to the top flight. Preliminary charges of corruption have been filed against Caen president Jean-Francois Fortin and Conrad, who has stepped down in the aftermath of the scandal. Nimes can appeal the sanction.

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season, but the article does not mention anything about Nimes being relegated. Instead, the article states that Nimes will be relegated as a result of the match-fixing scandal, but it does not specify when the relegation will occur.
2. The summary mentions that Jean-Marc Conrad tried to fix four matches, but the article only mentions that he was found guilty of trying to fix four matches. The article does not specify which matches Conrad tried to fix or what the outcome of those matches was.
3. The summary states that seven games involving Nimes were investigated, but the article only mentions that seven games were investigated in total, without specifying which teams were involved.
4. The summary mentions that Conrad was banned from football-related activities for seven years, but the article only mentions that he was banned from football-related activities for an unspecified period of time.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and omissions compared to the article. The summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article's content.
