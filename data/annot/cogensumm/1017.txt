    Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get managerial experience of his own before he can be considered as a possible successor to Roy Hodgson as England head coach.

'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both. 'You can't replicate what it's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you. 'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position. 'Gary will get that eventually, but I think he needs, like anybody, to gain the experience, maybe in club football, as a manager and after that probably in international football as well.'

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get managerial experience before he can be considered as a possible successor to Roy Hodgson.
2. However, the article states that Pearce does not believe Neville has the experience to replace Hodgson, and that he needs to gain experience by managing either at club level, international level, or both.
3. The summary does not mention Pearce's doubts about Neville's experience, and instead presents Pearce's statement as a call for Neville to get managerial experience.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect Pearce's views on Neville's readiness for the top job.

In summary, the article presents a more nuanced view of Pearce's comments on Neville's readiness for the England manager job, while the summary presents a simplified version of those comments that is not entirely accurate.
