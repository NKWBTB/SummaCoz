Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders. Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK, the Mail can reveal. Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Tighter measures: Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation’s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade. This would disclose whether they had a clean criminal record or had committed offences. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘This power will enable us to require those applying for a visa to provide a criminal record certificate covering the last ten years – an additional tool to help stop criminals from coming to our country.’ Some 1.9million people arriving on visitor visas, or those from 56 countries and territories which do not need visas, will not need to provide their criminal histories because this would be ‘disproportionate’ in terms of time, cost and bureaucracy. The system will also exempt under-18s, asylum seekers and those people where it is not ‘reasonably practicable’. Tougher stance: Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK .

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years, not that they have committed a crime.
2. The article mentions that the new measures are intended to "bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK." This implies that the purpose of the measures is to prevent criminals from entering the country, not to require them to prove they have committed crimes.
3. The summary states that migrants must prove they have committed a crime, which is the opposite of the article's intended message.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misstates the purpose and requirements of the new measures. The summary should be revised to accurately reflect the content of the article.
