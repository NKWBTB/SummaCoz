Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury. Left-armer Irfan, who has taken eight wickets in five matches so far, underwent an MRI scan after sitting out Pakistan's seven-wicket win over Ireland on Sunday with pain in his hip. After an initial scan proved inconclusive on Monday, Irfan underwent further tests on Tuesday where it was confirmed the seven-foot bowler had suffered 'an obvious stress fracture in the pelvis', according to a Pakistan Cricket Board statement. Mohammad Irfan will take no further part in the World Cup after scans revealed he has a fractured pelvis . Irfan had taken eight wickets in the first five games for Pakistan before missing the Ireland match . Team physiotherapist Brad Robinson said: 'This injury rules Irfan out of the World Cup.' Pakistan face Australia on March 20 in Adelaide, with a potential semi-final against defending champions India at stake, should the latter beat Bangladesh. Pakistan will wait until after the quarter-final before deciding whether to call up a replacement for Irfan.
