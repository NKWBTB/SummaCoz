    Summary: 
    my great-great-grandfather, jean bourdain, is one of them. 

    Article: 
    (CNN)A lot of people have ventured to Paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream. My great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, was one of them. I've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in Uruguay, with my younger brother Chris. We were disappointed when our trail ran cold. We were left with a cryptic reference to the news that Jean had died in Asuncion, Paraguay. Which raised the questions: "What the hell was he doing in Paraguay?" And "Where is Paraguay, anyway?" Roots: Our Journeys Home . It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. It's certainly a country few of us know much about. Landlocked by its better-known neighbors, Paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped Nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid, out-of-a-comic-book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. When I first looked at the possibility of making a television show there, many years ago, descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising: crime, corruption, counterfeiters, failed institutions, looted banks -- in short, a backwater. I thought I'd use the dubious quest for "The Missing Bourdain" as the spine of a show, a framework to investigate one of the least-known nations in the Americas. My crew, looking at various storytelling structures, settled on the terrific film "The Limey" as a rough template. In that film, Terence Stamp, playing a just-out-of-prison career criminal, voyages to Los Angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter. In this week's "Parts Unknown" episode, I explore Paraguay (and my family's past) in similar nonlinear fashion. It's an amazing-looking show. Everybody who worked on it, handcrafted it, is convinced it's some of their best work. What I found out -- about Paraguay, about my family -- surprised me. I hope it entertains you.

     Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary mentions that the author's great-great-grandfather, Jean Bourdain, is one of the people who ventured to Paraguay in search of a dream.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the author's family history or personal connection to Paraguay. Instead, the article focuses on the author's curiosity about the country and his decision to explore it for a television show.
3. The summary implies that the author's great-great-grandfather died in Paraguay, but the article does not mention this detail.
4. The summary also suggests that the author is on a mission to find out more about his family's past in Paraguay, but the article does not convey this sense of personal investigation. Instead, the article presents the author's exploration of Paraguay as a journalistic endeavor to learn more about the country.

Overall, the summary presents a personal and family-focused narrative that is not supported by the content of the article. The article is more focused on the author's curiosity about Paraguay and his decision to explore it for a television show, without mentioning any personal connections or family history.
