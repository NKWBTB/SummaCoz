Button seen on the tail of Toro Rosso driver Carlos Sainz at the Sepang International Circuit . But Button was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely Australian Grand Prix where he could only manage to nurse the car home. He told Sky Sports: 'I would rather this way around (being forced to retire) than get to the end and be nowhere. 'We were quicker than the Force India. The Sauber was there and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. It was a nice surprise but it was also good to see where our strengths and weaknesses were compared to the rest of the cars.

</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Jenson Button was happy to be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix.
2. However, the article states that both Button and his teammate Fernando Alonso failed to finish the race.
3. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Button was happy to be more competitive at the race, as he did not finish the race and his team did not perform well.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article, as it only highlights one aspect of the race (Button's happiness) while ignoring other important details (the fact that both drivers failed to finish the race).
5. The summary does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the article's content, which is why it is not consistent with the article.
