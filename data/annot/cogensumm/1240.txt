    Article: 
    Jenson Button was pleasantly surprised by McLaren's performance at the Malaysian Grand Prix despite the fact both he and Fernando Alonso failed to finish the race. The McLaren pair began the race with Button 17th and Alonso 18th but were involved in a battle in the middle of the pack for the first half of the race. Alonso was forced to retire, though, after being called in by his team after 21 laps while Button lasted double the amount of time as his team-mate. Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix . Fernando Alonso only lasted 21 laps in Sepang in his first race of the 2015 season . Button seen on the tail of Toro Rosso driver Carlos Sainz at the Sepang International Circuit . But Button was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely Australian Grand Prix where he could only manage to nurse the car home. He told Sky Sports: 'I would rather this way around (being forced to retire) than get to the end and be nowhere. 'We were quicker than the Force India. The Sauber was there and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. It was a nice surprise but it was also good to see where our strengths and weaknesses were compared to the rest of the cars. 'It was interesting to race with other people and a little bit unexpected. It wasn't so bad, it was just a little bit messy with the pit stop and safety car.'

     Sure! Here's why the given summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Fernando Alonso only lasted 21 laps in his first race of the 2015 season, while the article states that he lasted for double the amount of time as his teammate Jenson Button, which is 42 laps.
2. The summary mentions that Jenson Button was happy to be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix, but the article states that both Button and Alonso failed to finish the race.
3. The summary does not mention the fact that Alonso was forced to retire due to a technical issue, while the article mentions this as the reason for his early exit.
4. The summary does not mention the part where Button was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely Australian Grand Prix, which is mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and is therefore not consistent with it.
