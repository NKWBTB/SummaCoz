    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Roma and Tottenham have asked to be kept informed, but the article does not mention this.
2. The article only mentions that Tottenham and Everton have asked to be kept informed, but does not mention Roma.
3. Therefore, the statement in the summary that Roma has asked to be kept informed is not supported by the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it incorrectly includes Roma as a club that has asked to be kept informed, when in fact, the article only mentions Tottenham and Everton.
