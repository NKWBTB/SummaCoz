'Recently we have focused on teaching him routines rather than new tricks and we reward him with positive reinforcement - praise, love, cuddles and of course treats and toys.

'Staffordshire Bull Terriers are very intelligent, loving and loyal - but sadly this doesn't stop people mistreating or abandoning them. 'Most rescue centres are filled with unwanted Staffies and they are having difficulty re-homing them. 'The breed gets a lot of negative speculation which definitely does not help the situation and people may not want to adopt them, and as a result many are being put down. If people stopped judging them and started helping them, it would really make a difference and prevent so many good dogs being put to sleep.'

    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

1. The summary states that the owner, Adem Basharan, began training his dog, Ziggy, when the staffie was 14 weeks old. However, the article states that Adem has had Ziggy since November 2013, when Ziggy was just a pup, and Ziggy learned his name after just one day.

2. The summary mentions that Ziggy can play dead, free run, skateboard, tidy up, and perform martial arts stunts. However, the article only mentions that Ziggy can play dead, free run, skateboard, and tidy up.

3. The summary states that Adem has had Ziggy for one and a half years. However, the article states that Adem has had Ziggy since November 2013, which is more than one and a half years ago.

4. The summary does not mention anything about Ziggy's training focusing on routines rather than individual tricks, as stated in the article.

5. The summary does not mention anything about Ziggy's talents helping to disprove public stereotypes that Staffordshire bull terriers are a dangerous breed, as stated in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omissions.
