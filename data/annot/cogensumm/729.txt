    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure, I can explain the reasons why the summary is not consistent with the article. Here are the steps:

1. The summary states that Palermo is a transfer target for three British clubs in the summer, but the article does not mention anything about Palermo being a transfer target. Instead, it mentions that three British clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City) are interested in signing Dybala, who plays for Palermo.
2. The summary mentions that Paulo Dybala is valued at £30million by Palermo president Mauro Zamparini, but the article does not mention this detail. The article only states that Zamparini has said that Dybala and Vazquez will probably be sold this summer, without mentioning the price.
3. The summary states that Juventus are considered favourites to sign Dybala, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article states that Juventus have had an opening offer rejected and that Palermo are expecting to sell both Dybala and Vazquez this summer.
4. The summary mentions that Palermo are also expecting to sell Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez in the summer transfer window, but the article does not mention this.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits some details, adds some inaccurate information, and includes information that is not present in the article.
