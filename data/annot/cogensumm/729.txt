</Summary>

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The summary states that Palermo is a transfer target for three British clubs in the summer.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about Palermo being a transfer target for British clubs. Instead, it mentions that Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester City have made enquiries for Paulo Dybala, who plays for Palermo.
3. The article also mentions that Juventus are considered favorites to sign Dybala, and that Palermo are expecting to sell both Dybala and Italy midfielder Franco Vazquez in the summer transfer window.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions Palermo being a transfer target for British clubs, while the article provides information about Dybala being the target of several clubs, including Juventus, and Palermo's intention to sell both Dybala and Vazquez.
