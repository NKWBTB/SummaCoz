Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury. Left-armer Irfan, who has taken eight wickets in five matches so far, underwent an MRI scan after sitting out Pakistan's seven-wicket win over Ireland on Sunday with pain in his hip. After an initial scan proved inconclusive on Monday, Irfan underwent further tests on Tuesday where it was confirmed the seven-foot bowler had suffered 'an obvious stress fracture in the pelvis', according to a Pakistan Cricket Board statement. Mohammad Irfan will take no further part in the World Cup after scans revealed he has a fractured pelvis . Irfan had taken eight wickets in the first five games for Pakistan before missing the Ireland match . Team physiotherapist Brad Robinson said: 'This injury rules Irfan out of the World Cup.'

Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]

1. The article states that Mohammad Irfan has taken eight wickets in five matches so far, while the summary states that he has taken three wickets. This is inconsistent, as the article states a higher number of wickets taken by Irfan.
2. The article states that Irfan will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a pelvis injury, while the summary does not mention anything about the injury. This is inconsistent, as the article provides specific information about Irfan's injury, but the summary does not include this information.
3. The article states that Pakistan will wait until after the quarter-final to decide whether to call up a replacement for Irfan, while the summary does not mention anything about this. This is inconsistent, as the article provides additional information about Pakistan's plans after Irfan's injury, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary should be revised to include all the information provided in the article, including Irfan's injury and Pakistan's plans for a replacement.
