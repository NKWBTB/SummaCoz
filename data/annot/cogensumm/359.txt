    Explain your reasoning step by step:[/INST]
     Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that Roma and Everton have asked to be kept informed, but the article does not mention this.
2. The article mentions that Tottenham, Everton, and Roma have expressed interest in the player, but the summary only mentions Roma and Everton.
3. The article states that Newcastle have made an initial approach for the player, but the summary does not mention this.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. Specifically, it does not mention Tottenham's interest, it only mentions Roma and Everton's interest, and it does not mention Newcastle's initial approach.
