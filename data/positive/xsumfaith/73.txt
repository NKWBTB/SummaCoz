1. The article states that "the Daily Politics is on BBC2 from 1200-1300 on weekdays, with an 1130 start on Wednesdays for PMQs, and the Sunday Politics is on BBC1 from 1100-1215." This implies that the daily and Sunday politics shows are on air six days a week for much of the year, reporting political news from Westminster and beyond.

Therefore, the sentence that expresses the claim is:

"The Daily Politics is on BBC2 from 1200-1300 on weekdays, with an 1130 start on Wednesdays for PMQs, and the Sunday Politics is on BBC1 from 1100-1215."
