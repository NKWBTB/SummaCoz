<Article>
The boy, Julian Hernandez, disappeared when he was five and is now 18, living with his father in Cleveland.
Bobby Hernandez, 53, was arrested and is being held at a jail in Ohio.
The FBI received a tip on 30 October that this teenager may be the long-missing child after problems he had applying for college.
The agency worked with Alabama police and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to confirm the boy's identity.
His mother has been notified of his recovery, AL.com reports.
His father is also charged with tampering with records in Ohio so he could obtain a driver's licence in 2012.
He is being held at the Cuyahoga County Jail in Ohio with a $250,000 (Â£164,100) bail.
Authorities suspected around the time of the boy's disappearance that his father was possibly the culprit, according to AL.com.
A missing persons database shows that Mr Hernandez said he was taking his son to pre-school in August 2002 but then fled.
