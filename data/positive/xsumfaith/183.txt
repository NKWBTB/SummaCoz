"I'm sitting in my car on the pavement in order to maintain some height just down from the Bar Hill roundabout near Tesco.
"There are cars everywhere and the flooding is getting worse as people are trying to drive through it, but their engines are cutting out which is causing them to block the road."
Fire service group commander Ryan Stacey said: "We have seven crews currently in the March, Doddington and Wisbech St Mary areas, assisting with evacuating residents, salvaging and pumping water out of homes.
"The exact number of properties affected cannot be confirmed, but we understand that we are assisting currently at least 60 properties."
He warned: "Don't try to drive through standing water - as well as the water damaging your car, there may be hazards under the water you can't see."

Your reponse:[/INST]

1. The article states that "homes were evacuated" and "about 60 properties" were affected by flooding in Cambridgeshire.
2. The article also mentions that "widespread flooding" was caused by flash flooding, and that water was "laping over the kerb" and "pouring through the ceiling" in some areas.

Therefore, the claim that "homes have been flooded in parts of Cambridgeshire" is supported by the information in the article.
