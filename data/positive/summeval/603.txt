Gregory van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain in the summer and instead reiterated his 'love' for the club. The Dutchman recently had a falling out with his boss Laurent Blanc after the decision to drop the full back for the Champions League clash against Chelsea. But Van der Wiel insists he's happy in Paris and is making no plans to leave the Ligue 1 side. Gregory van der Wiel (right) says he's not interested in leaving Paris Saint-Germain in the summer . The full back had a recent spat with the manager Laurent Blanc (right) after he was dropped . He told L'Equipe: 'I am genuinely happy at PSG. 'I love the club, I love the city and I love my team-mates. Everything is perfect for me here. 'There is absolutely no reason for me to leave. I want to sign a new contract. 'If the coach decides not to play me, that is his decision. But I am ready whenever I am called upon.' The Parisians continue to be linked with Barcelona star Dani Alves, so it remains to be seen whether Van der Wiel has any choice in staying with the club. Dani Alves (left) is being linked with a move to the French champions and Van der Wiel could be sold .
