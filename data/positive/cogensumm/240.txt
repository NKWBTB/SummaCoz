'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both. 'You can't replicate what it's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you. 'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position. 'Gary will get that eventually, but I think he needs, like anybody, to gain the experience, maybe in club football, as a manager and after that probably in international football as well.'
