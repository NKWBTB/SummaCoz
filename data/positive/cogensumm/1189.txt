The Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, where an 'Easter Hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved. Much like Father Christmas, the brown-coloured animals was often depicted carrying a selection of treats to good children's houses.

The symbol of the Easter often results in a terrifying sight when produced on a budget. Children who would usually be delighted to be meeting someone who will be gifting them with chocolate eggs end up screaming for their parents.
