<Article>
this dog 's certainly not setting a good example to the youngsters under her charge .
gemma the pit bull was filmed at home in california being fed some treats .
but in a bid to trick her , her owner throws a broccoli spear into the mix .
immediately the canine pulls a look of disgust as she chomps on the vegetable .
she then proceeds to spit it out on the floor .
let 's hope the two children she lives with do n't follow her lead and they learn to love their greens .
when she 's not filling her face , other videos show gemma enjoys sleeping and hanging out with her human family .
yuck : gemma the pit bull was filmed at home in california being fed some treats , but in a bid to trick her , her owner throws a broccoli spear into the mix
not a broccoli fan : immediately the canine pulls a look of disgust as she chomps on the vegetable - she then proceeds to spit it out on the floor
