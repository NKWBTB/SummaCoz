The summary implies that tens of thousands of people attended the annual Anzac Day parade in the Gallipoli landings in Hyde Park.\n2. However, the article does not mention an Anzac Day parade in the Gallipoli landings in Hyde Park. The article discusses Anzac Day services and events held in London, including a service at Hyde Park Corner, a parade, and the wreath-laying at the Cenotaph. These events commemorate the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.\n3.

The article mentions that thousands of people attended the early morning service at Hyde Park Corner, and up to 400 people took part in the parade before the wreath-laying at the Cenotaph.\n2. The article does not mention the exact number of people who attended the parade, but it does say that crowds, including Australia and New Zealand ex-pats, lined the streets to watch the ceremony.\n3. The summary states that tens of thousands of people have attended the annual Anzac Day parade in Hyde Park, which is not supported by the information in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary exaggerates the number of people who attended the parade, which is not supported by the information in the article."}
