The summary states that the two main political parties in the Republic of Ireland are to vote on whether to take control of water charges. 2. However, the article states that water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement. In the article, there is no mention of voting to take control of water charges. Instead, the two parties are negotiating to reach an agreement.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, the two main political parties in the Republic of Ireland, are hoping to avoid a second election.\n2. The article states that Fianna F\u00e1il wants to see the immediate removal of water charges, while Fine Gael sees a role for them.\n3. The article mentions that a commission to consider the future of national water utility Irish Water is one of the proposals being considered.\n4. The summary states that the two main political parties are to vote on whether to take control of water charges.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article. The article mentions the parties' differing stances on water charges and the proposal to establish a commission to consider the future of Irish Water, which could potentially lead to a vote on the matter. Therefore, I would answer (yes) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
