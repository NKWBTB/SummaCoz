The article mentions that West Ham United Football Club has been linked to takeovers from Qatari and Chinese groups, but it does not mention anything about the club making a takeover offer for a Chinese energy firm.\n2. The article does mention that the club's co-owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, have a majority stake in the club and have indicated that they intend to pass ownership down to their children.\n3. The summary, on the other hand, states that West Ham has made a takeover offer for a Chinese energy firm, which is not consistent with the information provided in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
