The article states that Richard Ellis is the former interim director of corporate governance and has been acting as deputy chief executive for several months.\n3. The article quotes Stephen Flynn, the leader of the opposition SNP group, saying that the departures are indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff.\n4. The article mentions that Mr. Monaghan is head of the chief executive's office, while Mr. Sutherland is head of human resources and customer services.\n5. The article ends with a quote from council chief executive Angela Scott thanking the trio for their dedication and professionalism.\n\nNow, let's compare this information with the summary:\n\n1. The summary states that the chief executive of the republic of ireland council will not stand in the job of the local authority.\n\nBased on the information in the article, there is no mention of the chief executive of the republic of Ireland council, nor is there any mention of them not standing in the job of the local authority.

The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, specifically the mention of the chief executive of the republic of Ireland council."}
