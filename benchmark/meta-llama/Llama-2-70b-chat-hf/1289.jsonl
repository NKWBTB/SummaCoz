The article mentions that the Lower Bristol Road in Bath was closed due to a crash, and the summary does not mention this.\n2. The article states that the road closure caused disruption and delays to commuters and bus services during rush hour, and the summary does not mention this either.\n3. The article mentions that investigations are under way into how the collision happened, and the summary does not mention this.\n4. The article quotes the managing director of First, James Freeman, saying that they are hoping to have a full service running in time for the evening commute, and the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on the above points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that a major road has reopened in Bristol following a crash involving two commuters, but it does not provide any additional information or context that is present in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
