Here's why:\n\n1. The article states that the Mariana Trench is located in the Pacific Ocean, while the summary mentions the Atlantic Ocean. This is a significant discrepancy, as the two oceans are separated by a large distance.\n2. The article mentions the use of a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera, while the summary mentions a \"tiny camera\" that has been caught up in an eruption. The article does not mention anything about the size of the camera, and it is unlikely that a tiny camera would be able to capture the images described in the article.\n3. The article mentions the expedition's focus on finding fish, mud volcanoes, and deep sea coral, while the summary only mentions an underwater eruption. While it's possible that the expedition could have encountered an eruption, the summary does not mention any of the other elements mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
