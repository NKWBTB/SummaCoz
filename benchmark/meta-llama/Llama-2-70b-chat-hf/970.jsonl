The article supports this by mentioning that Van der Wiel was dropped for the Champions League clash against Chelsea, which led to a spat between the two.\n3. The summary states that the Parisians continue to be linked with a move to the French champions. The article supports this by mentioning that the club is being linked with Barcelona star Dani Alves.\n4. The summary states that Dani Alves is being linked to move to the French champions. The article supports this by mentioning that the Parisians continue to be linked with a move to the French champions.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer (yes) that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.
