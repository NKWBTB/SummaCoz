Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary states that Filipe Luis insists he wants to stay at Chelsea until the end of his contract, which is supported by the article's quote from Luis: \"I\u2019m happy at Chelsea. I want to stay at the club until the end of my contract.\"\n2. The summary mentions that Atletico Madrid are considering bringing Luis back in the summer, which is also mentioned in the article: \"Atletico hope that may give them leverage, but Luis said: \u2018I\u2019m happy at Chelsea. I want to stay at the club until the end of my contract.\u2019\"\n3. The summary states that Luis played in Brazil's friendly wins against France and Chile during the international break, which is supported by the article's statement: \"Luis played in Brazil\u2019s friendly wins against France and Chile during the international break.\"\n4. The summary does not mention anything about Luis's struggles to make the left back position his own at Stamford Bridge, which is mentioned in the article: \"The full back signed a three-year contract when he moved from the Spanish champions last July, but has struggled to make the left back position his own at Stamford Bridge.\" However, this omission does not make the summary inconsistent with the article, as it only mentions information that is not present in the summary, but does not contradict any information that is present.\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
