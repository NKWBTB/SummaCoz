The summary claims that Shutter Speed won the Epsom Derby for the second year running, but the article does not support this claim.\n3. The article states that Shutter Speed will be heading to Chantilly for the French Oaks, which suggests that she did not compete in the Epsom Derby.\n4. The article also mentions that John Gosden has concerns about the ground for his colt Cracksman in the Dante Stakes, which is a different race than the Epsom Derby.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The article does not mention Shutter Speed competing in the Epsom Derby, let alone winning it for the second year running. Therefore, the answer is no."}
