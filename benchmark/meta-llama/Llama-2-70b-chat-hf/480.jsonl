The summary implies that a cat has been found dead after a \"massive\" chemical spill in a street in Leicestershire.\n2. However, the article does not mention a \"massive\" chemical spill in a street in Leicestershire. The article reports that several cats near Victor Avenue in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, have ingested a toxic substance, which has led to their deaths.\n3.

The article mentions that several cats in the area have died due to ingesting antifreeze, and one of the cats, Meereen, died after being taken to the vets.\n2. The summary mentions a \"massive\" chemical spill, but the article does not mention the size of the spill.\n3. The summary implies that the spill was the cause of the cat's death, but the article does not confirm this.\n4. The article mentions that the RSPCA is appealing for people in the area to ensure pesticides and chemicals are stored safely, suggesting that the poisoning may have been accidental or deliberate.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary sensationalizes the story by using the term \"massive\" and implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the spill and the cat's death, which is not supported by the information in the article."}
