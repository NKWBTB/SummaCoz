The article states that the driver, Andreas Werner, was fined \u00a31,000 and banned from driving in the UK for two years, but it does not mention anything about him being jailed.\n2. The summary states that the motorist was jailed for eight years, which is a significant difference from the penalty mentioned in the article.\n3.

The summary does not mention anything about the driver's remorse or lack of explanation for the crash, which are details that are present in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article."}
