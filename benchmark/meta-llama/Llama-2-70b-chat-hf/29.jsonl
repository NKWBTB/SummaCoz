'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both. 'You can't replicate what it's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you. 'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position.

The article mentions that Stuart Pearce, a former manager of England's Under-21 team, does not believe Gary Neville has the experience to replace Roy Hodgson as the head coach of the English national team.\n2. The article quotes Pearce as saying that managing at club level or international level is necessary to gain the experience needed for the top job in English football.\n3. The article states that Neville has never managed a club or international side before, which suggests that he lacks the experience that Pearce believes is necessary for the role.\n4. The summary, on the other hand, simply states that Neville has been tipped to replace Hodgson, without mentioning any concerns about his lack of experience.\n\nBased on the above, it seems that the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it does not mention the concerns about Neville's experience that are discussed in the article. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
