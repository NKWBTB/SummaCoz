The article mentions that Johnny McGurk, the accused, is from County Londonderry, which is different from County Down. Therefore, the summary is already inconsistent with the article.\n2. The article does not mention the name of the company owner, Patrick Bradley Ltd., as a former professional footballer. This information is not supported by the article, and the summary is inconsistent with it.\n3. The summary mentions the amount of money stolen as \u00a3500,000, while the article states the amount as \u00a3572,206. This discrepancy further supports the inconsistency between the summary and the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
