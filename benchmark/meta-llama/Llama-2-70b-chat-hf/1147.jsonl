The article mentions that the new owners of Fosse Park, Crown Estates, want to address parking and congestion issues around the park.\n2. The article quotes Paul Clarke, director of investments at Crown Estates, saying that they want to improve the quality of the common areas, including parking, to make sure the location is as good as it can be.\n3. The summary states that over 100 new parking units are needed to improve facilities at a West Yorkshire park, which suggests that the park in question is Fosse Park.\n4. However, the article does not mention anything about the specific number of parking units needed, nor does it mention any plans for new parking units.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer (no) the question, as the summary is not entirely consistent with the corresponding article. While the article mentions the need to improve parking and congestion issues, it does not provide any specific details about the number of parking units needed or any plans for new parking units."}
