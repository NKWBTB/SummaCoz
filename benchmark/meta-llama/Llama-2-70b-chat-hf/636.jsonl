There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"", "claim": "the local authorities in scotland have \" serious problems \" with the council tax system, a report has found.", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "33811105", "model_name": "BERTS2S", "annotations": [1, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "xsum", "error_type": "EntE", "doc_sents": ["Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this", "linkA", "review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system.", "It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.", "The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.", "Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.", "He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.", "But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.", "Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.", "Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.", "But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated.", "There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.", "He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.", "\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So", "whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.", "\"The", "commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.", "A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".", "He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.", "\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\""], "sum_sents": ["the local authorities in scotland have \" serious problems \" with the council tax system, a report has found."], "rel_index": [3, 10, 13, 16, 17], "cot": "1. The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary suggests that local authorities in Scotland have encountered significant issues with the council tax system, as described in a report.\n2. However, the article discusses the problems and challenges associated with the council tax system but does not explicitly use the phrase or mention that local authorities in Scotland have \"serious problems\" with the system.\n3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of the specific phrase \"serious problems,\" which is not directly supported by the article. The article conveys issues with the council tax system but doesn't use this exact wording.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that the Commission on Local Tax Reform found that the council tax system in Scotland has built-in problems and that a failure to modify it has stored up more difficulties for policy makers.\n2. The article also states that Prof Kenneth Gibb, who conducted a review of different systems of local taxation, found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid, and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.\n3. However, the article also notes that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer, but it created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated, and there was little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.\n4. The article concludes by stating that the commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn, and that the Scottish government awaits the commission's report.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the commission's report has not yet been published, and therefore, the summary's statement that the local authorities in Scotland have \"serious problems\" with the council tax system is not fully supported by the article. While the article does mention that the council tax system has built-in problems and that reform is necessary, it does not explicitly state that the local authorities have serious problems with the system.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
