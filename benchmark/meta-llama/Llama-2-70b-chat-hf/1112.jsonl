The article talks about the design of the medals, which feature symbols of every event and the London skyline, and the summary does not mention anything about the medal design, which is not a contradiction.\n5. The article mentions that the reverse of the medal will feature London Stadium, the championships' venue, and the summary does not mention anything about the reverse side of the medal, which is not a contradiction.\n6. The article mentions that there will be 'coaches medals' handed out for the first time at the World Championships, and the summary does not mention anything about this, which is not a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the summary is consistent with the article as it does not contradict any of the information mentioned in the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
