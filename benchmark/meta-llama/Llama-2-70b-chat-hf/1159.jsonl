In the article, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m is the Swedish Foreign Miniter.\n2. The summary states that Johan Gusttrom has been freed after two suspected kidnappings in a raid in Mali. However, the article does not mention anything about two suspected kidnappings.

The article mentions that Johan Gustafsson, a Swedish citizen, was kidnapped by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) along with two other men.\n2. The article states that Gustafsson was released thanks to \"extensive efforts\" and co-operation between the Swedish foreign ministry, police, and \"foreign authorities.\"\n3. The article quotes Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m as saying that Gustafsson was \"in good spirits\" and \"happy\" and \"overwhelmed\" by Monday's events.\n4. The article mentions that Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that Gustafsson's kidnapping weighed heavily on his mind during his time in the role.\n5. The summary states that Swedish foreign minister Johan Gusttrom has been freed after two suspected kidnappings in a raid in Mali, his foreign ministry says.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the summary is consistent with the information provided. The article mentions Gustafsson's kidnapping and release, as well as the involvement of the Swedish foreign ministry in securing his release. The summary accurately reflects this information, stating that Gusttrom (which is likely a typo of Gustafsson) has been freed after a raid in Mali.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
