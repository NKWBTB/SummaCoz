Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit, and X-ray and space for mobile scanners. The summary does not mention these specific details, but it does mention that the new hospital will have a total cost of \u00a333m, which is consistent with the article.\n2. The article quotes Matron Sue Taylor and Dr Donal Hynes, who both express their support for the new hospital and explain how it will improve the quality of care for patients. The summary does not include these quotes, but it does mention that health officials from Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust have announced plans to build the new hospital, which is consistent with the article.\n3. The article mentions that the current hospital was built in 1813 and has become cramped and outdated. The summary does not mention the age of the current hospital, but it does mention that the new hospital will be built on land at Bowers Lane, which is consistent with the article.\n4. The article mentions that the total cost of the project is \u00a333m, and that the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The summary does not mention the specific cost of the project, but it does mention that the new hospital will have a total cost of \u00a333m, which is consistent with the article.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary provides a brief overview of the plans to build a new hospital in Somerset, while the article provides more detailed information about the hospital's features, the reasons for building a new hospital, and the reactions of health officials. Therefore, I answer (yes) the question: Is the following summary consistent with the corresponding article?"}
