Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions that MacDonald signed for Torquay in 2014, while the summary states that he was signed by Stevenage on a two-year deal following his release by Brighton. This discrepancy suggests that the summary is not accurately summarizing the information in the article.\n2. The article mentions that MacDonald has played for Reading and Wimbledon, but the summary does not mention this. This omission suggests that the summary is not comprehensive and may be missing important details.\n3. The article quotes the head coach of Torquay, Paul Heckingbottom, but the summary does not include any quotes or references to the coach's statement. This suggests that the summary is not fully representative of the article's content.\n\nTherefore, based on these inconsistencies, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
