The summary states that Barcelona received a \"substantial\" tax claim over the signing of Neymar from Barcelona last month.\n2. However, the article does not mention Barcelona receiving a tax claim but rather discusses Barcelona making a \"complimentary tax declaration\" in response to potential divergent interpretations of tax responsibilities related to Neymar's signing. It clarifies that Barcelona's board denies any tax-related crime and emphasizes that they believe their original tax payment was in line with fiscal obligations.\n3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the error that implies Barcelona received a tax claim, while the article focuses on Barcelona's declaration to address potential tax-related issues concerning Neymar's signing.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Barcelona paid \u00a348.6m for Neymar, and that his parents received \u00a334m of the fee.\n2. The article also mentions that there have been allegations that the actual cost of the player was far greater than the initial fee paid.\n3. The article states that a judge in Spain ruled that there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer.\n4. The article quotes a club statement saying that the board denies the existence of any tax-related crime in relation to the fiscal obligations arising from the signing of the player.\n5. The article mentions that Barcelona has made a complimentary tax declaration of a total of 13,550,830.56 euros.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that there is an ongoing investigation into the transfer of Neymar to Barcelona, and that the club has made a payment to cover any potential tax obligations arising from the signing. However, it is not clear whether the case will be dropped after Barcelona's payment.\n\nTherefore, the summary that Barcelona say they have received a \"substantial\" tax claim over the signing of Neymar from Barcelona last month is not entirely consistent with the article. While the article does mention a tax claim, it does not specify the amount of the claim or whether it is considered \"substantial\" by Barcelona.\n\nMy answer is therefore no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
