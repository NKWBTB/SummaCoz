{"document": "(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for \"Barbara,\" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the \"warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited \"three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,\" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to \"navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,\" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. \"Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,\" Mate said.

The summary states that the record was set by a whale whale whale but the article says that previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile\n2. The summary states that the north coast of Mexico is Russian for \"Barbara\". This statement is also incorrect, as the article does not mention anything about the north coast of Mexico being Russian for \"Barbara\".\n3. The summary does not mention that \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\"\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that a North Pacific gray whale named Varvara swam nearly 14,000 miles, which is the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded, according to Guinness World Records. The summary correctly states this information.\n2. The article explains that Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness World Records website, which was set by a humpback whale that swam a 10,190-mile round trip. The summary accurately reports this information as well.\n3. The article notes that Varvara's trip was surprising because she visited three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales, which suggests that she might be an eastern gray whale rather than a western gray whale, which is an endangered species. The summary does not mention this detail, but it does mention that Varvara's ability to navigate across open water over long distances is impressive and could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays.\n4. The article quotes Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, as saying that past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but Varvara's journey suggests that we may need to take a closer look. The summary does not mention this quote or the detail about genetic differentiation.\n5. The article ends by mentioning that four baby orcas have been born this season, which is not related to the main topic of Varvara's migration. The summary does not mention this detail.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately reports the main points of the article, but it does not include all of the details or quotes from the article. Therefore, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
