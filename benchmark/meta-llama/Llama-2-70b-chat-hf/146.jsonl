A mother has said she is 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead at their home in Dundee. Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of\u00a0Sophia Walker after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of\u00a0Saturday. Her mother Patricia Hodgdon, 34, wrote a series of messages on Facebook saying: 'Me and Chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak. 'I want her back. Please please. Why why please say I'm dreaming plz.' Ambulance crews rushed to the home in Dundee\u00a0after receiving reports of the  sudden death, but they were unable to revive the baby. It is understood that Sophia\u00a0was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father, Charles Walker, at the home in Kirkton. Both the parents were being comforted by friends and relatives today and\u00a0flowers were laid at the gate of the house. Police Scotland confirmed an investigation has been launched into the death and that it is being treated as unexplained. A spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained. Inquiries are at an early stage and as is standard practice a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.' Neighbour Dexylee Mullady, 19, said she was shocked and saddened that the baby had died. She said: 'I have only ever seen pictures of her on Facebook and never seen her outside. She looked like she was a tiny little thing - I can't believe this has happened. 'This is really horrible - we can't imagine what the family must be going through.' She said police had been outside the home in Dundee all weekend. A police van  was outside the home in Dundee all weekend and friends left flowers and tributes at the gate .", "claim": "police have launched probe into 'unexplained death' of sophia walker. police have launched a probe into the 'tragic death' of sophia walker. mother said she was 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead. her mother patricia hodgdon, 34, wrote: 'me and chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak' sophia was born premature in late december and lived with mother and father.", "cnndm_id": "6b98c92e0fe58e6ff1624ffed99889f49b1eae76", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of Sophia Walker (pictured) after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of Saturday .", "A mother has said she is 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead at their home in Dundee.", "Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of\u00a0Sophia Walker after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of\u00a0Saturday.", "Her mother Patricia Hodgdon, 34, wrote a series of messages on Facebook saying: 'Me and Chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak.", "'I want her back.", "Please please.", "Why why please say I'm dreaming plz.'", "Ambulance crews rushed to the home in Dundee\u00a0after receiving reports of the  sudden death, but they were unable to revive the baby.", "It is understood that Sophia\u00a0was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father, Charles Walker, at the home in Kirkton.", "Both the parents were being comforted by friends and relatives today and\u00a0flowers were laid at the gate of the house.", "Police Scotland confirmed an investigation has been launched into the death and that it is being treated as unexplained.", "A spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained.", "Inquiries are at an early stage and as is standard practice a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.'", "Neighbour Dexylee Mullady, 19, said she was shocked and saddened that the baby had died.", "She said: 'I have only ever seen pictures of her on Facebook and never seen her outside.", "She looked like she was a tiny little thing - I can't believe this has happened.", "'This is really horrible - we can't imagine what the family must be going through.'", "She said police had been outside the home in Dundee all weekend.", "A police van  was outside the home in Dundee all weekend and friends left flowers and tributes at the gate ."], "sum_sents": ["police have launched probe into 'unexplained death' of sophia walker.", "police have launched a probe into the 'tragic death' of sophia walker.", "mother said she was 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead.", "her mother patricia hodgdon, 34, wrote: 'me and chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak'", "sophia was born premature in late december and lived with mother and father."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 3, 8], "cot": "1.
