The article mentions Pochettino's comments about Spurs' performance in the first 45 minutes of the game against Liverpool, where they were not ready to fight for the Premier League.\n2. Pochettino also mentions that the team has won just twice on the road since September and have struggled against top-six sides away from home.\n3.

Despite these criticisms, the summary states that Pochettino believes Tottenham can still win the Premier League title.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it seems that Pochettino's comments about Spurs' ability to win the title are not entirely consistent with the team's recent performances. The team's struggles on the road and against top-six sides, as well as Pochettino's own criticism of their performance, suggest that they may not be in the best position to challenge for the title.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
