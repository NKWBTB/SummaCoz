The article states that Many Clouds, the horse in question, died due to a severe pulmonary haemorrhage, which is a rare condition.\n2. The article also mentions that the horse had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, but had never collapsed before and had shown no symptoms of post-race ataxia on the day of the race.\n3. The article quotes the acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, Tony Welsh, as saying that episodes like this are rare and can occur in horses with no underlying health issues.\n4. The summary, on the other hand, states that the horse died due to severe brain injuries.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the details provided. The article does not mention anything about brain injuries, and instead attributes the horse's death to a pulmonary haemorrhage. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
