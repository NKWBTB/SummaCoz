However, the article is about the search for Trevor Deely, who was last seen in December 2000, which is more than two decades ago, not last month. The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, the area being searched in Dublin, the involvement of the Irish police (Garda\u00ed), and the release of CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.\n3.

The article states that the footage shows Mr. Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street, where he worked.\n7. The article mentions that detectives released the footage in April and appealed for the man to come forward.\n8. The article states that the man seen in the CCTV has not yet been identified and that detectives renewed their appeal for him to come forward on Saturday.\n\nBased on the information provided in the summary, it appears that the search mentioned is related to the disappearance of Trevor Deely.
