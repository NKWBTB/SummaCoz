The summary implies that a cat has died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park, as confirmed by the RSPCA.\n2. However, the article does not specifically mention that the cat died after eating antifreeze in a car park. It mentions that cats in the area had ingested a toxic substance, but the article doesn't provide details about the specific location or circumstances of the poisoning.\n3.

The article states that the RSPCA confirmed that all cats near Victor Avenue in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, had ingested a toxic substance, and that three other cats in the area have died in the last seven days, while another cat died two weeks ago.\n2. The summary states that a cat has died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park, which is consistent with the information in the article.\n3. The article quotes Adria Pearce, the owner of the deceased cat Meereen, saying that the cat came home on Friday evening and seemed to be shivering, and that she was found behind the sofa, foaming from the mouth and trying to be sick.\n4. The article also quotes RSPCA inspector Andy Bostock, who is appealing for everyone in the area to ensure pesticides and chemicals are stored safely, as they are concerned about the poisonings.\n\nBased on the above, I would answer (yes) to the question: Is the summary consistent with the corresponding article? The summary accurately summarizes the information in the article, and all the information in the summary is supported by the article."}
