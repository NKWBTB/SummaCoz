The summary states that a police community support officer has said he is \"appalled\" after a car was attacked in County Down on New Year's Day.\n2. The article states that Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said he was \"appalled by mindless attacks on PSNI officers and the Newry community\" after two cars were damaged in the Nursery Drive and Parkhead area of Newry on Friday night.\n3. The summary does not mention the location of the attack, whereas the article specifically states that it occurred in the Nursery Drive and Parkhead area of Newry.\n4. The summary does not mention the date of the attack, whereas the article states that it occurred on Friday night.\n5. The summary does not mention the number of cars damaged, whereas the article states that two cars were damaged.\n6. The summary does not mention the appeal to parents, whereas the article states that the PSNI Newry & Mourne Facebook page appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.\n\nBased on the above points, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions a single car being attacked and does not provide any additional details that are present in the article. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
