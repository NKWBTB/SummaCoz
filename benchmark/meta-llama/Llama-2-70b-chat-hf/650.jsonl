The summary states that National League side Torquay United has signed striker Myles Anderson on a two-year contract after he was released by the National League club.\n2. However, the article states that Centre-back Anderson has canceled his Barrow contract by mutual consent and is joining their National League rivals. The article does not mention any signing of Myles Anderson by Torquay United on a two-year contract. Instead, it discusses the departure of Centre-back Anderson from Barrow.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies that Torquay United signed Myles Anderson after his release, whereas the article provides information about another player, Centre-back Anderson, who canceled his contract with Barrow.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that Anderson, a centre-back, has cancelled his contract with Barrow by mutual consent to join their National League rivals, which implies that he has not been released by the club.\n2. The summary states that Anderson has been signed by Torquay United on a two-year contract after being released by the National League club, which contradicts the information in the article.\n3. The article mentions that striker Keating has been signed by Torquay United, but the summary does not mention this.\n4. The article provides additional information about the club's current situation and the manager's thoughts on the signings, which is not included in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary contains inaccuracies and omits important information, making it an inconsistent summary of the article."}
