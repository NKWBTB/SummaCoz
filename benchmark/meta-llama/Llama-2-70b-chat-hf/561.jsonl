The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that the government has confirmed that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men. Instead, the article discusses the intention to pardon gay and bisexual men who were convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, in line with England and Wales' plans for automatic pardons under 'Turing's Law.' The article mentions the process of presenting a motion in the assembly for approval, securing executive agreement, and the aim of equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary inaccurately suggesting that the pardons are specifically for those convicted of sexually abusing gay men, while the article focuses on the broader context of pardoning men convicted of abolished sexual offences.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that the motion will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, where plans for automatic pardons were announced last month.\n2. The article states that the law will allow living men convicted of such offences to apply for a pardon.\n3. The minister says that arrangements would be brought in \"as soon as possible to ensure that there is equal treatment for gay and bisexual men here as for their counterparts in England and Wales\".\n4. The summary states that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article. The article mentions that living men convicted of such offences will be able to apply for a pardon, and the minister mentions that arrangements will be brought in to ensure equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland as in England and Wales. Therefore, it can be inferred that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be eligible for pardons.\n\nYes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
