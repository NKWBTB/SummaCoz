Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions that James Browning is a former England Under-21 international, which suggests that he has some level of experience and recognition in the football world.\n2. The article states that Browning made nine appearances for Everton, which implies that he has some level of first-team experience in the Premier League.\n3. The article mentions that Browning missed the end of last season with a knee injury, which suggests that he has been out of action for a significant period of time.\n4. The article quotes Browning as saying that he hopes to make an impact at his new club and that he has heard good things about the club.\n\nNow, let's compare this information to the summary:\n\n1. The summary states that James Browning has signed for League One side Oldham Athletic on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. This is not mentioned in the article.\n2. The summary does not mention anything about Browning's experience with the England Under-21 team or his appearances for Everton.\n3. The summary does not mention anything about Browning's knee injury or his recovery from it.\n4. The summary does not quote Browning as saying anything about his hopes for his time at Oldham Athletic.\n\nBased on the above points, it is clear that the summary does not accurately represent the information in the article. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
