The article mentions that earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr. Ruto's home, but this is later clarified to be a single individual who entered the farm complex with a machete.\n4. The article reports that there were also reports of gunfire, but does not specify who was firing guns or whether anyone was hit.\n5. The article mentions that the wounded police officer was in a stable condition.\n6. The article notes that the incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative, and regional elections.\n7. The article mentions that Mr. Ruto had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta.\n8. The article mentions that President Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month.\n9. The article notes that while Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls.\n10. The article quotes experts as saying they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that a Kenyan man was shot dead during an election rally in the capital Nairobi, while the article does not mention any deaths or election rallies in Nairobi. The article only mentions an incident involving an intruder at Mr. Ruto's compound near Eldoret, which is a different location from Nairobi. Therefore, I answer (no) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
