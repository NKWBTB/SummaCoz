The article mentions that Josh Earnest, a White House official, said that closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp is a national security interest and a priority for President Obama.\n2. The article also mentions that the administration has been working on a plan to safely and responsibly close the prison, and that Congress has blocked the transfer of prisoners to the US due to bipartisan opposition.\n3.

The summary does not provide any evidence or support for this claim, and it contradicts the information provided in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.
