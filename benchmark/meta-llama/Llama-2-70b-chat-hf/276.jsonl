Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade.

The article states that migrants from outside the EU will be required to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK. The summary does not mention this specific requirement.\n2. The article mentions that the new measures will be rolled out in the summer, but the summary does not provide this detail.\n3. The article explains that the certificate will disclose whether the applicant has a clean criminal record or has committed offenses. The summary does not mention this aspect of the certificate.\n4. The article provides exceptions to the requirement, including visitors, those under 18, asylum seekers, and cases where it is not practicable. The summary does not mention these exceptions.\n\nBased on these differences, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary omits important details and does not accurately represent the full scope of the new measures described in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
