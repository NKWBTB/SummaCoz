The article mentions that Keating has previously had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United, and Finn Harps, and the summary does not mention this.\n8. The article mentions that Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon that Myles (Anderson) is the leader-type he's been after, and the summary does not mention this.\n9. The article mentions that the Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, and have won only one of their last six games, and the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the signing of Scott Anderson, while the article provides additional information about Anderson's background, Keating's recommendation, and the club's current performance. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
