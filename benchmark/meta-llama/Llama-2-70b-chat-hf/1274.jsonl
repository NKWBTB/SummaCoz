The summary, however, only mentions that Barbara Kemp has returned to EastEnders for a second time, without providing any additional context.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article, as it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. The summary should have included more details about the storyline and the return of Ross Kemp as Grant Mitchell."}
