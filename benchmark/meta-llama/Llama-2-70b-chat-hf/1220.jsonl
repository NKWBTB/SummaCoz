The summary mentions that the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that a celebrity who wants to publish details of an alleged sexual relationship with another celebrity in order to be banned from being named in the media.\n3.

The article mentions that an interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing, while the summary does not mention anything about an interim injunction.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article.

Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
