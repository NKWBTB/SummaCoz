The article mentions that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n3. The article provides information about Storey's past achievements, including her status as Britain's most decorated female Paralympian with 22 medals, her 11 gold, eight silver, and three bronze medals, and her success in both cycling and swimming across six Paralympics. None of this information is mentioned in the summary.\n4.
