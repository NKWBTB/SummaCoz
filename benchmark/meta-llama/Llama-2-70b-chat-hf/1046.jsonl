The article states that Fawzi al-Odah, a Kuwaiti citizen, was released from Guantanamo Bay and flew to Kuwait on a Kuwaiti government plane.\n3.

The article mentions that Fawzi al-Odah was released from Guantanamo Bay and transferred to Kuwait.\n2. The summary mentions that a former Guantanamo Bay detainee has been released from Kuwait.\n3. The article states that Mr. Odah was released after a US review panel determined that he no longer posed a significant threat to US security.\n4. The summary does not mention the reason for Mr. Odah's release.\n5. The article mentions that Mr. Odah will face at least a year at a militant rehabilitation center in Kuwait as part of the terms of his release.\n6. The summary does not mention the rehabilitation center or any conditions of Mr. Odah's release.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While it does mention that a former Guantanamo Bay detainee has been released from Kuwait, it does not provide any additional details or context that are present in the article. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
