The article mentions that a shooting occurred at a hostel attached to a private school in Bangalore city, and the summary reports that a 19-year-old Indian student was shot dead at a school in Bangalore. Both sources agree on the location of the incident.\n2. The article identifies the alleged gunman as Mahesh, who was working as an office assistant in the school, and the summary does not provide any conflicting information about the suspect.\n3. The article mentions that incidents of gun crime at schools and colleges in India are rare, and the summary does not suggest otherwise.\n4. The article reports that Mahesh was remanded until April 12, and the summary does not mention anything about the suspect's legal status.\n5. The article describes how Mahesh allegedly barged into a room and shot two students, one of whom died, and the summary reports that a 19-year-old student was shot dead.\n6. The article mentions a previous incident of a schoolboy being shot dead near Delhi in 2007, but the summary does not mention this. However, this does not contradict the summary, as it only provides additional context.\n\nTherefore, the summary accurately summarizes the information provided in the article, and the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
