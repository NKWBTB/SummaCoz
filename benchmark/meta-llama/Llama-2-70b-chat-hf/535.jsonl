The summary implies that an 18th-century museum in London is reopening as part of an art collection campaign.\n2.

The article states that the Wedgwood Museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire, was at risk of selling its collection to pay off a pension debt.\n2. The summary mentions an 18th century museum in London, but does not mention the Wedgwood Museum or its location in Staffordshire.\n3. The summary mentions a campaign to save the museum's collection from being sold at auction, but does not mention the specific reason for the campaign (i.e., the pension debt).\n4. The summary does not mention the Art Fund or the Victoria and Albert Museum, which are key players in the campaign to save the Wedgwood Museum's collection.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not accurately represent the information in the article, and leaves out important details about the location and context of the museum and its collection."}
