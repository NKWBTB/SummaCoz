Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that Nimes will be relegated at the end of the season, and the summary correctly reflects this information.\n2. The article mentions that Jean-Marc Conrad, Nimes' former president, was found guilty of trying to fix matches, and the summary also includes this information.\n3. The article specifies that Conrad tried to fix four matches as his team fought off relegation, and the summary accurately summarizes this detail.\n4. The article mentions that seven games involving Nimes were investigated, and the summary notes that seven games were arrested last November. Although the wording is different, the information is consistent.\n5. The article reports that Conrad was banned from football-related activities for seven years, and the summary includes this information.\n6. The article mentions that preliminary charges of corruption have been filed against Caen president Jean-Francois Fortin and Conrad, but the summary does not include this detail. However, this omission does not make the summary inconsistent with the article.\n7. Finally, the article states that Nimes can appeal the sanction, but the summary does not mention this. Again, the absence of this information does not make the summary inconsistent with the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
