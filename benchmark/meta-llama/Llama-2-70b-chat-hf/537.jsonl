The summary implies that Sutton United has signed Akil Wright on a two-year deal.\n2. However, the article states that Akil Wright potentially purchases 20% of Billericay and becomes a club director.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests that Akil Wright has signed with Sutton United on a two-year deal, while the article discusses Akil Wright's potential involvement with Billericay Football Club and becoming a club director.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Akil Wright is set to join Billericay, not Sutton United.\n2. The article does not mention anything about a two-year deal for Wright.\n3. The article does mention that Wright will become a club director, but it does not specify which club.\n4. The article does not mention Sutton United at all.\n\nBased on the above points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary claims that Sutton United have agreed a deal to sign Akil Wright on a two-year deal, but the article does not support this claim.
