The summary states that the girl set herself on fire using kerosene on Tuesday, according to a neighbour, which is consistent with the article's statement that the girl set herself on fire using kerosene, according to NDTV.\n4. The article provides additional information about the girl's condition, the arrest of the accused men, and the heightened sensitivity to sexual assault in India, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n\nTherefore, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, and the information in the summary is supported by the article."}
