The article mentions that Anderson, a centre-back, has cancelled his contract with Barrow by mutual consent to join their National League rivals, which implies that he has not been released by the club.\n2. The article does not mention anything about Anderson signing a two-year contract with Torquay United.\n3. The article does mention that striker Keating, 21, has been signed by Torquay United on a permanent deal, subject to international clearance.\n4. The article quotes Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson as saying that Myles (presumably Anderson) is the leader-type he's been after, which suggests that Anderson may have been signed to provide leadership on the pitch.\n5. The article does not mention anything about Anderson's contract duration or salary.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While it does mention that Anderson has joined Torquay United, it incorrectly states that he was released by his previous club and signed a two-year contract with Torquay. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
