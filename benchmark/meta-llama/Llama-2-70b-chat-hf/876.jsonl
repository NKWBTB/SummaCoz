{"document": "Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known\u00a0as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

However, the article provides information about septum piercing, but it does not mention the process as \"severing the wall between the two cheeks.\" Instead, it briefly discusses the historical and cultural significance of septum piercing in various regions and its modern use as a fashion trend. The summary's statement about the process of septum piercing is not accurately supported by the article.\n3.

The article mentions that the septum piercing is a trend that strikes fear into the hearts of women, and that it has been adopted by several celebrities.\n2. The article explains that the septum piercing is a process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils, and that it has been used for various purposes in different cultures, such as a coming-of-age ritual, a status symbol, and a way to control and handle bulls.\n3. The article mentions that the septum ring is also known as the \"bull-ring piercing,\" which suggests that it is used for controlling and handling bulls.\n4. However, the article also states that in the UK, America, and Australia, the septum piercing is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. The summary mentions that the septum piercing is used for controlling and handling bulls, but the article does not provide any information to support this claim. While the article does mention that the septum ring is also known as the \"bull-ring piercing,\" it does not explain why or how it is used for controlling and handling bulls.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
