The summary mentions that a collection of art worth more than \u00a3100,000 has been donated to a County Durham museum.\n2. However, the article states that the collection was facing auction to help pay off the pottery firm's pension debt, and that the Art Fund led a public fundraising campaign to save the collection. \n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly states that the collection has been donated to a county Durham museum, while the article does not mention any donation of the collection to a county Durham museum.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that the collection is worth over \u00a3100,000, while the summary states that it is worth more than \u00a3100,000. This is consistent.\n2. The article states that the collection includes works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters, and photographs. The summary does not mention the specific types of items included in the collection, but it does refer to \"art.\" This is consistent.\n3. The article states that the collection was at risk of being sold and scattered around the globe before the public fundraising campaign was launched. The summary does not mention this detail. However, it does state that the collection has been donated to a county Durham museum, which implies that it has been saved from being sold. This is consistent.\n4. The article states that the collection will remain on display at the Wedgwood Museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire, before being loaned to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The summary does not mention the specific museums involved. However, it does state that the collection has been donated to a county Durham museum, which is consistent with the article's mention of the Wedgwood Museum.\n5. The article quotes Alison Wedgwood and Tristram Hunt MP, who express their relief and gratitude at the successful fundraising campaign. The summary does not include any quotes or references to specific individuals. However, this does not necessarily mean that the summary is inconsistent with the article.\n\nBased on the above points, I would say that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, including the value of the collection, the types of items included, and the fact that the collection has been donated to a museum.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
