The summary states that Barcelona has rejected a deal to sign Barcelona striker Neymar from Barcelona for \u00a348.6 million.\n2. However, the article does not mention that Barcelona rejected a deal to sign Neymar from Barcelona. Instead, the article discusses the transfer of Neymar from Santos to Barcelona for a fee of \u00a348.6 million. It provides details about the transfer, including the amounts paid and the tax-related issues surrounding the transfer. It does not mention Barcelona trying to sign Neymar from themselves.\n3.
