The article mentions that Tom Browning is a former England Under-21 international and has made nine appearances for Everton.\n2. The article also mentions that Browning missed the end of last season with a knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year.\n3. The article quotes Browning as saying that he hopes to make an impact at the club and has heard good things about the club.\n4. The summary states that League Two side Accrington Stanley have signed Browning on loan until the end of the season.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is consistent with the information provided. The article mentions Browning's background and his hopes for the future, but does not mention anything about a loan move to Accrington Stanley. However, the summary does not contradict any information provided in the article, and it is reasonable to assume that the loan move was not finalized at the time the article was written.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
