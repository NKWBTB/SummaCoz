The summary states that the new owners of Bernard Matthews have said they believe a new pension scheme will be changed.\n2. However, the article does not mention any intention or need to change the pension scheme. In fact, the article emphasizes that the new owner, Ranjit Boparan, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that there will be changes to the pension scheme under the new ownership, while the article explicitly states that the current pension arrangements will be honored and continued without any changes.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that the new owners, Boparan Private Office, have confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews will continue under the new ownership.\n2. The Unite regional officer, Steve Harley, is quoted as saying that the new owners have given guarantees that all current agreements will be honored.\n3. The article also mentions that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004, and that its members currently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected by the takeover.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the new owners have given assurances that the existing pension arrangements will be maintained, and that there are no plans to change the pension scheme. Therefore, the summary statement that the new owners have said they are \"confident\" a new pension scheme will be changed is not consistent with the information in the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
