Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that the boat capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug, which is located in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. The summary correctly mentions that the incident occurred off the Dumfries and Galloway coast.\n2. The article mentions that there were three people on the boat, believed to be teenagers, and that one of them made it ashore while the other two were stranded on an island in the river. The summary correctly states that three teenagers were rescued after their boat capsized.\n3. The article states that the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service initially said that efforts were being made to reach the two stranded teenagers. The summary does not mention this, but it does state that the teenagers were later rescued by boat, which is consistent with the article.\n4. The article mentions that the alert was raised shortly after 13:45. The summary does not mention the exact time, but it does state that the incident occurred during the day.\n\nBased on the above, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article. Yes, the summary accurately summarizes the information in the article."}
