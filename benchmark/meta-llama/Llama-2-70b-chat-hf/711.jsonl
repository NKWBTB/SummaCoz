The article primarily discusses the restoration of Alexandra Palace's theatre, which is located in North London, and the funds allocated for this project.\n3.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that the theatre, founded in 1875, will be restored and used for various performances, including theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music.\n2. The summary mentions that a \u00a31.8m restoration project is to be launched to transform the east end of Haringey theatre into a theatre. This is consistent with the article's mention of the theatre's restoration.\n3. The article states that the theatre has languished unused for decades, which aligns with the summary's mention of the theatre being restored.\n4. The article mentions that the restoration project is part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination. The summary does not mention this, but it does not contradict it either.\n5. The article mentions that the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) is contributing \u00a318.8m towards the project, while Haringey Council is contributing \u00a36.8m. The summary does not mention the specific amounts, but it does mention that the project costs \u00a326.6m, which is consistent with the article's mention of the total cost.\n6. The article mentions that the Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust have committed to raising the final \u00a31m by summer 2017. The summary does not mention this, but it does not contradict it either.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
