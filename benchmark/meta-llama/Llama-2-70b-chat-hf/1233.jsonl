The article mentions that McBryde will assume head coach responsibilities for the third time, leading Wales on tours in 2009 and 2013.\n2. The article also mentions that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) will appoint assistant coaches for the summer tour to assist McBryde.\n3. The article quotes WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips as saying that they are at an advanced stage in discussions with a number of other individuals about the summer tour and hope to confirm the full make-up of the management team next week.\n4. The article also quotes Union chairman Gareth Davies as saying that the involvement of Welsh coaches will benefit the national team.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that McBryde has been appointed as the head coach for the Welsh Rugby Union, and that the WRU is in the process of appointing assistant coaches to work with him. The article does not mention anything about the WRU appointing a new coach, and it seems that McBryde is simply assuming head coach responsibilities for the third time.\n\nTherefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it incorrectly states that the WRU has appointed new coaches. The correct summary would be that McBryde has been appointed as the head coach for the Welsh Rugby Union, and that the WRU is in the process of appointing assistant coaches to work with him.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
