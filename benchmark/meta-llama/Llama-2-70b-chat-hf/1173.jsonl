The article mentions that J.K. Rowling faced criticism on Twitter for her political views, specifically for her donation to the campaign against Scottish independence.\n2. The article also mentions that Rowling had blocked some abusive Twitter users who were supporters of the Scottish National Party (SNP).\n3. The article quotes Rowling as saying that she feels no responsibility to hide the abusive behavior of some SNP supporters to protect the image of the party.\n4. The article also mentions that Rowling had a positive exchange with some SNP supporters on Twitter, discussing their shared political views.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it seems that J.K. Rowling was the one who faced abuse on Twitter, and she responded by blocking the abusive users and speaking out against their behavior. The SNP is not mentioned as having responded to Rowling's tweets or taken any action to address the abuse she faced.\n\nTherefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it suggests that the SNP was the party that was hit back at, when in fact it was Rowling who was facing abuse and responding to it.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
