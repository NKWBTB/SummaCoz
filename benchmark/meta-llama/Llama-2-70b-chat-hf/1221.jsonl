The summary mentions the death of \"singer rodton jackson\" at the age of 90.\n2. The article reports the death of Rod Temperton, a songwriter, at the age of 66.\n3. The summary refers to the deceased as a singer, while the article identifies Temperton as a songwriter.\n4. The age of the deceased in the summary (90) differs from the age reported in the article (66).\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
