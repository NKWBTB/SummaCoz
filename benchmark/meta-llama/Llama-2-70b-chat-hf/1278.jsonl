The article mentions that O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the \"widow maker\" in her blog entry.\n8. The summary does not mention anything about the type of attack or O'Donnell's blog entry.\n9. The article mentions that O'Donnell hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network, but the show was cancelled due to low ratings.\n10. The summary does not mention anything about O'Donnell's hosting job or the cancellation of the show.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not provide enough information and leaves out several important details that are mentioned in the article."}
