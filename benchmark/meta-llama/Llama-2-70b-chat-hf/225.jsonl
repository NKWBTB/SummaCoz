Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Marcos Lopes is on a season-long loan with Lille from Manchester City. The summary also mentions this fact.\n2. The article quotes Lopes as saying that he would be keen to stay with Lille beyond the end of the season if he is not sure of regular playing time back at Manchester City. The summary accurately summarizes this quote.\n3. The article states that Lopes has made 19 appearances in all competitions for Lille, and the summary mentions that he is yet to appear in a Premier League match for City.\n4. The article mentions that Lopes has revealed he is enjoying his loan spell at Lille. The summary also mentions this fact.\n5. The only piece of information in the summary that is not explicitly mentioned in the article is the statement that Marcos Rojo will be keen to stay with the Ligue 1 club. However, this can be inferred from the quote from Lopes mentioned in point 2, as he says \"I feel really good now. I feel more responsibility. This is important, because it means they believe in me.\" This suggests that Lopes is happy with his situation at Lille and would be interested in staying longer.\n\nTherefore, all the information in the summary is supported by the article, and the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
