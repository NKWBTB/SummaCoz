The summary implies that a prison official has stated that drones could be used to smuggle drugs into a prison.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication.

The article mentions a former inmate claiming that drones were used but notes that the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site.\n3.

The summary states that a prison official has said that drones could be used to smuggle drugs into a prison.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it seems that the claim about drones being used to smuggle contraband into Chelmsford Prison is unsubstantiated, as the Ministry of Justice spokeswoman denies any evidence of drones coming into the prison.
