The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that St Mirren has signed striker Jeremy Clarkson on a season-long loan from Dundee.\n2. However, the article does not mention any transfer of Jeremy Clarkson to St Mirren. Instead, the article discusses a player named Clarkson (without specifying the first name) who joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship. The player in question appears to be a footballer, not the well-known TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary assumes Jeremy Clarkson, the TV presenter, has been signed by St Mirren, while the article discusses a different individual who is a footballer.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, which contradicts the summary's statement that St Mirren signed him on a season-long loan from Dundee.\n2. The article does not mention anything about a loan deal, but rather states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell.\n3. The summary does not provide any information about Clarkson's previous teams, whereas the article mentions that his previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about Clarkson's international career, whereas the article states that he has been capped twice for Scotland and has one international goal to his name.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary provides incomplete and inaccurate information, and therefore, the answer is no."}
