Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Wanda Campbell was jailed for three years, and the summary also mentions that she was jailed for three years.\n2. The article states that Campbell was ordered to pay compensation of \u00a3110,000, and the summary mentions that she was ordered to pay more than \u00a3110,000.\n3. The article mentions that Campbell's appeal against her sentence and conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh, and the summary does not mention anything about an appeal.\n4. The article states that Campbell was found guilty of acting with others to take money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013, and the summary mentions that she was convicted of conspiring to steal more than \u00a3110,000 from a Dumfries castle.\n\nBased on the above points, it appears that the summary accurately summarizes the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
