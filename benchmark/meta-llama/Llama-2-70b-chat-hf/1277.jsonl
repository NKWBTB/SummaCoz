The summary states that vlogtarter has released details of its latest version of rocks.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about vlogstarter nor rocks.\n3.

The article mentions Rockstar, not \"vlogtarter,\" as the company releasing the game.\n2. The article states that the game's release has been delayed until March 24th, whereas the summary mentions no such delay.\n3. The article mentions that the game requires additional testing and polish, whereas the summary does not mention this.\n4. The article mentions the release of screenshots from the PC version of GTA V, whereas the summary does not mention this.\n5. The article mentions the minimum specifications required to run GTA V, whereas the summary does not mention this.\n6. The article mentions the game's previous success, becoming the fastest-selling entertainment product ever, whereas the summary does not mention this.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
