The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that the council has said that businesses and businesses on the Isle of Wight are to be allowed to free up the new chain ferry.\n2. However, the article discusses the issues and challenges faced by the new chain ferry on the Isle of Wight, including breakdowns, grounding, and suspension by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It mentions that the council has made the Cowes crossing free until 2 July for various reasons, but it doesn't explicitly state that this is to \"free up\" businesses.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary implying that the council's decision to make the ferry crossing free is primarily aimed at benefiting businesses, while the article provides a broader context of the ferry's problems and the council's response without specifying that the decision is solely for the benefit of businesses.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that the council has allowed the free use of the new chain ferry for a limited time, specifically until July 2nd, in recognition of the problems faced by the ferry and to gather feedback.\n2. The article also mentions that the council has ordered a review of the project by auditors, indicating that they are taking steps to address the issues.\n3. The article quotes a local shopkeeper who expresses concerns about the impact of the ferry's problems on her business and asks if the council will provide compensation for local businesses, similar to the compensation for damaged cars.\n4. The article also quotes a transport councillor who acknowledges that there have been teething problems with the ferry but downplays the issues, saying that they are normal for a prototype and that the council has taken steps to address them, such as authorizing the manufacture of ramp extensions.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the council is taking steps to address the problems faced by the new chain ferry and is allowing free use of the ferry for a limited time. Therefore, the summary that businesses on the Isle of Wight are to be allowed to use the new chain ferry for free is consistent with the information in the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
