{"document": "Outspoken MP Bob Katter has risked being drawn into a race row after accusing the Queensland Government of believing embattled MP Billy Gordon was 'a little black puppet on a string'. In a bizarre statement on his party's website, Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past. Mr Katter, federal MP for Kennedy, is of Lebanese descent. He said he's been personally subjected to racist attitudes from both major parties in the past, and that he sympathised with Mr Gordon's position. Federal MP Bob Katter, who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence .

'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament, there was never any question raised about the member resigning. So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign?'

The article reports that Bob Katter made a statement accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon, an MP who is Aboriginal, was \"a little black puppet on a string.\"\n2. The article also mentions that Mr. Katter is of Lebanese descent and has personally experienced racist attitudes from both major parties in the past.\n3. The article quotes Mr. Katter as saying that he used the term \"black puppet\" in light of his personal experiences and to highlight the racial overtones of the situation.\n4. The summary, on the other hand, focuses on the phrase \"black puppet on a string\" and suggests that Mr. Katter's statement was bizarre and potentially offensive.\n5. The summary does not mention the context of Mr. Katter's statement or his personal experiences with racism, which are important factors in understanding his motivations for using that phrase.\n\nBased on these points, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not accurately represent the content and context of Mr. Katter's statement, and it could be misleading for readers who have not read the full article."}
