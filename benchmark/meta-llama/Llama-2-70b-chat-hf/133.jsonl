The summary implies that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday, and the tower itself did not have significant damage, and the fire was halted around midnight.\n2. However, the article states that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday in the bell tower, specifically in the wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower as it undergoes restoration. The article mentions that the emergencies ministry for Moscow reported the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, and the fire's spread had been halted around midnight. The summary incorrectly mentions that the blaze broke out at the convent and in wooden scaffolding without specifying the bell tower. This creates a factual inconsistency.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary does not specify that the blaze occurred in the bell tower of the Novodevichy Convent and incorrectly attributes the lack of significant damage to the entire convent, not just the tower.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The summary states that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday, which is consistent with the article's statement that the fire broke out last night.\n2. The summary mentions that the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, which is consistent with the article's statement that the emergencies ministry for Moscow said the tower itself did not suffer significant damage.\n3. The summary states that the fire's spread had been halted around midnight, which is consistent with the article's statement that the emergency ministry said the fire's spread had been halted around midnight.\n4. The summary does not mention the cause of the fire, which is not specified in the article either.\n5. The summary does not mention any specific details about the convent's history or significance, which are provided in the article but are not essential to the summary's main points.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.\n\nYes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
