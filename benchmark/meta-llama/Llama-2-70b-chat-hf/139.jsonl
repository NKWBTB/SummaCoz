When Gerardine Stockford, 53, phoned customer services an employee told her that it must be a blocked word, according to The Sunday Times. Lord Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, was shocked.

However, the article states that 'Jesus Christ' and 'Christ' are included in the list of banned words to prevent their misuse, but it does not mention that a customer was stopped from buying a bouquet with these words. The article provides a specific example of a customer being prevented from completing the order due to mentioning 'Christ Church Teddington' in the gift message.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that a customer was stopped from buying a bouquet because of the banned words 'Jesus Christ,' while the article states that the specific incident involved the mention of 'Christ Church Teddington' in the gift message, not just the words 'Jesus Christ.'\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions that 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' are on a list of banned words by Marks & Spencer. The article confirms this by stating that these words cannot be used in gift messages and provides an example of a customer being prevented from completing their order because of this policy.\n2. The summary mentions that other banned words include 'f***', 'gay', and 'terrorist'. The article also mentions these words as being on the list of banned words.\n3. The summary mentions that some terms, including 'jihad', 'Buddha', and 'Allah', are accepted. The article does not explicitly mention these words, but it does state that the policy includes hundreds of words of varying nature, which suggests that some words may be allowed while others are not.\n4. The summary states that the policy emerged after one customer was stopped from buying a \u00a335 bouquet. The article provides the same example and adds that the customer was prevented from completing their order because of the banned words policy.\n5. The summary does not mention any specific reaction from Marks & Spencer or any other individuals. The article, on the other hand, includes a statement from a spokesperson for Marks & Spencer explaining the reasoning behind the policy and a reaction from Lord Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, who expresses his shock at the policy.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, and all the information in the summary is supported by the article. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
