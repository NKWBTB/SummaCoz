The article confirms that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews will continue under the new ownership.\n6. The article mentions that the new owner, Mr. Boparan, wishes to restore Bernard Matthews to its former position as a highly profitable business.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article.
