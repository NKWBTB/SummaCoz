Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary states that Newcastle have made initial moves to sign Marseille striker Andre Ayew, which is supported by the article's statement that Newcastle have made an initial approach for Ayew.\n2. The summary mentions that Ayew is out of contract in the summer, which is also stated in the article.\n3. The summary notes that Roma and Everton have asked to be kept informed about Ayew's situation, which is consistent with the article's statement that Tottenham, Everton, and Roma have expressed interest in the player.\n4. The summary reports that Ayew has netted six times for Marseille this season, which is supported by the article's statement that Ayew has scored six times for Marseille this season.\n5. The summary does not mention anything about FC Sion striker Moussa Konate, which is not inconsistent with the article as the article only mentions Konate in passing as another player wanted by several European clubs.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
