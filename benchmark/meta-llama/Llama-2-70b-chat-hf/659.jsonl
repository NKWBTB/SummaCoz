However, the article provides information about the cast of Disney's live-action adaptation of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" It mentions Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad, along with their respective roles. There is no mention of \"Daisy Potts\" in the article, and the article does not connect \"star wars actress\" to any character in the movie.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, where it introduces a character named \"Daisy Potts\" and associates her with \"star wars actress,\" which is not supported by the article. The actual cast and characters are different, and the article does not mention any actress by that name in relation to \"Beauty and the Beast.\"\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that the star, who is not named in the summary, will play Mrs. Potts, a character that was voiced by Dame Angela Lansbury in the 1991 animated version of the film.\n2.
