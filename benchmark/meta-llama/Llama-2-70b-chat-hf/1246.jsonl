The article states that the incident took place at the Mohammed V stadium, which is located in Morocco, not London.\n2.

The article mentions 31 people being arrested for \"acts of vandalism,\" but the summary does not mention any specific number of arrests.\n4. The article mentions a fine of 100,000 dirhams (\u00a37,170) being imposed on the club, but the summary mentions a fine of \u00a37,000.\n5. The article mentions an inquiry being opened by prosecutors, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The information in the summary is not fully supported by the information in the article, and there are some inaccuracies and omissions.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
