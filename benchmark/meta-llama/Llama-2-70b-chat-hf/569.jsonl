The article provides details about the location of the incident, the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and other incidents in Sheffield but does not mention the victim's age.\n3. The inconsistency arises from the error in the summary, which inaccurately states the age of the victim as 23 years old and specifies that the shooting occurred outside a house, while the article provides a more general description of the location without mentioning the victim's age.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The article reports a shooting outside a house in Sheffield, and the summary mentions a 23-year-old man dying from a shooting in Sheffield.\n2.
