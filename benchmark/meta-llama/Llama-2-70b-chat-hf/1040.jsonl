The article mentions that the boy was injured in an incident in Coatbridge, and the summary reports that the boy was hit by a car in North Lanarkshire, which is a region that includes Coatbridge.\n2. The article specifies that the incident occurred on Bank Street near Langloan Primary School, and the summary does not provide any conflicting information about the location.\n3. The article states that the boy was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, and the summary mentions that the boy was taken to hospital, without specifying the location of the hospital.\n4. The article describes the boy's condition as serious, and the summary does not provide any contradictory information about the boy's condition.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article, the summary is consistent with the article, and the answer is yes."}
