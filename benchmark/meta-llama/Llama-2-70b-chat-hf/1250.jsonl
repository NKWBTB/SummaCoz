The summary mentions a plan to demolish a five-storey hotel. However, there is no mention of \"a five-storey hotel\".

The article mentions that three hotels will be demolished to make way for a new six-storey hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks.\n2. The summary only mentions the demolition of a five-storey hotel, without mentioning the other two hotels that will also be demolished.\n3. The article states that the new development will include a 90-room hotel and 122 assisted-living apartments, while the summary does not provide this information.\n4. The article mentions that English Heritage objected to the scale of the development, while the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the demolition of a five-storey hotel, without providing the full context of the development plan, which includes the demolition of three hotels and the construction of a new hotel and assisted-living apartment blocks. Additionally, the summary does not mention the opposition from English Heritage.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
