The summary implies that the former Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has stated that he does not want to quit the party.\n2. However, the article does not provide a direct statement from Mike Nesbitt about quitting the party. Instead, the article discusses his comments about the upcoming election, his preference for working with the SDLP, and his confidence in his position within the party.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces the idea of Mike Nesbitt quitting the party, which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article reports on Mike Nesbitt's speech launching the Ulster Unionist Party's manifesto, where he made comments about preferring to go into Stormont Castle with the SDLP rather than Sinn F\u00e9in.\n2. The article mentions that Nesbitt's comments sparked controversy and that he was asked about them during a question-and-answer session with journalists.\n3. Nesbitt is quoted as saying that he wouldn't withdraw a word of what he said and that he was thinking only of what would happen after the election.\n4. The article highlights Nesbitt's call for the election to be a referendum on how the Renewable Heat Incentive debacle was handled.\n5. The article also mentions that the Ulster Unionist Party's manifesto includes various policy proposals, such as tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers, and standing up for the LGBT community.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the summary \"the former ulster unionist leader mike nesbitt has said he does not want to quit the party\" is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about Nesbitt wanting to quit the party, and in fact, suggests that he is confident in his position and the party's manifesto. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
