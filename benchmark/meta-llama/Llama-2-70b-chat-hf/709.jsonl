The summary states that the theatre is to reopen its doors for the first time in more than 50 years.\n3. The article mentions that the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music.\n4.

The article mentions that the theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.\n8. The summary does not mention the larger restoration project or the planned use of the theatre as part of a new cultural destination.\n9. The article mentions that the glazed east court will become a space for the public and for exhibitions.\n10. The summary does not mention the glazed east court or its planned use.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article in that it mentions the theatre's planned reopening and the fact that it has been unused for decades. However, the summary does not provide any additional information or details about the theatre's planned use or the larger restoration project. Therefore, I would answer (yes) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
