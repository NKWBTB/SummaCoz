The article focuses on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line, which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK.\n2. The article mentions that the line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms.\n3. The article quotes Network Rail saying that the study would be \"key\" to long-term developments.\n4. The article mentions that the report, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, said that 10% of journeys on the line could be affected by 2040.\n5. The article mentions that the academics who conducted the study identified a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years.\n6. The article quotes Dr David Dawson, from the University of Leeds, saying the long-term future of the line was \"really worrying\".\n7. The article mentions that the report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds.\n8. The article mentions that Network Rail said it hoped to develop \"long-term interventions\" to \"secure the future\" of the line.\n9. The article mentions that the Department for Transport said it had invested \u00a331m into improving the resilience of the route and was \"exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area\".\n10. The article mentions that the prime minister backed a new Okehampton railway route as the \"most resilient\" alternative to the vulnerable Dawlish line.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the study is focused on the impact of sea level rises on the Dawlish to Teignmouth line and the potential for diverting routes to mitigate this impact. The article does not mention anything about the long-term future of the main rail line between London and the south of England. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
