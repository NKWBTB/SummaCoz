Instead, it discusses Morocco's past issues related to the 2015 Nations Cup and their participation in the 2017 Nations Cup qualifying draw. The article mentions the reduction of a fine imposed on Morocco's FA by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but does not indicate a postponement of hosting the 2017 event.\n3.
