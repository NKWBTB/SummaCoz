The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary mentions the Women's Equality Commission as EHRC. However, EHRC is \"The Equality and Human Rights Commission\" in the article.\n2. The summary states that the EHRC criticized the company for its \"controversial'sexism' campaign\", but the article does not mention a campaign. Instead, it reports on the company's job advertisements that have been criticized for being sexist and discriminatory.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article reports the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) criticizing Matching Models for their job advertisements, specifically the requirement of a \"classic look\" and \"b-c cup\" for a personal assistant.\n2. The EHRC chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, is quoted as saying that the agency's practices are \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women\".\n3. Women's equality campaigners also criticize the agency's ads, calling them \"straight out of the 1970s\".\n4. Employment lawyer James Lynas comments that the advertisement is \"clearly unlawful\" and that anyone could complain to the EHRC, who have powers to intervene.\n5. The article mentions that the agency's website includes another job advertisement for a \"sexy female driver\" to drive a Porsche Cayenne for a Knightsbridge-based businessman and polo team owner.\n6. The agency's founder, Nathalie Jansen, defends the ads, saying that \"looks are important\" to their clients.\n7. Jansen also mentions that they have hired 5,000 people worldwide and that MTV wanted models with tattoos and piercings.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has criticized Matching Models for their job advertisements, specifically the requirement of a \"classic look\" and \"b-c cup\" for a personal assistant. The EHRC and women's equality campaigners have called the ads \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women\". Employment lawyer James Lynas has also commented that the advertisement is \"clearly unlawful\". Therefore, the summary that the EHRC has criticized the company behind its controversial \"sexism\" campaign is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
