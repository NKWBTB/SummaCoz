Knottingley is located in West Yorkshire, while East Yorkshire is a nearby county.\n4. The discrepancy in location names could be due to a minor error or a difference in how the location is commonly referred to.\n5. The rest of the information in the summary, such as the company behind the project, the expected electricity production, and the creation of jobs, matches the information in the article.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, I would answer (yes) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The minor discrepancy in location names does not detract from the overall accuracy of the summary."}
