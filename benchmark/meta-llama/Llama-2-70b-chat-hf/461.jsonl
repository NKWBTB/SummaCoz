The summary implies that Isle of Wight Council leader Andrew Cowes is \"disappointed\" about a meeting with the council leader being suspended.\n2. However, the article does not mention Isle of Wight Council leader Andrew Cowes, and there is no information about a meeting being suspended in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a fictional scenario involving a meeting being suspended and attributes statements to individuals not mentioned in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that the council leader, Dave Stewart, said the crossing at Cowes would be free until July 2nd.\n2. The article also mentions that the council had ordered a review of the project by auditors.\n3. The article quotes a shopkeeper, Angie Booth, who expresses concerns about the impact of the ferry's problems on local businesses.\n4. The article mentions that transport councillor Ian Ward said compensation for local businesses was up for discussion.\n5. The article does not mention anything about the council leader, Andrew Cowes, being disappointed or a meeting being suspended.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about Andrew Cowes or a suspended meeting, and the focus of the article is on the problems with the new ferry and the council's response to those problems. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
