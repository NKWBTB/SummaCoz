The article mentions the name of the deceased, Kim Clark, and her age, 45. The summary only mentions the age of the deceased, 18, which does not match the information in the article.\n2. The article states that the incident occurred in Milnathort, which is not in East London. The summary claims that the incident occurred in East London, which is not consistent with the information in the article.\n3. The article mentions that the family of the deceased is upset and that inquiries into the circumstances of the incident are ongoing. The summary does not mention these details.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
