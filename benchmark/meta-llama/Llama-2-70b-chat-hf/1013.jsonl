The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that Google has pledged $1 billion to research and development of artificial intelligence (AI).\n2. However, the article does not mention Google at all. Instead, it talks about a venture called OpenAI, which is backed by several companies and individuals, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that OpenAI, a venture backed by several prominent investors including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, aims to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity without being constrained by the need to generate financial returns.\n2. The article also mentions that scientists have warned about the potential threat of AI to humanity, with Musk and Stephen Hawking expressing concerns about its potential to supersede humans.\n3. However, the article also notes that other experts argue that the risk of AI posing a threat to humans remains remote.\n4. The article states that OpenAI's research will be free from financial obligations and will focus on having a positive human impact.\n5. The article mentions that only a tiny fraction of the $1bn pledged will be spent in the next few years.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary mentions that Google has pledged $1bn to research AI, which is consistent with the article's mention of OpenAI's $1bn pledge. Additionally, the summary's mention of AI research being conducted without financial obligations and with a focus on positive human impact aligns with the article's description of OpenAI's goals.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
