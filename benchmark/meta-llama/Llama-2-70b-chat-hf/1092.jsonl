The article mentions that Mooney had a previous stint at Wycombe and Oxford City, but there is no mention of him playing for Oldham Athletic.\n3. The article states that Mooney has only made five appearances for Alfreton Town, which suggests that he has not been with the club for a significant amount of time, contrary to the two-year deal mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the information provided in the article.
