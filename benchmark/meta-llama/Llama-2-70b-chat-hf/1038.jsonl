The article mentions that Lance Corporal Trimaan \"Harry\" Dhillon fatally attacked Alice Ruggles, and that her parents, Sue Hills and Clive Ruggles, set up the Alice Ruggles Trust to raise awareness about the dangers of stalking.\n2. The summary, however, states that a mother who was murdered by a soldier has been jailed for three years.\n3. The summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, as the mother in question (Alice Ruggles) was not the one who was jailed, but rather the victim of the murder.\n4. Additionally, the summary implies that the soldier who committed the murder (Dhillon) was jailed for three years, which is not accurate, as he was sentenced to a minimum of 22 years.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
