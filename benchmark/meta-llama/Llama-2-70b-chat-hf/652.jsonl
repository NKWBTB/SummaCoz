The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that a horse died after being hit by a horse in Cheltenham, as per what a trainer has said.\n2. However, the article reports that the horse, named Many Clouds, collapsed and died after narrowly beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. There is no mention in the article of the horse being \"hit by a horse.\" The horse's death is attributed to a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that the horse died from being hit by another horse, whereas the article provides a different cause of death, a severe pulmonary haemorrhage, which is unrelated to being hit by another horse.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that Many Clouds, the horse that died, collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.\n2. The summary states that a horse died after being hit by a horse in Cheltenham, but it does not mention the specific race or the fact that the horse collapsed after the race.\n3. The article explains that Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, which had seen him over-heat and \"wobble\" on his feet, but the horse had never collapsed before, and had shown no symptoms of post-race ataxia on Saturday.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about the horse's medical history or any previous conditions.\n5. The article quotes the British Horseracing Authority as saying that the horse suffered from a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage,\" which is a rare condition.\n6. The summary does not mention the specific cause of the horse's death.\n\nBased on the above points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not provide enough information and omits important details that are mentioned in the article, such as the fact that the horse collapsed after the race and had a history of post-race ataxia. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
