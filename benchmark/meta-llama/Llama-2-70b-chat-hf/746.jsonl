{"document": "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.", "claim": "espn 's britt mchenry is in the news after a video of her berating an employee of a tow company in arlington , virginia . peggy drexler : mchenry 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement .", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "2beb3c90dd9c2fe8288f352b6b973b5a0b5dd0dc", "model_name": "bert_sum", "annotations": [0, 1, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "GramE", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia.", "Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this.", "Makes my skin crawl even being here.\"", "And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\"", "It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend.", "McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility.", "It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\"", "ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week.", "Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light.", "But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story.", "The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on.", "McHenry knew she was being taped;

The summary mentions Peggy Drexler and her suggestion that McHenry's reaction may have been due to an overblown sense of entitlement.\n3.The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that Peggy Drexler made a direct comment about McHenry's sense of entitlement, while the article provides an analysis by Peggy Drexler without directly attributing the comment about entitlement to her. The summary simplifies the information and directly attributes the statement to Drexler, which is not explicitly stated in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article discusses a video that surfaced showing Britt McHenry, an ESPN reporter, berating an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia.\n2. The article mentions that McHenry issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration, but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility.\n3. The article also discusses how the video was heavily edited and only showed McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her.\n4. The article questions whether McHenry's reaction was a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, and suggests that the public's quick judgment of McHenry without fully knowing the other side of the story is problematic.\n5. The article concludes that the public's obsession with celebrity fall from grace and our dependence on social media can lead to dangerous vigilantism and a lack of objectivity.\n\nBased on the summary, it appears that the author's main point is that Britt McHenry's reaction in the video could have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, and that the public's quick judgment of her without fully knowing the other side of the story is problematic. The summary does not mention the other points discussed in the article, such as the heavily edited video and the public's obsession with celebrity fall from grace. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the entire article, but it does accurately reflect one of the main points discussed in the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the entire article, but it does accurately reflect one of the main points discussed in the article."}
