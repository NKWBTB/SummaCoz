The summary states that bristol rovers have signed striker jeremy clarkson on loan from brentford until the end of the season.\n2. However, the article only mentions that Clarkson played for Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.\n3.

The article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, which contradicts the summary's claim that Bristol Rovers signed him on loan from Brentford.\n2. The article does not mention anything about Clarkson being on loan from Brentford or any other club.\n3. The article does mention that Clarkson has played for Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers in the past, but it does not suggest that he is currently playing for any of those clubs.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about Clarkson's previous teams, which suggests that the author of the summary was not aware of his history.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article. The information in the summary is not supported by the article, and there are several inconsistencies between the two.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
