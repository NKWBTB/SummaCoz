The article states that the new law in Bolivia allows children as young as 12 to work with parental authorization.\n2. The article also mentions that the law sets harsher punishment for violence against children, including a 30-year sentence for child homicide.\n3. The article quotes Vice-President Alvaro Garcia Linera as saying that the law reflects the needs of Bolivia, a poor country, and that it aims to eradicate extreme poverty.\n4. The article mentions that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) recommends a minimum working age of 15, but allows a minimum age of 14 for developing countries.\n5. The article states that the ILO is studying the legislation to determine whether it breaches international regulations on child labour.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the law in Bolivia does not ban children from working altogether, but rather allows them to work with parental authorization at a younger age than what is recommended by the ILO. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it implies that children are banned from working altogether, which is not accurate.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
