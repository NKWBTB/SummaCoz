The summary states that a collection of valuable items has been put up for sale at a museum in Staffordshire.\n2. However, the article states that the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.\n3.

The article states that the collection includes 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters, and photographs.\n2. The summary does not mention the specific number of items in the collection, but it does state that they are worth up to a certain amount (which is not specified).\n3. The article mentions that the collection was at risk of being sold and scattered around the globe if the fundraising campaign had not been successful.\n4. The summary does not mention the risk of the collection being sold and scattered, but it does state that the items are being put up for sale at a museum in Staffordshire.\n5. The article states that the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire, and will be loaned to the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n6. The summary does not mention the museum in Barlaston or the loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While it does mention the sale of the collection, it does not provide the same level of detail as the article, and it does not mention some of the key points, such as the risk of the collection being scattered and the ultimate decision to keep the collection on display at the museum in Barlaston.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
