The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat.\n2. However, the article does not mention that the man was specifically convicted of \"sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat.\" The article provides details about Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister. While the article describes sexual misconduct and harassment, it does not specify that it occurred in a Dundee flat or use the term \"sexually abusing.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary simplifies the charges and circumstances, which are more complex in the article, and uses different terminology that is not directly supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man in a Dundee flat. The summary mentions that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a woman in a Dundee flat, which aligns with the information in the article.\n2. The article states that Weatherhogg was convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner on Christmas Day. The summary does not mention this specific detail, but it does mention that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a woman, which suggests that the summary is referring to the same case.\n3. The article mentions that Weatherhogg was placed on the sex offenders register and that he had denied the charges but was found guilty following a trial. The summary does not mention these details, but it does mention that the man was jailed, which suggests that he was found guilty of the charges.\n4. The article quotes the judge as saying that Weatherhogg posed a moderate risk of sexual re-offending. The summary does not mention this detail, but it does mention that the man was jailed, which suggests that the judge considered the risk of re-offending when determining the sentence.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary provides a brief overview of the case, highlighting the main points, while the article provides more detailed information about the case. Therefore, I answer (yes) the question: Is the summary consistent with the article?"}
