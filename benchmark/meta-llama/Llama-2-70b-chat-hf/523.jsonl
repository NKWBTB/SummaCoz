The summary implies that the family of an 11-year-old boy from County Fermanagh has not been able to go to school because of a special education system.\n2.

It doesn't imply that the special education system itself is preventing the boy from going to school.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests that the special education system is the direct cause of the boy not being able to go to school, while the article specifies that it's the lack of available places in special schools that is the issue.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that the boy is from Northern Ireland, specifically County Fermanagh. The summary does not mention the county, but it does state \"an 11-year-old boy from county fermanagh\" so this is consistent.\n2. The article states that the boy's family does not want him to be named to protect his identity. The summary does not mention this, but it does not contradict it either.\n3. The article explains that the boy's parents removed him from mainstream schooling because he was not coping and they requested a place for him at a special school. The summary mentions that the boy has not been able to go to school because of a special education system, which is consistent with the article.\n4. The article mentions that the family was told that all the special schools in the South Eastern Education Board area were full to capacity and no time frame could be given as to when a place would become available. The summary does not mention this specific detail, but it does state that the family is waiting for a place at a special school, which is consistent with the article.\n5. The article quotes the boy's mother expressing her concerns about the special needs school system being packed to capacity and the impact on other families. The summary does not mention this, but it does state that the family is waiting for a place at a special school, which implies that there is a shortage of places.\n6. The article mentions that the Education Authority is reviewing the profile of need for special school places in Northern Ireland and is endeavoring to ensure that places are available close to where the children reside. The summary does not mention this, but it does not contradict it either.\n\nBased on the above, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.\n\nYes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
