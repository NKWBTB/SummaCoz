The summary implies that Southampton City Council has been told to pay hundreds of millions of pounds a day for applying for a license because of a lack of funding.\n2. However, the article does not contain any information about Southampton City Council being required to pay such a substantial daily amount for applying for a license or any mention of a lack of funding. The article discusses the costs and fines associated with House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licenses but does not include the information stated in the summary.\n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions that landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO), but it does not mention anything about Southampton City Council being told to pay hundreds of millions of pounds a day for applying for a licence.\n2. The article states that the licence can cost \u00a31,000, but there is no mention of a daily fee or a specific amount that the council needs to pay.\n3. The article mentions that the council has gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals, but it does not mention any financial penalties or fees associated with these prosecutions.\n4. The summary implies that the lack of funding is the reason for the council's struggle to enforce licensing regulations, but the article does not mention anything about funding or a lack thereof.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article focuses on the requirement for landlords to obtain a licence for HMOs and the council's efforts to enforce this regulation, while the summary mentions a lack of funding for the council's licensing regime.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
