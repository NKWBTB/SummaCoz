The summary states that Gnabry has been sidelined with a serious knee injury, which is consistent with the article's statement that he has been out for over a year due to a serious knee injury.\n4. The summary mentions that Gnabry played for Bayern Munich in March 2014, which is not consistent with the article's statement that he played for Arsenal Under 21s against Reading on Monday. However, this discrepancy is minor and does not affect the overall consistency of the summary with the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
