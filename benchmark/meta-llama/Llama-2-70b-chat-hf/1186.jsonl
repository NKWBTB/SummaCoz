The article mentions that Rhys Webb has not played since suffering a serious foot injury in a World Cup warm-up with Italy in September.\n2. The article also mentions that Webb is close to a return and is going through a pre-season sort of stage at the moment.\n3.

The article mentions that Webb has renewed his national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union.\n5. The summary states that Rhys Webb says he hopes to return to the Ospreys and play for Wales.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it seems that Webb is indeed planning to return to the Ospreys and play for Wales. The article mentions that he is close to a return from injury and has renewed his contract with the Ospreys and Welsh Rugby Union. Additionally, Webb's quote about wanting to put himself in the best possible position to play for his country suggests that he is hoping to return to the Wales team as well.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
