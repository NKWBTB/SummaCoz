The summary states that divorce lawyers are being warned and being let down by a new form of divorce form.\n2. However, the article does not suggest that the new form is a letdown or warning for divorce lawyers.\n3.

The article discusses the introduction of a new form for applying for a divorce in England and Wales, which includes a field for naming the person your spouse has committed adultery with.\n2. The article quotes family lawyers expressing concern that including this field will increase conflict and complexity in divorce proceedings.\n3. The article also mentions that the guidance on the form states that it is not normally necessary to name the person your spouse committed adultery with, but that many people are unlikely to read or ignore this guidance.\n4. The article goes on to explain that naming the person your spouse committed adultery with can make them a party to the court case, leading to delays and increased costs.\n5. The article concludes by stating that divorce lawyers are being warned that they are being let down by the new form.\n\nBased on this information, my answer to the question is:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that divorce lawyers are being let down by the new form, but the article does not explicitly state this. While the article does mention that family lawyers are concerned about the new form, it does not suggest that they are being let down by it. Additionally, the article provides context and explanations about the new form and its potential impact on divorce proceedings, which are not reflected in the summary."}
