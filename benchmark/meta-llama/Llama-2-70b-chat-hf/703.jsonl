Here's why:\n\n1. The article talks about landlords needing a license for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO) if they rent to more than three unrelated people. The summary does not mention anything about licenses or HMOs.\n2. The article mentions that many landlords are not applying for the license despite facing a fine of up to \u00c2\u00a320,000. The summary does not mention any fines or penalties for not having a license.\n3. The article states that there are 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area, but the summary does not mention this number.\n4. The article quotes a Shelter helpline adviser saying that tenants in HMOs often have concerns about eviction and living in poorly maintained properties. The summary does not mention any of these concerns.\n5. The article mentions that mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people. The summary does not mention any of these criteria.\n6. The article mentions that the council has gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals, but the summary does not mention any prosecutions.\n\nTherefore, the summary does not accurately represent the information in the article. The summary implies that there is a shortage of council tenants, which is not mentioned in the article. The article is focused on the issue of landlords not applying for licenses for HMOs, while the summary is focused on a different issue altogether.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
