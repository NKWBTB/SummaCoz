The article states that Martin crashed at this year's TT and the Fireblade bike has been plagued by mechanical problems.\n2. Martin later clarified his position on Facebook, stating that he has not given up on racing or road racing, but he has no plans to do any more road racing on the Hondas this year.\n3. The article mentions that Martin did not race at the North West 200 after team-mate John McGuinness crashed in practice, and he will not compete in next month's Ulster Grand Prix.\n4. Martin expressed his frustration with the TT, stating that it was a \"bloody disaster\" and that he was essentially a test rider for the team.\n5. Martin also mentioned that the bike won't be competitive at the Ulster Grand Prix, and the team decided to withdraw him from the event without telling him.\n6. Martin expressed his desire to race classics and oddball stuff in the future.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that Martin has not given up on racing altogether, but he has decided to step back from road racing on the Hondas for the time being. He has expressed frustration with the mechanical problems and the team's decision to withdraw him from the Ulster Grand Prix. Therefore, the summary, which states that Martin will not quit racing at the 2016 Isle of Man TT because of a mechanical problem, is not entirely accurate.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
