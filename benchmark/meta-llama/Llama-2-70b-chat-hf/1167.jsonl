The summary states that a British woman claimed \u00a370,000 from a phone scam in Stranraer, but the article does not mention any such amount. The article only mentions a woman in Stranraer losing money to a caller who claimed to be from BT technical support. \n2. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a specific amount of money that was claimed, while the article does not provide any information about the amount of money lost.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions a woman from Stranraer who lost money to a caller claiming to be from BT technical support, but it does not mention the amount of money lost.\n2. The article does mention that the caller gained remote access to the woman's computer to take the cash, but it does not specify the amount of cash taken.\n3. The summary, on the other hand, claims that a British woman has claimed \u00a370,000 of cash from a phone scam in Stranraer.\n4. There is no mention in the article of anyone claiming \u00a370,000 from a phone scam, nor is there any mention of a British woman being involved in the incident.\n\nBased on the above points, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not provide enough information to support the claim made in the summary, and there are several discrepancies between the two. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
