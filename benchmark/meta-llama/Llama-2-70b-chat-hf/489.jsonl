The article provides information about his appointment and background but does not confirm details about his contract term or the team's performance in the Scottish Premiership.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which includes details not supported by the article, specifically regarding the contract length and the team's future performance.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Paul Sheerin, former player-manager at Arbroath, has been appointed as the new manager of Aberdeen on a two-year contract. This information is consistent with the summary.\n2. The article states that Sheerin replaces Neil Cooper at Pittodrie, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n3. The article mentions that Arbroath were relegated to Scottish League Two after finishing bottom of League One in the 2013-14 season. This information is not mentioned in the summary, but it does not contradict it either.\n4. The article quotes Aberdeen chief executive Duncan Fraser saying that boss Derek McInnes chose Sheerin after a comprehensive process. This suggests that Sheerin was not the only candidate for the job, which is not mentioned in the summary. However, this does not contradict the summary's statement that Sheerin was appointed as the new manager.\n5. The article mentions that Sheerin played for several Scottish clubs and also featured for \u00d6stersunds in Sweden before moving into coaching. This information is not mentioned in the summary, but it does not contradict it either.\n6. The article mentions that Sheerin guided Arbroath to their first national trophy in their history by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011. This information is not mentioned in the summary, but it does support the statement that Sheerin has experience as a manager.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article. Yes, the summary accurately summarizes the information in the article."}
