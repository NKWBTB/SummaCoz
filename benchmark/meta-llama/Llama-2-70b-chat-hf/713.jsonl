The summary implies that Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister, He Szijjarto, called on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws.\n2. However, the article does not mention He Szijjarto making such a statement or calling on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws. The article discusses Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and its objections to specific EU objections, such as tight controls on asylum seekers, regulations on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and a higher education law.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, introducing a statement by He Szijjarto that is unrelated to the article's content.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that the EU should not interfere with \"domestic issues\" and that Hungary would not backtrack on the three controversial laws.\n2. The summary states that Szijjarto called on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws. This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention anything about Szijjarto calling on the European Commission to block EU laws.\n3. The article does mention that Szijjarto said that Hungary would veto any EU sanctions against it, and that Poland had also agreed to veto any such sanctions.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about Poland's agreement to veto EU sanctions, which is a significant aspect of the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
