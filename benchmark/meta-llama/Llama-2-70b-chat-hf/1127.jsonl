The article mentions that agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover agency fees and employers' costs, such as National Insurance contributions.\n5. The article states that NHS Improvement will start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.\n6. The article mentions examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors, which suggests that some hospitals are still overspending on agency staff.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it seems that NHS Improvement is taking steps to address the issue of overspending on agency staff in NHS hospitals in England. However, the summary's statement that NHS hospitals are facing a major overhaul of their spending plans is not directly supported by the information in the article. The article focuses specifically on the issue of agency staff spending and does not mention any broader overhaul of hospital spending plans.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
