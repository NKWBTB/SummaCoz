The article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, which contradicts the summary's statement that Bristol Rovers signed him on loan from Brentford.\n2. The article does not mention anything about Clarkson being on loan from Brentford or any other club.\n3. The article does mention that Clarkson has played for Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers in the past, but it does not suggest that he is currently playing for any of those clubs.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about Clarkson's previous teams, which suggests that the author of the summary was not aware of his full history.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides information about Clarkson's current situation and past experiences, but it does not support the claim that he has been signed by Bristol Rovers on loan from Brentford.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
