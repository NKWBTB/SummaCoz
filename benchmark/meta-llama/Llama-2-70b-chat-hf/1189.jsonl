Nowhere in the article does it mention anything about copyrighted images.\n\nBased on the above, my answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that all images are copyrighted, but the article does not mention anything about copyrighted images. Therefore, the summary is not supported by the information in the article."}
