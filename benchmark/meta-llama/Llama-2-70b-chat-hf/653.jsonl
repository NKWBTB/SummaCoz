The summary states that a horse has died after falling from a balcony at Cheltenham's festival, and this revelation is linked to the death of an 11-year-old boy.\n2.

The article states that Many Clouds, a 10-year-old Irish-bred horse, collapsed and died after winning a race at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.\n2. The summary states that a horse has died after falling from a balcony at Cheltenham's festival, with no mention of a race or any other details.\n3. The article mentions that Many Clouds had previously shown symptoms of post-race ataxia, which had seen him over-heat and \"wobble\" on his feet, but had never collapsed before.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about post-race ataxia or any other health issues the horse may have had.\n5. The article quotes the British Horseracing Authority as saying that the horse suffered from a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage,\" which is a rare condition.\n6. The summary does not mention anything about a pulmonary haemorrhage or any other specific cause of death.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide any details that are supported by the article, and in fact, contains information that is not present in the article (such as the horse falling from a balcony). Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
