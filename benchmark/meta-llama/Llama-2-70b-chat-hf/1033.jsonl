The summary mentions that Peter Wright, a celebrity reality TV star, is set to take over Billericay Town.\n3. The article does not mention anything about Wright taking over the club, only that he is set to become a club director.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about Wright buying 20% of the club, only that he is set to take over.\n\nBased on the above, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides specific information about Wright's role at Billericay Town, while the summary misrepresents that information and implies that Wright is taking over the club. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
