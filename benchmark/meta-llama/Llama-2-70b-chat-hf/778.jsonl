{"document": "Mila Kunis is being sued by a Ukrainian wannabe singer who claims the Hollywood actress 'stole her pet chicken' as children. Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that\u00a025 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo \u00a0claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.
