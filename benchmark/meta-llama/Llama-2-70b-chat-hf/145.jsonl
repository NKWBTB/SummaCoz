A mother has said she is 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead at their home in Dundee. Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of\u00a0Sophia Walker after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of\u00a0Saturday. Her mother Patricia Hodgdon, 34, wrote a series of messages on Facebook saying: 'Me and Chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak. 'I want her back. Please please. Why why please say I'm dreaming plz.' Ambulance crews rushed to the home in Dundee\u00a0after receiving reports of the  sudden death, but they were unable to revive the baby. It is understood that Sophia\u00a0was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father, Charles Walker, at the home in Kirkton. Both the parents were being comforted by friends and relatives today and\u00a0flowers were laid at the gate of the house. Police Scotland confirmed an investigation has been launched into the death and that it is being treated as unexplained. A spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained. Inquiries are at an early stage and as is standard practice a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.' Neighbour Dexylee Mullady, 19, said she was shocked and saddened that the baby had died. She said: 'I have only ever seen pictures of her on Facebook and never seen her outside. She looked like she was a tiny little thing - I can't believe this has happened. 'This is really horrible - we can't imagine what the family must be going through.' She said police had been outside the home in Dundee all weekend. A police van  was outside the home in Dundee all weekend and friends left flowers and tributes at the gate .", "claim": "police have launched probe into 'unexplained death' of sophia walker. police have launched a probe into the 'tragic death' of sophia walker. mother said she is 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead. her mother wrote a series of messages saying: 'me and chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak' sophia was born premature in late december and lived with mother and father.", "cnndm_id": "6b98c92e0fe58e6ff1624ffed99889f49b1eae76", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of Sophia Walker (pictured) after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of Saturday .", "A mother has said she is 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead at their home in Dundee.", "Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of\u00a0Sophia Walker after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of\u00a0Saturday.", "Her mother Patricia Hodgdon, 34, wrote a series of messages on Facebook saying: 'Me and Chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak.", "'I want her back.", "Please please.", "Why why please say I'm dreaming plz.'", "Ambulance crews rushed to the home in Dundee\u00a0after receiving reports of the  sudden death, but they were unable to revive the baby.", "It is understood that Sophia\u00a0was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father, Charles Walker, at the home in Kirkton.", "Both the parents were being comforted by friends and relatives today and\u00a0flowers were laid at the gate of the house.", "Police Scotland confirmed an investigation has been launched into the death and that it is being treated as unexplained.", "A spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained.", "Inquiries are at an early stage and as is standard practice a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.'", "Neighbour Dexylee Mullady, 19, said she was shocked and saddened that the baby had died.", "She said: 'I have only ever seen pictures of her on Facebook and never seen her outside.", "She looked like she was a tiny little thing - I can't believe this has happened.", "'This is really horrible - we can't imagine what the family must be going through.'", "She said police had been outside the home in Dundee all weekend.", "A police van  was outside the home in Dundee all weekend and friends left flowers and tributes at the gate ."], "sum_sents": ["police have launched probe into 'unexplained death' of sophia walker.", "police have launched a probe into the 'tragic death' of sophia walker.", "mother said she is 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead.", "her mother wrote a series of messages saying: 'me and chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak'", "sophia was born premature in late december and lived with mother and father."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 3, 8], "cot": "1.

However, the article states that police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of Sophia Walker. The summary is consistent with this part. The summary also mentions that Sophia's mother wrote a series of messages saying, 'me and Chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak.' This is consistent with the information in the article. However, the summary introduces an inconsistency by stating that the police have launched a probe into the 'tragic death' of Sophia Walker. The article consistently refers to the death as 'unexplained' and not explicitly as 'tragic.'\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary introduces new information by stating that the police have launched a probe into the 'tragic death' of Sophia Walker, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that police have launched a probe into the \"unexplained death\" of Sophia Walker, and the summary also mentions this.\n2. The article quotes the mother, Patricia Hodgdon, as saying that she and her partner, Chaz, are \"heartbroken\" after their three-month-old daughter was found dead. The summary also mentions this.\n3. The article states that Sophia was born prematurely in late December and lived with her mother and father. The summary also mentions this.\n4. The article mentions that police were outside the home in Dundee all weekend, and the summary does not contradict this.\n5. The article quotes a neighbor, Dexylee Mullady, as saying that she was shocked and saddened by the baby's death. The summary does not mention this, but it does not contradict it either.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, and it does not contain any information that is not supported by the article.
