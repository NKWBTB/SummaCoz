The summary states that the defendant was found guilty of stabbing the victim to death, but the article does not mention any physical violence or weapons.

The article mentions that the defendant, Davina, was found guilty of rape, not manslaughter.\n2. The summary mentions that the victim was stabbed to death, while the article states that the victim was raped.\n3. The summary mentions that the crime took place in Winchester, while the article states that it took place in Portsmouth.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about the defendant's learning difficulties or the protocols put in place for her detention, which are mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains incorrect information and omits important details, which suggests that it is not a reliable summary of the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
