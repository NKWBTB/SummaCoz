Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade.

The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary mentions  eu will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country, but the fact in article is Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK, the Mail can reveal. \n2.

The article states that migrants from outside the EU will be required to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK. The summary does not mention this requirement specifically, but it does state that migrants will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country.\n2. The article explains that the measure is aimed at preventing serious and violent criminals from entering the UK. The summary mentions that ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals, which is consistent with the article.\n3. The article states that the scheme will begin to be rolled-out in the summer. The summary does not mention a specific timeline for the implementation of the measure.\n4. The article notes that some groups, such as visitors, asylum seekers, and those under the age of 18, will be exempt from the requirement. The summary does not mention these exemptions.\n5. The article emphasizes that the measure is aimed at migrants who come to Britain to live or work. The summary, on the other hand, states that migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have committed a crime. This is not consistent with the article, as the requirement is for migrants to provide a criminal records certificate, not to prove that they have committed a crime.\n\nBased on these points, I would answer (no) the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary contains some inaccuracies and omissions, and it does not fully convey the details and intent of the measure described in the article."}
