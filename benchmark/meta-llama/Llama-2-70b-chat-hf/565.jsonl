The summary states that eastenders actress barbara kemp has returned to eastenders to return to eastenders for a second time.\n2. However, the article provides accurate information that Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell, is returning to EastEnders for Barbara Windsor's character Peggy Mitchell's final episodes. There is no mention of Barbara Kemp in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary's incorrect attribution of actions to Barbara Kemp and the inaccurate representation of the character's return, while the article correctly presents the facts about Ross Kemp's return to the show and Peggy Mitchell's storyline.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell, is returning to EastEnders for Barbara's final episodes.\n2. The summary mentions that Barbara Kemp has returned to EastEnders for a second time.\n3. The article states that Barbara's character, Peggy Mitchell, will be killed off in emotional scenes to be screened in the spring.\n4.

The article quotes Ross Kemp as saying that he is looking forward to filming \"classic EastEnders episodes.\"\n6. The summary does not mention anything about Ross Kemp's comments or his excitement about returning to the show.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary only mentions Barbara Kemp's return to EastEnders, without providing any additional information or context. It does not mention Peggy's death, the reunion of the Mitchell brothers, or Ross Kemp's comments about returning to the show. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
