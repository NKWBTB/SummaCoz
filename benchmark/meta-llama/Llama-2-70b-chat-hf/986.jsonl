Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary states that Patrick Kluivert has had a winning start in World Cup qualifiers, and the article confirms this by mentioning that Curacao, the team Kluivert coaches, has advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF.\n2. The summary mentions that the Caribbean island team advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF, which is consistent with the article's statement that Curacao advanced to the next stage of 2018 World Cup qualification.\n3. The summary states that Kluivert's team won 4-3 on aggregate at Montserrat, which is consistent with the article's statement that Curacao won 4-3 on aggregate against Montserrat in the first-round encounter.\n4. The summary mentions that the Holland face 2-2 in a second-leg match at Montserrat, which is not explicitly stated in the article. However, the article does mention that Curacao drew 2-2 in a second-leg match at Montserrat, which implies that the team Kluivert coaches faced a 2-2 draw in that match.\n5. The summary does not mention any other information that is not supported by the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
