The summary mentions Tesco selling its Fresh & Easy chain, which is consistent with the article.\n2. The summary mentions Yucaipa, a private equity company, buying the chain, which is also consistent with the article.\n3. The summary does not mention the number of employees transferring to the new business, but the article states that around 4,000 of the 5,000 employees will transfer, which is not inconsistent with the summary.\n4. The summary does not mention the loan from Tesco to the new business, but the article states that Tesco will loan the new business around \u00a380m, which is not inconsistent with the summary.\n5. The summary does not mention the remaining 50 stores being closed, but the article states that it is understood that these stores will be closed, which is not inconsistent with the summary.\n6. The summary does not mention the cost to Tesco of disposing of the Fresh & Easy brand, but the article states that it will cost Tesco \u00a3150m, which is not inconsistent with the summary.\n7. The summary does not mention Tesco having the option to buy a stake in the business if Yucaipa is successful, but the article states that this is the case, which is not inconsistent with the summary.\n\nBased on the above, I would say that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nYes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
