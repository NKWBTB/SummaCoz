The article states that the family was struggling to raise funds for Charlie's treatment, and they received an anonymous donation that covered the cost of the treatment.\n2. The summary states that the mother of a three-year-old boy with a rare form of brain cancer has paid for a \u00a32,000 donation from his mother.\n3. The article does not mention the mother paying for the donation, but rather an anonymous donor paying for the treatment.\n4. The summary does not match the information in the article, as the article states that the donation was anonymous, while the summary states that the mother paid for the donation.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
