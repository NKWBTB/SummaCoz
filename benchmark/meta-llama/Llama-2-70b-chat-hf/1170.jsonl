Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Jamie Mitchell, the defendant, had admitted to intervening in an argument between his mother and Ken Dickie, the deceased.\n2. The article also mentions that Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight outside the holiday park bar.\n3. The summary states that a man (Mitchell) has been found guilty of assaulting his mother (Samantha Mitchell).\n4. The article mentions that Samantha Mitchell and Mr. Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a \"down phase\" when the incident occurred.\n5. The article also mentions that Mitchell and his mother had initially lied to the police about the course of events, saying that Mr. Dickie had pushed Mrs. Mitchell and she had pushed him back.\n6. The summary does not mention the death of Mr. Dickie, but the article does state that he died in hospital six days after the incident.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary mentions the assault of the mother, which is supported by the article, and does not contradict any other information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
