The summary does not provide any information about the location of the incident.\n4.

The article states that the man fell from a cherry picker at about 13:45 GMT on Thursday, while the summary states that the man fell from a first-floor window on the Isle of Wight. These two statements are not consistent, as the article does not mention a first-floor window, and the summary does not mention a cherry picker.\n2. The article mentions that Lincolnshire Police are carrying out a joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive, while the summary does not mention anything about an investigation.\n3. The article states that the company is cooperating fully with the investigation, while the summary does not mention anything about the company's cooperation.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
