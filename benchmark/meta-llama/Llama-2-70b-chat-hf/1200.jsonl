The article mentions that Mr. Knight was being treated at Cygnet Hospital because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.\n4. The article also mentions that the Department of Health has admitted that patients are receiving care far from home and has committed to eliminating the inappropriate use of out-of-area treatments for adults in acute care by 2020/21.\n5. The summary, on the other hand, simply states that an inquest into the death of a man at a Somerset hospital found that a number of mental health patients died.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about a number of mental health patients dying, nor does it suggest that the inquest found that there were multiple deaths. Instead, the article focuses on the death of David Knight and the factors that contributed to his death. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
