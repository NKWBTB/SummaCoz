Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions Luke, an 18-year-old who is one of 14 successful candidates in the Fighting Chance scheme, while the summary talks about a 16-year-old boy becoming the first teenager to play taekwondo. The age discrepancy is a red flag.\n2. The article quotes GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall as saying that Luke has \"a lot of the basic ingredients\" but lacks the tactical game finesse of his sister Jade. The summary, on the other hand, implies that the teenager in question has become the first teenager to play taekwondo, which is not supported by the article.\n3. The article mentions the 14 successful candidates undergoing a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June, but the summary does not mention this.\n4. The article does not mention anything about the British Taekwondo Federation's chief executive, whereas the summary attributes the statement about the teenager becoming the first teenager to play taekwondo to the federation's chief executive.\n\nTherefore, based on the inconsistencies mentioned above, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
