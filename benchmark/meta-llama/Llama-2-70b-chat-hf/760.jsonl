The summary does not mention Rickie Fowler's response to the troll.\n7. The article states that Alexis also stood up for herself, posting that she works hard to support herself.\n8. The summary does not mention Alexis' response to the troll.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is missing some key details that are present in the article. Specifically, the summary does not mention the accusation of gold digging, Rickie Fowler's response to the troll, or Alexis' response to the troll. Therefore, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
