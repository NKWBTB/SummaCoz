The article does not mention anything about either Myles or Ruairi Keating joining Torquay United on loan until January.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that Myles Keating has left Barrow to join another club, and Ruairi Keating is joining Torquay United, but the duration of his stay is not specified.
