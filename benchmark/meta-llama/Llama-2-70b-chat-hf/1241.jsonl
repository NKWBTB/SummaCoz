The article only mentions \"Duncan Street\".\n2. The summary mentions \"a disused waste site\". However, the article does not mention a disused waste site.

The article mentions that the fire occurred on 2 March in Duncan Street, whereas the summary mentions that the fire occurred in Eamonn, County Down. This discrepancy suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n2. The article states that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire, whereas the summary mentions that the EA is to investigate the fire. This difference in information suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n3. The article provides details about the site operators, Asset and Land Group, and their compliance with fire safety legislation, whereas the summary does not mention this information.\n4. The article mentions that the cause of the fire remains undetermined, whereas the summary does not provide any information about the cause of the fire.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
