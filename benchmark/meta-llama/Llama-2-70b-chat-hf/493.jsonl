The summary implies that Danny Nesbitt has resigned as Ulster Unionist Party leader.\n2. However, the article states that Mike Nesbitt is the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, and there is no information about Danny Nesbitt resigning.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly mentions Danny Nesbitt instead of Mike Nesbitt.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions Mike Nesbitt's comments about transferring votes to the SDLP, which has caused controversy within the Ulster Unionist Party.\n2. The summary does not mention anything about Mike Nesbitt's comments or the controversy surrounding them.\n3. The summary only mentions Danny Kennedy's resignation as a party leader, which is not the main focus of the article.\n4. The article emphasizes the Ulster Unionist Party's manifesto and its calls for action in various areas, such as tackling waiting lists and standing up for the LGBT community.\n5.
