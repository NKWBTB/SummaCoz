The article mentions that the Lib Dems and Labour had been working together to inflict defeats on the government regarding the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.\n2. However, the article also states that the Lib Dems were determined to insist on their amendments, while Labour was prepared to defer to the Commons.\n3. The article quotes a Labour source in the Lords who accuses the Lib Dems of \"grandstanding\" and building up \"false hope\" with their amendments.\n4. The article also quotes Baroness Ludford, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson, who accuses Labour of \"waving through the government's plans\" and \"lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit\".\n5. Despite the tensions between the two parties, Baroness Ludford expresses optimism about the possibility of future collaboration, saying that the Lib Dems will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for issues they agree on.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the Lib Dems and Labour have had a history of collaboration in the past, but their efforts to work together on Brexit have been unsuccessful due to disagreements over the approach to the issue. The summary, which states that the Lib Dems have rejected calls by the Liberal Democrats to set up a Brexit deal with the EU, is not entirely accurate, as it implies that the Lib Dems have rejected calls from within their own party, which is not supported by the information in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
