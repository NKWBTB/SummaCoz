Here's why:\n\n1. The article states that the university said the move at Singleton Park was \"precautionary\", while the summary suggests that there was a \"suspicious\" explosion at a Cardiff University campus. The word \"suspicious\" implies that there was something sinister or dangerous about the explosion, which is not supported by the article.\n2. The article mentions that South Wales Police received a call about concerns regarding the safe storage of chemicals before a controlled explosion took place, but there is no mention of a student being taken to hospital.\n3. The article states that nobody was injured during the incident, which contradicts the summary's claim that a student was taken to hospital.\n4. The article clarifies that the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public, whereas the summary implies that the explosion was suspicious and potentially dangerous.\n\nTherefore, based on the inconsistencies between the summary and the article, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
