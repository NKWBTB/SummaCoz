The summary states that Christopher Hogwood has died at the age of 88, while the article states that he died at the age of 72. This discrepancy raises a red flag and suggests that the summary may not be consistent with the article.\n2. The article provides a detailed account of Hogwood's career and achievements, including his work with the Academy of Ancient Music, his recordings, and his roles as a music director and professor. The summary, on the other hand, only mentions his death and provides no additional information.\n3. The article quotes several individuals who knew Hogwood, including Christopher Purvis, Richard Egarr, Dame Emma Kirkby, and David Thomas. The summary does not include any quotes or statements from these individuals.\n4. The article provides a detailed description of Hogwood's contributions to the early-music movement and his legacy. The summary does not mention any of these details.\n\nBased on these observations, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide any additional information or context beyond what is stated in the article, and it contains an error regarding Hogwood's age at the time of his death.
