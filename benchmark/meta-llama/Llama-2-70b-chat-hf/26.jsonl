Beleaguered travellers have been warned that \u2018Easter is cancelled\u2019 as far as trains are concerned and many key services will be axed. On others they face hours of delays, with some journey times quadrupled. Worst affected will be the West Coast main line, where Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel. Scroll down for video . Passengers face travel chaos this Easter as Britain's busiest rail routes are expected to launch major engineering projects (file picture) The West Coast mainline, the Great Western and the Greater Anglia line are all planning works on key routes meaning passengers will face hours on rail replacement services or slower routes . The line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will have a four-day shutdown. On Easter Sunday a 55-minute direct trip from Rugby to London Euston will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes, with two trains and two buses. A Virgin Trains spokesman said: \u2018Easter is effectively cancelled \u2013 our line is shut. We\u2019re advising people not to travel. \u2018What makes it worse this time is that the alternative routes that passengers might normally switch to are also shut because of the engineering. This is unusual.\u2019 Failures: Poor planning, equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the Christmas train chaos, including a crush at Finsbury Park (pictured), a  report has found . Other services blighted by engineering works include London Midland, which uses the same West Coast line and has issued a similar warning, and swathes of the Great Western and Greater Anglia lines. Virgin services to Manchester and the North West and Birmingham are also badly affected with diversions adding heavily to journeys. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised for disruption from the \u00a3100million works by 14,000 engineering workers, but insisted it was vital. However, the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at Christmas when the key East Coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works, prompting a major inquiry, damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs, and a grovelling apology from rail bosses. Cancellations: The report found that\u00a0when work near King's Cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at Finsbury Park station but 'not enough was done' to manage passenger flow at the new station . Under a large headline on its website, Virgin Trains warns passengers of the impending Easter chaos with the words: \u2018There\u2019s a spanner in the works. Don\u2019t get caught in planned improvement works.\u2019 It said there would not be any trains to or from London Euston, adding: \u2018There won\u2019t be any replacement shuttles either, so finding an alternative train service to London will be very difficult.\u2019 Engineering works on the line between Crewe and Warrington and from Carlisle to Glasgow will \u2018severely reduce services to the North and Scotland\u2019, it said. Services are also likely to be \u2018extra busy the day before and after affected days\u2019 and passengers should book early. West Coast passengers also face major works at Watford Junction from an \u00a381million programme from Network Rail \u2018to improve the ageing infrastructure\u2019. Rail bosses say carrying out works during Christmas and Easter is justified as passenger numbers are down by up to 40 per cent because there are far fewer commuters. But ministers have suggested carrying out such works at times other than at Christmas and Easter \u2013 such as through the summer \u2013 to avoid hitting families travelling during the key holiday periods. Mr Carne said: \u2018We are acutely conscious that many people want to use the railway during the holidays to reunite with their friends and families, which is why the vast majority of the network is running normally over the holiday period, but there will be disruption for some.\u2019 He insisted that there were \u2018good contingency plans in place\u2019 while the improvements are carried out.",

The summary states that passengers face travel chaos this Easter due to engineering works on Britain's busiest rail routes.\n2. The article mentions that rail companies are warning passengers not to travel during Easter due to major route closures, which will cause delays and disruptions.\n3. The article specifically mentions the West Coast main line, Great Western, and Greater Anglia line, which are all planning major engineering projects during Easter.\n4. The article states that Virgin Trains has told passengers not to bother trying to travel during Easter, and that the line between London Euston and Milton Keynes will be shut down for four days.\n5. The article also mentions that other services, such as London Midland and services to Manchester and the North West, will also be affected by the engineering works.\n\nBased on the above points, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article. The article provides specific examples and details about the engineering works and their impact on rail services during Easter, which support the statement made in the summary.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
