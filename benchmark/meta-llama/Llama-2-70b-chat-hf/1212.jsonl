The article does not mention anything about plans to build a new generation of Royal Navy frigates on the Isle of Wight.\n\nTherefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions plans to build a new generation of Royal Navy frigates on the Isle of Wight, which is not mentioned in the article.
