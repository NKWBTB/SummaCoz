The summary states that Wayne Rooney will play in a match between Manchester United and Manchester United.\n2. The article mentions that Rooney's testimonial game will be streamed globally, but it does not mention anything about him playing in a match between Manchester United and Manchester United.\n3. The article does mention that the game at Old Trafford will be between Rooney's two professional clubs, but it does not specify that he will play in the match.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about the proceeds going to Rooney's chosen charities, which is a significant aspect of the article.\n\nBased on the above points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides misleading information and leaves out important details mentioned in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
