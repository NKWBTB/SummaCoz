The article mentions that Buttler has scored England's three fastest ODI centuries, but the summary does not mention this.\n3. The article quotes Ashley Giles, Lancashire's cricket director and head coach, praising Buttler's talent and the impact he had on the team's success in the T20 Blast final. The summary does not include these quotes.\n4.
