The article does not describe Simpson's work as \"extraordinary\" - that description is only used by the judge, Ansel Krut, in reference to the painting's subtlety and minimalism.\n4. The summary does not mention the size of the painting, the fact that it depicts a leper squint, or that it is part of a series of paintings.\n5.
