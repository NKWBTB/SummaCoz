The article states that the Wedgwood Museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire, was at risk of selling its collection to pay off a pension debt.\n2. The article also states that a public fundraising campaign was launched in September to save the collection, and that it hit its target in just a month.\n3. The article mentions that the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, and that the Art Fund will gift it to the Victoria and Albert Museum before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.\n4. The summary, on the other hand, states that an 18th century museum in London is to reopen as part of an art collection campaign to save it from being sold at auction.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about an 18th century museum in London, nor does it mention the museum being sold at auction. Instead, it focuses on the Wedgwood Museum in Barlaston and its collection being saved through a public fundraising campaign.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
