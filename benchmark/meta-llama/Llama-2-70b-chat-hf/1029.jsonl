The summary states that NRW has accused the UK government of having \"unrealistic\" plans for a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay.\n2. However, the article does not mention any accusations by NRW against the UK government.

The article mentions that NRW estimated the lagoon would mean 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, while TLP disputed these figures and claimed they had no clear scientific basis.\n2. The summary does not mention the specific percentage estimates, but it does state that NRW accused the UK government of having \"unrealistic\" plans for the tidal lagoon.\n3. The article also mentions that TLP claimed NRW refused to share its methodology for calculating the fish deaths, and that TLP's own computer modelling estimated a \"worst case scenario\" of 2% of all species of fish being killed.\n4. The summary does not mention TLP's alternative estimates or its criticism of NRW's methodology.\n5. The article notes that the Welsh Government is supportive of the scheme, but wants clarity on the UK government's position.\n6. The summary does not mention the Welsh Government's stance on the project.\n\nBased on the above, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article in its entirety. The summary focuses solely on NRW's accusation against the UK government, while the article provides a more comprehensive overview of the controversy surrounding the tidal lagoon project, including TLP's criticism of NRW's estimates and the Welsh Government's support for the scheme. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
