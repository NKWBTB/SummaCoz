The summary implies that a prison in Essex is \"frightened\" after reports of people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. While the article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the prison wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, it does not mention the prison itself being \"frightened\" or people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a statement not found in the article and misrepresents the prison's reaction to the reported incidents.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Chelmsford Prison has had \"numerous incidents\" of packages being thrown over the wall, and a former inmate claims that the prison is \"notorious\" for being \"flooded\" with contraband, including mobile phones and synthetic cannabis.\n2. The Ministry of Justice states that staff work \"extremely hard\" to prevent contraband from entering prisons, but acknowledges that more needs to be done.\n3. A woman who lives near the prison reports witnessing packages being thrown over the wall \"four times in two weeks\" and feels that the situation is \"getting quite bad.\"\n4. The former inmate claims that drones are used to fly contraband goods \"straight up to prison windows,\" but the Ministry of Justice denies any evidence of drones entering the Chelmsford site.\n5. The article mentions that laws have been introduced that could result in people who smuggle packages over prison walls being jailed for up to two years.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that there have been multiple incidents of contraband being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison, and that the prison and Ministry of Justice are taking steps to address the issue. However, there is no mention of the prison being \"frightened\" or of drones being used to throw packages over the wall. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
