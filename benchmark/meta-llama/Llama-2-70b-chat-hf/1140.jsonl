The report also includes information on Russian spending on the conflict, which is calculated at 53bn roubles (\u00c2\u00a3665m; $1bn).\n6.

The article also notes that while some Russians are aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, they nevertheless find it acceptable because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the summary is consistent with the article. The summary mentions that a report by Russia's human rights watchdog says a report into the deaths of more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine in 2014 has been published. This is supported by the article, which mentions that the report \"Putin. War\" includes information on the deaths of Russian soldiers in eastern Ukraine. Therefore, I answer (yes) the question in the end."}
