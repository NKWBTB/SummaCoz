The article states that \"four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.\" This suggests that children are more willing to try new foods at school than at home.\n2. The article also states that \"half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.\" This suggests that children are influenced by the foods they eat at school and want to try them again at home.\n3. The article mentions the results of a survey of parents, which found that 628 out of 1,000 parents questioned had children who ate school lunches. This means that about 63% of the parents surveyed had children who ate school lunches.\n4. The article does not mention anything about parents eating vegetables at home.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article focuses on children trying new foods at school and requests from parents to cook those foods at home, but it does not mention anything about parents eating vegetables at home. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
