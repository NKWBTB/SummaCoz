The summary states that one of the world's biggest physicists has warned that artificial intelligence could be used in humans.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about AI being used in humans. Instead, it talks about the potential risks and benefits of AI, and how OpenAI aims to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity.\n3. The article quotes Stephen Hawking as saying that AI could potentially \"re-design itself at an ever increasing rate\", but this is not the same as saying that AI will be used in humans.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions Stephen Hawking's warning that AI could potentially \"re-design itself at an ever increasing rate\", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution.\n2. However, the article also notes that other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote.\n3. The summary, on the other hand, states that one of the world's biggest physicists has warned that AI could be used in humans, which implies a more direct and immediate threat.\n4. The summary does not mention any opposing views or the possibility that the risk of AI posing a threat to humans is remote.\n\nBased on the above, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary seems to exaggerate the threat posed by AI and does not accurately represent the nuanced viewpoints presented in the article."}
