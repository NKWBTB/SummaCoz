The summary implies that the Justice Secretary has said that contraband has been thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses the issues of contraband being thrown over the wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, but it does not attribute this statement to the Justice Secretary.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests that the Justice Secretary made a specific statement that is not present in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Chelmsford Prison has experienced \"numerous incidents\" of packages being thrown over the wall, which is consistent with the summary's statement that contraband has been thrown over the wall.\n2. The article quotes a former inmate who claims that the prison is \"notorious\" for being \"flooded\" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis, which suggests that contraband is indeed being smuggled into the prison.\n3. The Ministry of Justice spokeswoman acknowledges that staff work \"extremely hard\" to stop contraband from getting into prisons, but also states that \"more must be done\" to address the problem, which implies that contraband is still managing to enter the prison.\n4. The article mentions a woman who lives near the prison who has witnessed packages being thrown over the wall \"four times in two weeks,\" which further supports the summary's claim that contraband is being thrown over the wall.\n5. The former inmate's claim that drones are being used to smuggle contraband into the prison is not supported by the Ministry of Justice, but this does not necessarily contradict the summary's statement about contraband being thrown over the wall.\n\nBased on these points, I would answer (yes) the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary accurately reflects the information presented in the article about contraband being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison."}
