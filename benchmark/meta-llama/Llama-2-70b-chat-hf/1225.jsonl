The article mentions that Craig Nelson/Preston was found dead at the Woodhead Tunnels in Derbyshire, and a post-mortem found that he died due to head injuries.\n2. The article also mentions that a 41-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were arrested in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police and remain in custody.\n3. The summary states that three people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man died following a head-on crash in South Yorkshire.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is consistent with the information provided. The article mentions two people being arrested in connection with the death of Craig Nelson/Preston, and the summary mentions three people being arrested on suspicion of murder. It's possible that the third person arrested is not directly related to the death of Craig Nelson/Preston, but the summary does not provide enough information to confirm this.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
