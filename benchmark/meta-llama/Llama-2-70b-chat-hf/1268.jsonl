These locations are not the same, which raises a red flag.\n2. The article mentions that several other people received minor injuries in the crash, but the summary does not mention any injuries. This omission could be significant, as it suggests that the summary is not providing a complete picture of the incident.\n3. The article states that the road was closed and diversions were put in place, but the summary does not mention any road closures or diversions. This lack of detail in the summary could indicate that it is not consistent with the article.\n4. The article mentions that Police Scotland said inquiries into the incident were ongoing, but the summary does not mention anything about the status of the investigation.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides limited information and omits important details, which suggests that it may not accurately represent the full story. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
