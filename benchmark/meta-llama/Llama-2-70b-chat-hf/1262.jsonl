The article mentions the upcoming semi-final match between Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori, but the summary does not mention this.\n5. The summary does not mention the other matches mentioned in the article, such as the ones involving Milos Raonic, Grigor Dimitrov, and Aljaz Bedene.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
