The article also mentions the club's previous efforts to avoid expulsion, including a payment deadline extension and a takeover bid by London businessman Tommy Agombar.\n4. The summary, on the other hand, simply states that the takeover of Kidderminster Harriers by Hereford United has been resolved.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the content of the article.
