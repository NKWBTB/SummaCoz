The summary implies that a maritime attraction has been canceled due to a lack of funds and is at the center of a public inquiry.\n2. However, the article does not mention the cancellation of a maritime attraction or a public inquiry related to it. The article discusses issues with a new chain ferry, breakdowns, grounding, and problems with the ferry's operation, but it doesn't mention the cancellation of a maritime attraction due to a lack of funds.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a completely unrelated topic of a maritime attraction being canceled, which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article discusses the problems surrounding the new vessel, including breakdowns, groundings, and damage to cars.\n2. The council leader, Dave Stewart, announces that the crossing at Cowes will be free until July 2nd to allow feedback and in recognition of the problems.\n3. The council orders a review of the project by auditors.\n4. Shopkeeper Angie Booth expresses concerns about the impact of the ferry's problems on local businesses.\n5. Transport councillor Ian Ward acknowledges that there have been teething problems but downplays the issues, saying that they are normal for a prototype.\n6. Ward also mentions that the council authorized the manufacture of ramp extensions to resolve the problem of vehicles scraping the concrete.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that a maritime attraction has been cancelled due to a lack of funds, but there is no mention of this in the article. The article focuses on the problems with the new vessel and the impact on local businesses, but it does not mention any cancellation of a maritime attraction. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
