The summary implies that thousands of unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton due to a shortage of landlords.\n2. However, the article does not support the idea that unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes. The article discusses the requirement for landlords to obtain licenses for Houses of Multiple Occupation (HMOs) and the challenges they face, such as the cost of licensing. It mentions concerns of tenants, but it doesn't state that landlords are being forced to live in their own properties.\n3.

The article mentions that landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO).\n2. The article states that many landlords are not applying for the licence despite facing a fine of up to \u00c2\u00a320,000, and the council estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area.\n3. The article quotes a Shelter helpline adviser saying that fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants.\n4. The article mentions that mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people.\n5. The article states that the council has gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals who have resisted applying for their licence.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that thousands of unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton because of a shortage of landlords, but the article does not mention anything about a shortage of landlords. Instead, it suggests that landlords are not applying for licences because of the cost (\u00c2\u00a31,000) and the fear of eviction and poorly maintained properties.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
