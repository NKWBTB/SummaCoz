The article mentions that the Fawley power station chimney is 198 meters high and dominates the Solent skyline, making it a notable landmark in the area.\n2. The summary states that the site of a former power station in the Solent is set to be turned into a former oil chimney site.\n3. The summary does not mention anything about the chimney being repurposed or transformed into a new attraction, but rather implies that the site will be turned into a former oil chimney site, which suggests that the chimney will be demolished.\n4.

Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article, as it suggests that the chimney will be demolished, while the article states that the developers plan to repurpose it.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
