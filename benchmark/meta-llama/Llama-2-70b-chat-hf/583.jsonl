However, the article discusses the Hebridean Celtic Festival (HebCelt) taking place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis from 19 to 22 July. There is no mention of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival in the article.\n3.

The article mentions the Hebridean Celtic Festival, while the summary mentions the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival. These are two different festival names, which suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n2. The article mentions the festival taking place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, while the summary does not mention a specific location for the festival.\n3. The article mentions specific acts performing at the festival, such as The Waterboys, Imelda May, and Lucy Spraggan, while the summary does not mention any specific acts.\n4. The article mentions the festival director, Caroline Maclennan, while the summary does not mention any specific person.\n5. The article mentions the festival's dates as July 19-22, while the summary does not mention any specific dates.\n\nBased on these differences, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately represent the information provided in the article, and it appears to be referring to a different festival altogether."}
