{"document": "Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The\u00a0bizarre\u00a0post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

The article provides additional information about Adebayor's history with Tottenham, including his initial loan signing and subsequent permanent transfer, as well as his declining goal return and the rise of Harry Kane, and the summary does not contradict any of this information.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
