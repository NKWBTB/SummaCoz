The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that three former royal navy frigates could be put up for sale. However, the article states that Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall were decommissioned. There are four frigates in the article instead of three former royal navy frigates.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions four decommissioned Type 22 frigates (HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham, and HMS Cornwall) that are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour.\n2. The article states that bidders had until January 23rd to register an interest in the ships, and that viewings are set to take place in late February and March.\n3. The article mentions that the government's Disposal Services Authority is handling the sale and wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.\n4. The article quotes Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, as saying that she is keen to see at least one of the ships saved from the scrapyard and that her preference is to turn one of them into a reef and diving attraction.\n5. The article states that the Ministry of Defence will \"consider all options\" for the frigates to ensure \"best financial return for the taxpayer\".\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the sale of the three frigates is still in the process of being finalized, and that no final decision has been made yet. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the frigates \"could be put up for sale in the future\" as the summary suggests.\n\nMy answer is therefore: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
