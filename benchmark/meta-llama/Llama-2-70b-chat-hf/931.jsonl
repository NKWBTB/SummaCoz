{"document": "Radamel Falcao's former Monaco team-mate Nabil Dirar\u00a0believes the Colombian must be regretting his failed loan move to Manchester United even though he was not happy in France. The former Atletico Madrid striker moved to Old Trafford on a season-long loan  last summer but has struggled to hit the heights he achieved before suffering a serious knee injury. United will have to pay \u00a346million to make Falcao's transfer permanent but having only scored four goals all season Louis van Gaal's side are unlikely to take up that option.

The article mentions that Falcao struggled during his loan move to Manchester United, scoring only four goals all season.\n2. The article also mentions that Dirar, Falcao's former teammate, believes Falcao would have been better off staying at Monaco, where he would have played and participated in the Champions League.\n3. The summary, however, states that Dirar believes Falcao would have been better off staying at Monaco because the Premier League is not the best for Falcao and he needs to work harder to be more consistent.\n4. The article does not mention anything about the Premier League not being the best for Falcao or him needing to work harder to be more consistent.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary adds new information not present in the article and misrepresents Dirar's statement. Dirar's statement in the article is limited to Falcao's well-being and participation in the Champions League, whereas the summary extends it to Falcao's performance and consistency in the Premier League."}
