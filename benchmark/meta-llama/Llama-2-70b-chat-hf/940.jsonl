The article mentions that Luis Enrique took charge of the club last summer, signing a two-year deal, and that he is only six games away from winning the title. This is also consistent with the summary, which states that Luis Enrique took charge of the club last summer, signing a two-year-deal, and that he is only six games away from winning the title.\n3. The article mentions that there has been speculation this season that Enrique will be replaced in the summer, but that Bartomeu has refuted these claims. This is not mentioned in the summary.\n4. The article mentions that Luis Suarez scored the opening goal for Barcelona against Valencia, and that Lionel Messi scored the second goal. This is consistent with the summary, which mentions that Luis Suarez scored the scoring for Barcelona after just one minute against Valencia.\n5. The summary mentions that Suarez has been replaced in the summer, which is not mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on the above, I would answer (yes) the question, as the summary is generally consistent with the corresponding article. However, point 5 above notes a minor discrepancy in the summary that is not present in the article."}
