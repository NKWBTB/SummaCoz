Google boss Eric Schmidt has confirmed that in fact the project is still going strong - and remains 'a big and very fundamental platform for Google'.

Google stopped selling the first version of Glass and shut its Explorer program in January, moving the project out of its Google X research lab into a standalone unit. Ivy Ross remained head of the Glass team but Tony Fadell, head of Google's Nest connected home division, now oversees strategy for the project. Cources claim Fadell wants to redesign the headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until 'it's perfect'. 'It is a big and very fundamental platform for Google,' Schmidt told the WSJ. 'We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project, which isn't true. 'Google is about taking risks and there's nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we're ending it.' He said Glass, like Google's self-driving car, is a long-term project. 'That's like saying the self-driving car is a disappointment because it's not driving me around now,' he said. 'These things take time.' Sources claim Glass' new boss Tony Fadell (pictured) wants to redesign the Google headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until it's complete.\u00a0One unnamed source told the New York Times that Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect' The firm brought in Tony Fadell from Nest - a home automation company Google bought in 2014 - to lead the team, replacing previous boss Ivy Ross. Ms Ross still works on the project and runs 'day-to-day' operations. In a statement in January, Mr Fadell said: 'Early Glass efforts have broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike. 'I'm excited to be working with Ivy to provide direction and support as she leads the team and we work together to integrate those learnings into future products.' An unnamed source added Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect.' The previous Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (\u00a3990), and was launched in the US in 2013, and the UK last summer. Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset (pictured) last month. It didn't abandon the project entirely, though, and promised to develop smart glasses under a different guise . Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave developers the chance to buy Glass (pictured) for $1,500 (\u00a3990), and launched in the US in 2013 . The firm had already been thought to be developing a new version, with chips made by Intel, to go on sale later this year. Aside from saying it was committed to working on the future of the product, Google gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product. 'It's hard to believe Glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop,' the Glass team said in a post on Google+ last month. 'We kept on it, and when it started to come together, we began the Glass Explorer Program as a kind of 'open beta' to hear what people had to say.' 'Glass was in its infancy, and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk. 'Well, we still have some work to do, but now we're ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run.' Google boss Sergey Brin (pictured) was spotted without the high-tech specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event last year. Since the headset was unveiled in 2013, the 41-year-old was rarely seen without them.

The summary implies that Google boss Eric Schmidt has confirmed that the Glass project is still going strong and remains a big and fundamental platform for Google. It also mentions the term 'Explorers' and suggests that the project is seen as one of Google's highest profile failures.\n2. However, the article states that Eric Schmidt confirmed the Glass project is still going strong under the control of Tony Fadell, and it remains a big and fundamental platform for Google. The term 'Explorers' is mentioned in the article, but it is associated with the users of the first set of several thousand Glass users, not as a failure. The article does not characterize the Glass project as one of Google's highest profile failures.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly associates the term 'Explorers' with the failure of the Glass project, whereas the article uses it to describe the users of the first set of Glass. Additionally, the summary inaccurately suggests that Eric Schmidt confirmed the project as one of Google's highest profile failures, which contradicts the article's information about the ongoing and fundamental nature of the Glass project.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.

The summary states that the project is still going strong. The article supports this by quoting Schmidt saying that Glass is still a long-term project and that Google is committed to working on the future of the product.\n4. The summary mentions that Google stopped selling the first version of Glass and shut down the Explorer program. The article supports this by stating that Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset and shut down the Explorer program.\n5. The summary does not mention anything about Tony Fadell, the new boss of the Glass team, wanting to redesign the headset from scratch or that the project is being developed under a different guise. The article does mention these points, but they are not included in the summary.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer (yes) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary accurately summarizes the main points from the article and does not include any information that is not supported by the article."}
