The summary implies that Hungary's President Michel Szijjarto warned that Hungary could refrain from making attempts to withdraw three laws for asylum seekers.\n2. However, the article does not mention Hungary's President Michel Szijjarto. Instead, it refers to Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Peter Szijjarto, expressing Hungary's reluctance to backtrack on the mentioned laws. The article discusses Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and its objections to specific EU objections, such as tight controls on asylum seekers, regulations on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and a higher education law.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, attributing statements to a non-existent \"President Michel Szijjarto\" and misattributing the statements to the wrong Hungarian official.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Hungary's President Michel Szijjarto said that Hungary would not backtrack on three laws regarding asylum seekers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and higher education.\n2. The summary states that Szijjarto warned that Hungary could refrain from making attempts to withdraw three laws for asylum seekers.\n3. The summary does not mention the other two laws (NGOs and higher education) that Szijjarto referred to in the article.\n4. The summary implies that Szijjarto's statement was a warning to the EU, whereas the article portrays it as a response to a question from Reuters.\n\nBased on the above, my answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary focuses only on one aspect of Szijjarto's statement (the potential refusal to withdraw laws related to asylum seekers) and omits the other two laws he mentioned, as well as the context in which he made the statement."}
