The article states that the player was under contract with Mansfield Town, but the club reached an agreement to bring him in on a free transfer. This means that the player was not signed for an undisclosed fee.\n2. The summary states that Mansfield Town have signed Marcus Bignot, which is not consistent with the article as Marcus Bignot is the manager of the club, not a player.\n3. The article mentions that the player spent the first half of the season on loan at Crawley, scoring three goals in 23 appearances. This information is not mentioned in the summary.\n4. The article states that the player will officially join on January 1st, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
