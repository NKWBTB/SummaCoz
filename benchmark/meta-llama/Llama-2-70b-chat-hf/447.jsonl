The summary states that a service of remembrance has been held in New Zealand to mark the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the answer to the question is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The article does not mention anything about a service of remembrance being held in New Zealand, nor does it mention the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. The article focuses on the Anzac Day commemorations held in London, including the dawn service, parade, and wreath-laying ceremony.
