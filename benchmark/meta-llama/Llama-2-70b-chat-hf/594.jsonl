The article mentions that Mr. Ratcliffe said he was trying to get a visa so he could visit his wife and daughter.\n\nBased on the information provided in the summary, it appears that the wife of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran has called on the government to appeal against her conviction. However, the article does not mention anything about the wife making this call herself. Instead, it is her husband who has criticized the UK government for a lack of action and spoken about the appeal happening in \"secret\". Therefore, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
