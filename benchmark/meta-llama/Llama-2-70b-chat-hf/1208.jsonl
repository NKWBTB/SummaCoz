The article states that Nicola Adams is fighting Alberto Salazar, not losing to him.\n2. The article mentions that Adams is fighting in her home city for the first time in 20 years, which suggests that she has not lost a fight recently.\n3. The article quotes Adams as saying that she needs more time to find her rhythm and establish her jab, which suggests that she is not concerned about losing in the first round.\n4. The article also mentions that Adams has learned new things in the gym that she wants to try out in the fight, which suggests that she is confident in her abilities.\n\nBased on these points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Adams lost her WBO super-bantamweight title to Salazar in the first round, but the article does not mention any loss for Adams. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
