The article discusses the situation in Greece and the Syriza government's agreement to implement austerity measures, despite previously rejecting them.\n2.

The article states that Alexis Tsipras remains popular despite failing to deliver an end to fiscal austerity.\n4. The article highlights the challenges faced by Greek companies in accessing credit, which could lead to a cancelled Christmas season for many retailers.\n5. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for creditors to ease Greece's debt burden by at least a third to a half for the new bailout deal to be successful.\n\nBased on the information in the summary, it appears that the author is suggesting that Alexis Tsipras and the Syriza government are under pressure from the rest of Europe to implement austerity measures, despite previously rejecting them. This is consistent with the information in the article, which mentions the impact of the economic crisis on Greece and the challenges faced by the government in implementing austerity measures.\n\nTherefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
