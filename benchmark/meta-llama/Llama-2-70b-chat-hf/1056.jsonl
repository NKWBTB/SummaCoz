The summary states that the White House says Jewish community centers have been threatened by hoax bomb threats.\n2. However, the article does not mention the source is from White House.

The article mentions that 27 Jewish community centers in 17 US states received hoax bomb threats last week, and 69 incidents have been reported in 27 states in the past month, according to the JCC Association of North America.\n2. The summary only mentions a number of Jewish community centers in the US being threatened by hoax bomb threats, without specifying the number or location of the incidents.\n3. The article provides additional information, such as the response from the White House, the FBI's investigation, and reactions from various organizations and individuals, including Ivanka Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n4. The summary does not include any of this additional information, focusing solely on the bomb threats and the White House's statement.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer (yes) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary accurately summarizes the main point of the article, which is the recent bomb threats to Jewish community centers in the US, and it does not include any information that is not supported by the article."}
