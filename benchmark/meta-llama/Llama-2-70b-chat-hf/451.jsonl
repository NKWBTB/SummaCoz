The summary implies that St Mirren have signed forward Jeremy Clarkson on loan from Dundee until the end of the season.\n2. However, the article states that the player in question is unnamed in the article, and there is no mention of Jeremy Clarkson. The article talks about a forward who joined Premiership Well for a second spell and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship. The player's name is not provided.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which mentions Jeremy Clarkson, a well-known television presenter, in connection with a football transfer, which is not supported by the article's content.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, which implies that he was previously at Dundee, as stated in the summary.\n2. The article also mentions that Clarkson has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term, which is consistent with the summary's statement that he was signed on loan from Dundee until the end of the season.\n3. The article quotes Clarkson as saying that he has been training hard and making sure that when his time came, he was ready and match fit, which is consistent with the summary's statement that he is looking forward to getting started.\n4. The article mentions that Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level, which is consistent with the summary's statement that he has experience playing for several clubs, including Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers.\n5. The article does not mention the specific length of Clarkson's loan deal, but it does state that he is set to make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday, which is consistent with the summary's statement that he was signed on loan until the end of the season.\n\nBased on the above points, I would answer (yes) the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, and all the information in the summary is supported by the article."}
