The summary mentions plans for a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront.\n2. However, the article discusses plans for a glass structure at the disused Fawley power station, which is not located on the edge of Southampton seafront but rather on the western side of Southampton Water.\n3.

The article discusses the proposal to convert the disused Fawley power station chimney into a tourist attraction, which would be the tallest such attraction south of London's Shard.\n2. The summary, on the other hand, mentions plans for a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront, without any mention of the power station or its chimney.\n3. The article provides details about the history and capabilities of the Fawley Power Station, as well as the developers' plans for the site, including a marina, housing, restaurants, and fast ferry links.\n4. The summary does not mention any of these details, instead focusing solely on the proposed glass tower.\n\nBased on these differences, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not provide an accurate representation of the information presented in the article, and omits several key points, including the focus on the power station chimney and the surrounding development plans."}
