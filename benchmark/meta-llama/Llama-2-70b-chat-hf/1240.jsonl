The article states that the victim was queuing for food at a branch in St George's Street, Canterbury when the assault occurred. The summary does not mention the location of the assault.\n2. The article states that three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people. The summary does not mention the number of attackers or their behavior before the assault.\n3. The article states that one of the group set light to the woman's hair. The summary does not mention the method of attack.\n4. The article states that officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack. The summary does not mention the release of CCTV images or the appeal for information.\n5. The article quotes Det Sgt Barry Carr as saying that the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could have turned out much worse. The summary does not mention the severity of the victim's injuries or the potential for worse harm.\n\nBased on these differences, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not provide an accurate representation of the information in the article, and leaves out several important details."}
