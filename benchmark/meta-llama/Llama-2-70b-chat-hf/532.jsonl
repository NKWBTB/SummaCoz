Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that the Wedgwood Museum was at risk of selling its collection to pay off a pension debt.\n2. The summary states that the collection of the Wedgwood Museum, which is the oldest collection in the UK, has been saved after a campaign to save it.\n3. The article explains that a public fundraising campaign was launched in September and hit its target in just a month, allowing the collection to remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.\n4. The summary does not mention the specific details of the campaign or the fact that the collection will be gifted to the Victoria and Albert Museum and then loaned back to the Wedgwood Museum. However, it does state that the campaign was successful in saving the collection.\n5. The article quotes Alison Wedgwood, a direct descendant of the company founder, who emphasizes the importance of the collection for Staffordshire and the risk of it being sold and scattered around the globe if the money had not been raised.\n6. The summary does not mention Alison Wedgwood's quote or the specific risk of the collection being sold and scattered. However, it does imply that the campaign's success ensured the collection's preservation.\n7. The article ends by mentioning Tristram Hunt MP's involvement in the campaign and his statement that the sale was \"fantastic news\" as the items in the collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining the national identity today.\n8. The summary does not mention Tristram Hunt MP's involvement or his statement. However, it does state that the campaign's success saved the collection, which aligns with Tristram Hunt's sentiment that the sale was \"fantastic news.\"\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary accurately states that the Wedgwood Museum's collection has been saved after a campaign, and it implies that the campaign's success ensured the collection's preservation. While the summary does not mention all the specific details from the article, it does not contain any contradictory information either. Therefore, the answer is yes"}
