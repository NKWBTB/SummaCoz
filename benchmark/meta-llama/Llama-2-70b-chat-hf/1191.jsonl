The summary, on the other hand, claims that the shooting happened in New York City.\n2. Number of shots fired: The article mentions that witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired. The summary, however, states that a gunman was fired at a police station, implying a single shot or a short burst of shots.\n3. Casualties: The article does not mention any fatalities, while the summary claims that at least 12 people were killed.\n4. Suspects: The article mentions that the suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off, but there is no mention of the number of suspects or their identity. The summary, however, implies that the shooting was carried out by a single gunman.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
