The article reports that Harbro Group, an Aberdeenshire-based company, saw a pre-tax profit increase of \u00a3800,000 to \u00a33.5m in the year ending June 2016.\n2. The article also mentions that the company's turnover fell by \u00a31m to just over \u00a3100m.\n3. The article notes that the company manufactures and supplies feeds for various animal sectors, including dairy.\n4. The article does not mention the Scottish dairy industry specifically, nor does it provide a pre-tax profit figure for the industry.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary reports a pre-tax profit figure of \u00a31.5m for the Scottish dairy industry, but the article does not provide such a figure. Additionally, the article focuses on the financial performance of Harbro Group, rather than the Scottish dairy industry as a whole.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
