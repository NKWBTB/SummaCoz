The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that the family of a 15-year-old boy from Northern Ireland is \"devastated\" by his response after going missing from school in Northern Ireland.\n2. However, the article does not mention that the boy went missing from school. It discusses the family's frustration with the lack of a place for their son in a special school due to his special needs.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly attributes the boy's disappearance from school and the family's devastation to the article, whereas the article is about the family's concerns regarding their son's education and the lack of special school placement.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that the boy's family does not want him to be named to protect his identity, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the family's devastation at the response.\n2. The article states that the boy's parents removed him from mainstream schooling because he was not coping, which is not mentioned in the summary. However, this fact does not contradict the summary's statement about the family's devastation.\n3. The article explains that the family requested a place for the boy at a special school but were told that all special schools in the area were full, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the family's struggles to find a suitable school placement.\n4. The article quotes the boy's mother expressing her concerns about the special needs school system being over-subscribed and her fears that other families may face similar struggles, which is consistent with the summary's statement about the family's devastation.\n5. The article mentions that the Education Authority is reviewing the profile of need for special school places in Northern Ireland, which is not mentioned in the summary. However, this fact does not contradict the summary's statement about the family's devastation.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.\n\nYes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
