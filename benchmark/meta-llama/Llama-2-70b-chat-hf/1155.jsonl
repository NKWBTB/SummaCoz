Here's why:\n\n1. The article is focused on the impact of climate change on global food security, particularly in relation to key transport routes such as the Panama Canal, Suez Canal, and Turkish Straits. The summary, on the other hand, mentions nothing about food security or transport routes.\n2. The article emphasizes the need for governments to invest in \"climate-resilient\" infrastructure and diversify food production and stocks. The summary does not mention anything about this.\n3. The article provides examples of how reliant the world is on trade, citing the risks for both importing and exporting countries. The summary does not mention anything about trade or the risks associated with it.\n4. The summary mentions the need for the UK to be \"warm and warm\" as a result of climate change, which is not mentioned in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article focuses on the impact of climate change on global food security and the need for climate-resilient infrastructure, while the summary mentions nothing about these topics and instead focuses on the UK's climate.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
