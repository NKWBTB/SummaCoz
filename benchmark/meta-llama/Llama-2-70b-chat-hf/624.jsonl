The summary states that parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children, as suggested by a survey.\n2. However, the article does not provide any information or data suggesting that parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children. The article primarily discusses children's experiences with school lunches, their willingness to try new foods, and the popularity of certain vegetables. It mentions parents giving packed lunches due to perceived fussiness but doesn't support the idea that parents are more likely to eat a meal than their children.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting information that is not supported by the article, creating a misrepresentation of the content.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. This suggests that school lunches can introduce children to new foods and encourage them to try new things.\n2. The article also states that half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. This suggests that children are enjoying the food they are eating at school and want to have it again.\n3. The article mentions that the survey found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn, and peas, and that aubergine, chickpeas, and spinach were among the least popular. This information is consistent with the idea that school lunches are introducing children to new foods, as some children may not have tried these vegetables before.\n4. The article notes that 628 out of 1,000 parents questioned had children who ate school lunches. This means that about 63% of the parents surveyed had children who ate school lunches, which is a significant proportion.\n5. The article quotes Rob Rees, the chairman of the School Food Trust, as saying that school meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and increase the variety of foods in their diet. This suggests that the School Food Trust believes that school lunches can have a positive impact on children's eating habits.\n\nBased on these points, I would answer the question as follows:\n\nYes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The article provides evidence to suggest that school lunches can introduce children to new foods and encourage them to try new things, and the summary accurately reflects this information."}
