The article states that Fosse Park is located near junction 21 of the M1, which is not in Cumbria. Cumbria is a county in northwest England, whereas Fosse Park is located in the Midlands.\n2. The summary mentions the owners of Fosse Park meeting in the city, but the article does not mention anything about a meeting taking place in the city.\n3. The summary mentions the new owners planning to improve the appearance of units, but the article only mentions plans to improve parking and traffic congestion and the quality of common areas.\n4. The quote from Ernie White in the article mentions Fosse Park being the gateway from Blaby into the city, but the summary does not mention anything about Blaby or the city.\n5. The quote from Paul Clarke in the article mentions Crown Estates being concerned about addressing parking and congestion issues and improving the quality of common areas, but the summary does not mention anything about these specific concerns.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The information in the summary is not fully supported by the information in the article, and there are some inaccuracies and omissions.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
