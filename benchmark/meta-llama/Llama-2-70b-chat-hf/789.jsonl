{"document": "(CNN)They may not be \"Star Trek\"-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. \"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,\" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. \"We know where to look. We know how to look,\" she said. \"In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road.\" NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. \"Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,\" the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. \"We are not talking about little green men,\" Stofan said at the panel. \"We are talking about little microbes.\" Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. \"I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,\" he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? \"Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,\" he said. \"And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.\"", "claim": "nasa scientist : `` we 're going to have strong indications of life beyond earth within a decade '' `` we know where to look . we know how to look , '' she says . nasa is n't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the alpha quadrant . it 's referring to microorganisms .", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "23a0f5d45517620ea12e8af780b2fa1cd9a2373a", "model_name": "bart", "annotations": [0, 0, 1], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "GramE", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)They may not be \"Star Trek\"-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says.", "\"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,\" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe.", "\"We know where to look.", "We know how to look,\" she said.", "\"In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it.", "And so I think we're definitely on the road.\"", "NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa.", "The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release.", "\"Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,\" the agency noted.", "There are some caveats involved, of course.", "NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms.", "\"We are not talking about little green men,\" Stofan said at the panel.", "\"We are talking about little microbes.\"", "Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well.", "\"I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,\" he said.", "And, he added, who knows what that life will look like?", "\"Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,\" he said.", "\"And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.\""], "sum_sents": ["nasa scientist : `` we 're going to have strong indications of life beyond earth within a decade ''", "`", "`", "we know where to look .", "we know how to look , '' she says .", "nasa is n't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the alpha quadrant .", "it 's referring to microorganisms ."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 10], "cot": "1.

The summary quotes NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan as saying that we will have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade and definitive evidence within 20-30 years. The article supports this by mentioning Stofan's statement during a panel discussion on water in the universe.\n2. The summary mentions that NASA has found evidence or indications of water on various celestial bodies, including Ceres and Europa. The article supports this by citing NASA's release of a graphic showing these findings and mentioning the role of the Hubble Space Telescope in providing evidence of a saltwater ocean on Ganymede.\n3. The summary notes that NASA is not looking for intelligent alien civilizations but rather microorganisms. The article supports this by quoting Stofan as saying, \"We are not talking about little green men, we are talking about little microbes.\"\n4. The summary mentions former astronaut John Grunsfeld's statement that we are one generation away from finding life outside our solar system, whether on an icy moon, Mars, or a planet around a nearby star. The article supports this by quoting Grunsfeld's statement during the panel discussion.\n5. The summary does not mention any caveats or limitations of the search for extraterrestrial life, which the article discusses.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.\n\nYes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
