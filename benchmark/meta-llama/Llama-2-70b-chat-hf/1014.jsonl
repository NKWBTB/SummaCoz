The article reports that the poverty rate in the US was 15% in 2011, which means that 46.2 million Americans were in poverty. This does not suggest that the US population has fallen to its lowest level since records began.\n2. The article mentions that real median income of households in the country dropped by 1.5%, but this does not necessarily indicate a decline in the overall population.\n3. The article provides information on the average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011, but this does not relate to the population size.\n4. The article notes that income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011, but this does not suggest a decline in the population.\n5. The article states that the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance fell to 15.7% from 16.3%, which is a positive trend, but it does not indicate a decline in the population.\n6. The article mentions that poverty in the US reached a record high in 2010, at 15.1%, but this does not suggest that the population has fallen to its lowest level since records began.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is not consistent with the summary statement that the US population has fallen to its lowest level since records began.\n\nAnswer: No."}
