The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that the mother of a 16-year-old boy who asked the education authority to protect him from mainstream schooling is being asked to look at the education authority.\n2. However, the article states that the boy's family requested a place for him at a special school because he was struggling with mainstream schooling. They are concerned about the lack of special school placements, but the summary's statement about the mother being asked to look at the education authority is not supported by the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which misrepresents the content of the article. The mother's concerns are about the lack of special school placements for her son, not her being asked to look at the education authority.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that the boy's parents requested a place for him at a special school, but the family is still waiting.\n2. The article also mentions that the boy's mother is worried that the same situation will happen to other families as the special needs school system is packed to capacity.\n3. The summary, however, implies that the mother is being asked to look at the education authority, which is not mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on the above points, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, specifically the idea that the mother is being asked to look at the education authority."}
