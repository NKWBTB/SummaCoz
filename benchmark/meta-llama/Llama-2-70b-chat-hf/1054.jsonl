The summary states that hundreds of students in South Korea have had to wait until Monday to take part in the university entrance test.\n3. The article mentions that ACT Inc, the organization that operates the test, said it took the decision to cancel the test after receiving credible evidence that test materials intended for administration in these regions have been compromised.\n4. The article also mentions that all students would get a refund and would only be able to resit when the tests are held again in September.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that hundreds of students in South Korea have had to wait until Monday to take part in the university entrance test, without providing any context or explanation for the delay. The article, on the other hand, provides a detailed explanation for the cancellation of the test, citing compromised test materials and a refund for all students.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
