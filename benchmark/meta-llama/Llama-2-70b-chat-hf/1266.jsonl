The summary claims that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England last year has more than doubled, which implies a significant increase from the previous year.\n3. However, the article only mentions a 200 million increase since 2013, which does not necessarily mean that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England last year has more than doubled.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article, it is unclear whether the number of plastic bags thrown away in England last year has more than doubled. The summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
