The summary states that the Northern Ireland Assembly has voted to introduce legislation to allow gay men to be convicted of sex offences.\n2. However, the article does not mention any voting or approval by the Northern Ireland Assembly to introduce legislation allowing gay men to be convicted of sex offences. Instead, it discusses the proposal to pardon men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, including living gay and bisexual men.\n3.

The article states that the Justice Minister Claire Sugden has confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, which aims to bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales regarding automatic pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offenses.\n2. The article mentions that the motion will contain provisions for both posthumous pardons and living men convicted of such offenses to apply for a pardon, similar to the law known as \"Turing's Law\" in England and Wales.\n3. The article quotes the minister saying that she has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offenses, and that arrangements will be brought in \"as soon as possible\" to ensure equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland as in England and Wales.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it seems that the assembly is considering legislation to pardon, not convict, gay men of sex offenses. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article, as it suggests the opposite.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
