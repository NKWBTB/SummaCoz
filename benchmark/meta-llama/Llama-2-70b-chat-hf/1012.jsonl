The article mentions that Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar, a Mongolian rapper, was beaten with a bottle and kicked in the face during a concert in Ulan Bator.\n2. The article also mentions that the Russian embassy is investigating the incident, but has called local press reports \"distorted\".\n3. The article notes that Sukhbaatar frequently wears a red deel with a swastika symbol on stage, which is a traditional symbol in Mongolia that pre-dates Hitler.\n4. The article mentions that the suspect in the beating is a Russian diplomatic officer, but does not mention anything about the suspect's status or immunity.\n5. The article ends by stating that the police are investigating the case and that the suspect has not been arrested.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is consistent with the information provided. All of the information in the summary is supported by the article, and there is no information in the summary that contradicts the article. Therefore, I would answer \"yes\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
