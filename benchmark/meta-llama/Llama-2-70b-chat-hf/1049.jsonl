{"document": "Brad McKay crouched to volley in Greg Tansey's deep free-kick early in the match.\nAnd Tansey converted a penalty after Massimo Donati had fouled Ross Draper.\nAccies were upset Ali Crawford was not awarded a second-half spot-kick for a challenge by goalkeeper Ryan Esson but netted late on through Danny Redmond.\nThe gap between Caley Thistle and Motherwell also stands at four points, with Well behind Hamilton on goal difference after losing to Ross County.\nThe first-half performance was exactly what Inverness manager Richie Foran has been searching for and came with their backs planted firmly against the wall.\nThey were terrific. Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people, although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time.\nForan has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going. They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns, at least temporarily, to sides above.\nTansey, who has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen, was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory. It was his delivery that found McKay ghosting in and the defender's finish was perfect.\nAnother Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground. Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure.\nIn truth, Inverness could have been out of sight by the break.\nBilly Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey's drive.\nAnd, in the second period, Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over.\nMartin Canning's side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham.\nAnd Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline. As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down.\nReferee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side.\nHaving offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm.\nDougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence.\nRedmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.\nMatch ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nSecond Half ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nGoal!
