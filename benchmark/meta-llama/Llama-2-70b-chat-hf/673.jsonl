The summary implies that a man accused of causing a pensioner's death by careless driving has told a court he was \"truly sorry\" he had been.\n2. However, the article does not mention that the accident resulted in the pensioner's death. It states that Sylvia Blackburn suffered serious head injuries but does not confirm her death. The article discusses Brian Wright's admission that he struck Mrs. Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. There is no mention of the man admitting to causing her death in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces information about the pensioner's death, while the article does not provide such information.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The summary states that the man accused of causing a pensioner's death by careless driving has apologized in court.\n2. The article mentions that the defendant, Brian Wright, apologized to the court for what he had done to the victim, Sylvia Blackburn, and her family.\n3. The summary does not mention the specific details of the accident or the charges against Wright, which are included in the article.\n4. The article mentions that Wright's VW Golf failed to stop for a red light, but the summary does not include this information.\n5. The summary focuses on Wright's apology, while the article provides more context and details about the accident and the trial.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not provide a complete representation of the information in the article, and it focuses on a single aspect of the story (Wright's apology) while leaving out other important details."}
