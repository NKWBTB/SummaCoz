The article states that Barcelona drew 1-1 with Real Madrid, while the summary states that Barcelona won 2-1. This discrepancy suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n2. The article quotes Luis Enrique as saying that Barcelona deserved to win and that they were the better team, but were unable to get the second goal, which allowed Real Madrid to equalize. The summary does not mention this.\n3. The article also mentions Andres Iniesta's return from injury and his impact on the game, setting up a chance for Lionel Messi with a brilliant through ball. The summary does not mention Iniesta's return or his impact on the game.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article, and it contains some inaccuracies, such as the incorrect score.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
