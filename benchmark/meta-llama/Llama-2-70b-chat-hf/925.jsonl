{"document": "Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man . A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.", "claim": "A Pennsylvania man was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to him The girl told investigators that Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com Authorities say Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to the Pottstown Mercury The girl told investigators that Rebbie would come into her", "label": 0, "model_name": "M20", "cnndm_id": "dm-test-2c6695b438980783754f7db28129ec2fbb3e6e21", "cut": "val", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "summeval", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "error", "doc_sents": ["Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man .", "A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom.", "Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said.", "The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors.", "She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep.", "She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com.", "Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered.", "Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said.", "The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors.", "Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury.", "'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific.", "It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury.", "The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown.", "Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail."], "sum_sents": ["A Pennsylvania man was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to him", "The girl told investigators that Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com", "Authorities say Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to the Pottstown Mercury", "The girl told investigators that Rebbie would come into her"], "rel_index": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9], "cot": "1.
