The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee.\n2. However, the article states that the man, Clive Weatherhogg, was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity with a man, and intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.\n3. The article does not mention anything about a 15-year-old girl being sexually abused.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man. The summary mentions that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee, which implies that the victim was a minor.\n2. The article states that Weatherhogg sent a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day. The summary does not mention this specific detail, but it does mention that the victim was 15 years old, which suggests that the clip was likely sent to a minor.\n3. The article mentions that Weatherhogg was placed on the sex offenders register and was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court. The summary does not mention the trial or the sex offenders register, but it does mention that the man was jailed, which suggests that he was found guilty of the charges.\n4. The article quotes Lady Wolffe as saying that Weatherhogg's conduct was \"abhorrent\" and that he posed a \"moderate risk\" of sexual re-offending. The summary does not mention these specific quotes, but it does mention that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl, which suggests that the judge considered the conduct to be serious and deserving of punishment.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, including the fact that a man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
