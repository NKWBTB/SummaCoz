Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary states that Radamel Falcao has struggled for Manchester United during his season-long loan. This is supported by the article, which mentions that Falcao has only scored four goals all season and that United are unlikely to take up the option to make his transfer permanent.\n2. The summary mentions that Louis van Gaal's side have to pay \u00a346million to make Falcao's transfer permanent. This is also supported by the article, which states that United will have to pay \u00a346million to make Falcao's transfer permanent.\n3. The summary states that Falcao has scored four goals in Louis van Gaal's side. This is a minor error, as the article actually states that Falcao has only scored four goals all season, not specifically under Van Gaal's management. However, this is a minor discrepancy and does not affect the overall consistency of the summary.\n4. The summary states that Falcao is not happy in France but thinks he would have been better off staying at Monaco. This is supported by the article, which quotes Falcao's former teammate Nabil Dirar as saying that Falcao was not happy in France and that he would have been better off staying at Monaco.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, and all the information in the summary is supported by the article. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
