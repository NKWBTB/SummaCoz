The article states that the fire occurred in the Sangomore area of Durness, which is not in County Antrim. Therefore, the summary is already inconsistent with the article in terms of location.\n2. The article does not mention anything about the fire being suspicious. In fact, Det Insp Richard Baird states that the fire is not thought to be suspicious. The summary, on the other hand, explicitly states that the police are investigating a suspicious fire.\n3. The article mentions that the damage caused by the fire has prevented entry to the property, and that structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter. The summary does not mention any of this.\n\nBased on the above points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The location, the nature of the fire, and the damage caused by the fire are all inconsistent between the two. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
