The MLS outfit have released a snippet of the music video for their track 'All The Way' which includes contributions by singer-songwriter Sarah Packiam, MC Sterlin and Villa. New York City ace Villa took to Twitter to provide his 6.96million followers with a chance of having a 'sneak peek' at his collaboration with the music duo. David Villa is all smiles as he provides backing vocals for New York City FC's new anthem . The 33-year-old stars in the music video along with Sarah Packiam and MC Sterlin . The full version of the song will be released on Wednesday ahead of New York City's opening game of the 2015 MLS campaign. Villa's first competitive match in America will see the former Barcelona ace go up against Kaka's Orlando City Soccer Club at the Citrus Bowl on Sunday. New York City fans will be hoping his highly-anticipated MLS debut is somewhat better than his laboured music video performance. Packiam and MC Sterlin take to the streets during the music video performance . Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday . Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d\u2019Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard \u2013 New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard \u2013 LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City\u2019s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York\u2019s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.", "claim": "frank lampard will postpone his move to new york city fc. the mls outfit have released a music video for their track 'all the way' the song will be released on wednesday ahead of the 2015 mls season. villa took to twitter on twitter to provide his 6.96 million followers. david villa is all smiles as he provides backing.", "cnndm_id": "8f7e3afbe7bf1fe8162a9f480df8d596363d8bee", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Frank Lampard will be thanking his lucky stars that he decided to postpone his move to New York City FC after seeing future team-mate David Villa's attempt at providing backing vocals for his side's new anthem.", "The MLS outfit have released a snippet of the music video for their track 'All The Way' which includes contributions by singer-songwriter Sarah Packiam, MC Sterlin and Villa.", "New York City ace Villa took to Twitter to provide his 6.96million followers with a chance of having a 'sneak peek' at his collaboration with the music duo.", "David Villa is all smiles as he provides backing vocals for New York City FC's new anthem .", "The 33-year-old stars in the music video along with Sarah Packiam and MC Sterlin .", "The full version of the song will be released on Wednesday ahead of New York City's opening game of the 2015 MLS campaign.", "Villa's first competitive match in America will see the former Barcelona ace go up against Kaka's Orlando City Soccer Club at the Citrus Bowl on Sunday.", "New York City fans will be hoping his highly-anticipated MLS debut is somewhat better than his laboured music video performance.", "Packiam and MC Sterlin take to the streets during the music video performance .", "Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday .", "Kaka - Orlando City SC .", "The Brazilian won the Ballon d\u2019Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City.", "He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass.", "Frank Lampard \u2013 New York City FC .", "One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league.", "Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years.", "He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City.", "Steven Gerrard \u2013 LA Galaxy .", "The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham.", "Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished.", "He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane.", "David Villa - New York City FC .", "Villa became New York City\u2019s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season.", "He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York\u2019s goals in their debut season.", "Bradley Wright Phillips - New York Red Bulls .", "Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls.", "He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games.", "With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term."], "sum_sents": ["frank lampard will postpone his move to new york city fc.", "the mls outfit have released a music video for their track 'all the way' the song will be released on wednesday ahead of the 2015 mls season.", "villa took to twitter on twitter to provide his 6.96 million followers.", "david villa is all smiles as he provides backing."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 22], "cot": "1.

The article provides details about David Villa's involvement in New York City FC's new anthem, including his collaboration with singer-songwriter Sarah Packiam and MC Sterlin, which is mentioned in the summary.\n3.

The article mentions other players joining MLS franchises, such as Kaka, Steven Gerrard, and Bradley Wright-Phillips, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on the above points, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article, as it only focuses on David Villa's involvement in New York City FC's anthem and his MLS debut, while leaving out other important information provided in the article.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
