The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that Pakistan's supreme court has lifted a ban on YouTube, but the article only mentions the ban was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012. Instead, the article states that the government has directed internet service providers to open access to YouTube.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that the ban on YouTube was lifted by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) after Google, the owner of YouTube, launched a Pakistan-specific version of the platform.\n2. The summary does not mention the launch of a Pakistan-specific version of YouTube, which is a key point in the article.\n3. The article mentions that YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content, but the summary does not include this information.\n4. The article includes quotes from a YouTube spokeswoman stating that government requests for content removal would not automatically be granted, and that requests would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report. The summary does not include this information.\n5. The article provides context on the initial ban on YouTube, which was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the upload of the controversial film Innocence of Muslims. The summary does not include this context.\n\nBased on the above points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not provide the full context and details provided in the article, and omits key information such as the launch of a Pakistan-specific version of YouTube and YouTube's stance on content removal requests from governments.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
