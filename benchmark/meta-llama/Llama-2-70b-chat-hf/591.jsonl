The summary states, \"The head teacher of a Birmingham school has been placed in special measures after being found guilty of misconduct.\"\n2. However, the article does not mention that the head teacher has been found guilty of misconduct or placed in special measures. The article discusses issues surrounding several Birmingham schools, including inadequate ratings by Ofsted, concerns about the way the schools are run, and potential consequences such as the termination of funding agreements. There is no specific mention of the head teacher's misconduct in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary providing information about the head teacher's alleged misconduct and placement in special measures, which is not supported by the article's content.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Park View and Nansen Primary schools will have their funding agreements terminated due to inadequate performance.\n2. The article also mentions that Oldknow Academy and Golden Hillock School were warned that they could lose funding unless they addressed concerns raised by Ofsted.\n3. The article quotes a head teacher at one of the Trojan Horse schools saying that parents tried to undermine her authority and that she heard parents speaking to an Ofsted inspector about her.\n4. The article mentions that the education minister, Lord Nash, has written to Park View and Oldknow academies, outlining concerns about the way the schools are run and giving them a deadline to respond.\n5. The article states that Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said that a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip in Birmingham schools.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the head teacher of a Birmingham school has been placed in special measures after being found guilty of misconduct, but the article does not mention anything about a head teacher being placed in special measures or found guilty of misconduct. Instead, it mentions that the funding agreements for certain schools will be terminated and that some schools have been warned about losing funding unless they address concerns raised by Ofsted. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
