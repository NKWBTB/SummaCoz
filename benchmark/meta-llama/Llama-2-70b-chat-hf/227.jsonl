Scroll down for video . Hussein Javadi took the picture in the window of his Barcelona hotel hours before he boarded the flight . Mr Javadi was killed along with 150 other people when the plane crashed into the Alps . Rescue workers sift through the wreckage of\u00a0Germanwings Airbus A320 which was deliberately flown into the French Alps . Mr Javadi, along with fellow Iranian sports journalist\u00a0Milad Hojatoleslami, were travelling to Austria, where they were due to cover a match between Iran and Chile. But they never reached their destination, as the plane was plunged into the Alps by German pilot Andreas G\u00fcnter Lubitz, killing all 150 people on board the flight to Dussedorf. Mr Javadi's long-time friend Maysam Biz\u00e6r - who shared the picture on his Twitter account after learning of the tragedy - told the Evening Standard: 'He was a kind, loving and caring man with high passion for his work and football.' The heartbreaking picture of Mr Javadi, who worked for Vatan Emrooz newspaper, is just one of the traces left behind of the passengers' final hours. Many of the 16 German schoolchildren, who had been in Barcelona on an exchange, messaged friends and family as they boarded the plane. Among them were 16-year-old Elena Bless, who friends described as a \u2018happy girl\u2019 who dreamed of going to university and travelling the world. Germanwings co-pilot -\u00a028-year-old German Andreas G\u00fcnter Lubitz (above) - deliberately crashed into a mountain to 'destroy the plane', it has been revealed . These are some of the German pupils who died on the Germanwings flight, which crashed in the Alps, killing all 150 passengers. The teenagers had been on a week-long exchange trip to Barcelona and were flying home . \u2018She had been sending me messages on WhatsApp and Snap Chat and had been very happy about the trip. She had had a good time.\u2019 Elena\u2019s best friend and classmate Philippa said. \u2018She sent me pictures of the group together and the different sights they saw. They looked like they had had fun.\u2019 Investigators have since revealed how the 28-year-old pilot locked his captain out of the cockpit in the moments before the aircraft was downed. The chilling final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said Lubitz's sole aim was to 'destroy the plane'. 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit. 'His (Lubitz's) breath was not of somebody who was struggling. He never said a single word. It was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes. Nothing. 'There are alarm systems which indicate to all those on board the proximity of the ground. Then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door. 'The door is reinforced according to international standards. 'Just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact. It's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact. 'There is no distress signal or Mayday signal. No answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower. 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds. 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'He did this for a reason which we don't know why, but we can only deduct that he destroyed this plane. 'We have asked for information from the German investigation on both his profession and personal background. 'There is no reason to suspect a terrorist attack. 'People who commit suicide usually do so alone... I don't call it a suicide.'", "claim": "hussein javadi took the picture in his barcelona hotel hours before he boarded the flight. hussein javadi took the picture in the window of hespiria hespiria. he had been in the spanish city to cover 'el clasico', football match. mr javadi died along with 150 other people when the plane crashed into the alps. the haunting images of the 'kind and caring' iranian sports journalist taken in the window of his barcelona hotel.", "cnndm_id": "b2a0ae2d20a708fd4eb1d2293ef4ead255194ba5", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["This is the haunting last picture of a 'kind and caring' Iranian sports journalist, taken in the window of his Barcelona hotel hours before he boarded the doomed Germanwings flight.", "Hussein Javadi took the picture in the window of Hotel Hespiria before he departed for the airport on Tuesday morning, sharing it on his private Instagram account.", "He had been in the Spanish city to cover 'El Clasico', a football match between Barcelona and Real Madrid -
