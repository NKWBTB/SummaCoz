The summary claims that supermarkets of state-run paper in Singapore have been canceled due to the haze, while the article states that only seven firms, including major supermarkets, have been asked to declare that they are not sourcing materials from companies suspected of contributing to the haze.\n2. The summary uses the phrase \"state-run paper paper,\" which is not a correct phrase. The article does not mention anything about a state-run paper company, and it is likely that the summary is a typo or a misunderstanding.\n3.

The article mentions that seven firms, including NTUC FairPrice, have been asked to declare that they are not sourcing materials from companies suspected of contributing to the haze.\n2. The article specifically mentions that FairPrice has removed products from one Indonesian firm, Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), following the government's notification.\n3. The article also mentions that the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) have asked retailers to declare their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and environmentally friendly practices.\n4. The summary states that Singapore's state-run paper has cancelled all of its supermarkets because of the haze caused by the air.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about Singapore's state-run paper cancelling all of its supermarkets. Instead, it mentions that FairPrice, a state-owned supermarket giant, has removed products from one Indonesian firm suspected of contributing to the haze. Additionally, the article mentions that retailers have been asked to declare their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and environmentally friendly practices, but it does not mention anything about cancelling supermarkets.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
