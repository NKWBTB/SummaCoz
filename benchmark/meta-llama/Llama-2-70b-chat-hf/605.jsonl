The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee.\n2. However, the article does not mention that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. The article discusses Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister. The charges and sentences in the article are related to Clive Weatherhogg's actions, not those of a 15-year-old girl.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary' statement is not mentioned in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man, and that he was also convicted of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.\n2. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee.\n3. The article does not mention the age of the victim, but it does state that the woman felt \"blackmailed\" by Weatherhogg, which suggests that she was not a willing participant in the sexual activities.\n4. The article also mentions that Weatherhogg was placed on the sex offenders register and that he poses a moderate risk of sexual re-offending.\n\nBased on my reasoning, I would answer (yes) the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary accurately reflects the information in the article, which states that Weatherhogg was jailed for sexually abusing a woman, and that he also engaged in other inappropriate sexual behavior. The age of the victim is not specified in the article, but the fact that Weatherhogg was convicted of coercing her into sexual activity suggests that she was not an adult and therefore could have been a minor."}
