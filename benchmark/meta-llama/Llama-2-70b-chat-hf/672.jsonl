The summary implies that a lollipop lady has been blinded in a \"world upside down\" after admitting causing the death of a lollipop lady.\n2. However, the article does not mention that anyone has been blinded or that a lollipop lady has admitted causing the death of another lollipop lady. The article primarily discusses an accident involving Brian Wright, who is accused of causing serious injury to Sylvia Blackburn, a lollipop lady, and denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The article does not mention any death or a lollipop lady admitting to causing another lollipop lady's death.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces incorrect information about blindness, a lollipop lady's admission of causing death, and a \"world upside down,\" which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article states that Sylvia Blackburn, a lollipop lady, suffered serious head injuries after being hit by a car driven by Brian Wright.\n2. The summary states that a lollipop lady has been blinded, which is not explicitly stated in the article. However, it can be inferred that Mrs. Blackburn's serious head injuries may have resulted in some form of vision loss or blindness.\n3. The article mentions that Brian Wright accepted that he had struck Mrs. Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. In contrast, the summary states that Wright has admitted causing the death of a lollipop lady, which is not accurate according to the article.\n4. The article provides details about the circumstances of the incident, including the fact that the sun was setting and may have been shining into Mr. Wright's eyes. The summary does not mention these details.\n\nBased on the above, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary contains some inaccuracies and omits important details, which suggests that it may not accurately represent the content of the article."}
