Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport, which is consistent with the summary's mention of new flights between Inverness and Amsterdam.\n2. The article also mentions an evening flight from Schiphol, which is not explicitly mentioned in the summary, but it does not contradict it either.\n3. The article states that the flights will allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home, which is consistent with the summary's implication that the flights will operate between Inverness and Amsterdam.\n4. The article mentions that KLM started Inverness-Amsterdam flights last year, which is not mentioned in the summary, but it does not contradict it either.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article, the summary is consistent with it.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
