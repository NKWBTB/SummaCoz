The summary, on the other hand, states that millions of people are being urged not to renew their tax credits.\n4. Based on the information in the article, there is no evidence to support the claim that millions of people are being urged not to renew their tax credits. In fact, the article emphasizes the importance of renewing tax credits and warns of the consequences of not doing so.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
