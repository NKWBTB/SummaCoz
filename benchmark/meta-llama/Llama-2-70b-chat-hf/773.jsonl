{"document": "Four burly Swedish cops put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty on a Manhattan subway train last night. The friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We\u2019ve been here one day. We\u2019re no heroes, just tourists,'\u00a0Makrus \u00c5sberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the\u00a0New York Post. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik N\u00e4slund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus \u00c5sberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said. When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Mis\u00e9rables.

The summary implies that the Swedish cops, who were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway, put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a Manhattan subway train.\n2.

They then sprang into action to stop the assault. The summary incorrectly suggests that the assault occurred after the friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly implies the timing of the assault, suggesting it happened while the friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables, while the article states that they were already on the subway train when they intervened.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that the four Swedish police officers were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway when they were called to duty on a Manhattan subway train. The summary mentions that the friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a Manhattan subway train last night. This is consistent.\n2. The article quotes Makrus \u00c5sberg, one of the officers, saying, \"We came here for vacation. We're no heroes, just tourists.\" The summary also mentions that the Swedish cops said they were \"no heroes\" and just tourists. This is consistent.\n3. The article states that the officers subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The summary mentions that the friends found a homeless man in the fight on the train. This is consistent.\n4. The article mentions that the officers kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene. The summary does not mention this detail, but it does not contradict it either.\n5. The article provides the ages of the four officers: Makrus \u00c5sberg, 25; Erik Naslund, 26; Samuel Kvarzell, 25; and Eric Jansberger, 28. The summary does not mention the ages of the officers, but it does not contradict the information provided in the article either.\n\nTherefore, based on the above points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes."}
