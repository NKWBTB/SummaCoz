Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that a device believed to be a World War Two munition was found in the city, which aligns with the summary's mention of a World War Two bomb.\n2. The article states that the device was found in the city, and the summary specifies that it was found in a street in Sheffield, which is a city in South Yorkshire.\n3. The article mentions that roads around Matilda Street were sealed off and traffic was diverted, which suggests that the device was found in a public area, consistent with the summary's mention of a street.\n4. The article states that the area was declared safe by South Yorkshire Police after four hours, which implies that the device was successfully defused or removed, consistent with the summary's lack of mention of any casualties or damage.\n5. The article mentions that three devices were uncovered in the same area last Wednesday, which suggests that the area has recently been a location of concern for bomb disposal authorities, consistent with the summary's mention of a World War Two bomb being found.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary accurately summarizes the information in the article, and therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
