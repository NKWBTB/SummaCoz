The summary implies that the prison secretary has stated that inmates at a prison in Essex have been left \"notorious\" because of a \"breakdown.\"\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison and the concerns of residents and former inmates. It mentions a former inmate's claim about the use of drones for smuggling but does not mention a statement from the prison secretary about inmates being \"notorious\" due to a \"breakdown.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which attributes a statement to the prison secretary that is not found in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that Chelmsford Prison has had \"numerous incidents\" of packages being thrown over the wall, and a former inmate claims that the prison is \"notorious\" for the amount of contraband that enters the facility.\n2. The Ministry of Justice states that staff work hard to prevent contraband from entering prisons, but acknowledges that more needs to be done.\n3. A resident living near the prison reports witnessing packages being thrown over the wall multiple times, and expresses concern about the situation.\n4. The former inmate claims that drones are used to smuggle contraband into the prison, but the Ministry of Justice denies this.\n5. The article mentions that laws have been introduced to punish those who smuggle packages over prison walls with up to two years in jail.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that there is a problem with contraband entering Chelmsford Prison, and that efforts are being made to address the issue. However, the summary's statement that inmates at the prison have been left \"notorious\" due to a \"breakdown\" is not supported by the information in the article. The article does not mention any breakdown or failure of the prison system, but rather a problem with contraband smuggling that is being addressed through increased efforts and new laws.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
