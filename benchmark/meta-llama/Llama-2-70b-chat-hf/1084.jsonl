The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The article only mentions that FairPrice is removing products from one Indonesian firm, APP, due to the government's notification.\n2. The summary is an overstatement and misleading because it implies that FairPrice is taking action to remove the haze, when in fact, they are only removing products from one firm.\n3. The article provides more specific and accurate information about FairPrice's actions, whereas the summary is a general statement that is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf": "  My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The article mentions that NTUC FairPrice, a major supermarket chain in Singapore, has been asked to declare that it is not sourcing products from companies suspected of contributing to the haze in Indonesia.\n2. The article specifically mentions Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP) as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze, and notes that FairPrice has committed to removing all paper products sourced from APP.\n3. The article also mentions that the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) have asked retailers to declare their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and to show their support for environmentally friendly practices.\n4. The summary, on the other hand, simply states that FairPrice is removing the haze caused by fires in Indonesia and Indonesia.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that FairPrice is taking steps to address the issue of the haze by removing products sourced from companies suspected of contributing to the problem. However, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it implies that FairPrice is somehow physically removing the haze itself, rather than simply committing to sustainable procurement practices.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
