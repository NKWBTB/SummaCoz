The summary states that a woman has been sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against a woman and a woman.\n2. However, the article does not mention a woman being sentenced for sex offenses. The article discusses the case of Clive Weatherhogg, a man who was found guilty of coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man. The charges and sentences in the article are related to Clive Weatherhogg, a man, not a woman.\n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. The article states that Clive Weatherhogg, a 42-year-old man, was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with another man. The summary, on the other hand, states that a woman has been sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against a woman and a man.\n2. The article mentions that Weatherhogg was placed on the sex offenders register and was remitted to the High Court in Edinburgh for sentencing due to its greater sentencing powers. The summary does not mention anything about the sex offenders register or the High Court.\n3. The article quotes the judge, Lady Wolffe, as saying that Weatherhogg's conduct was \"abhorrent\" and that he posed a \"moderate risk\" of sexual re-offending. The summary does not mention anything about the judge's comments or the risk assessment.\n4. The summary implies that the woman was the perpetrator of the sex offences, whereas the article makes it clear that Weatherhogg was the one who committed the offences.\n\nTherefore, based on the inconsistencies between the summary and the article, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
