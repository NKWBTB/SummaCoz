However, the article discusses the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is a British-Iranian woman, not a British woman. Additionally, the article doesn't mention anyone expressing being \"thrilled\" by the case.\n3.

The article mentions that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British woman, has been imprisoned in Iran for over a year, and her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has been critical of the UK government's lack of action in securing her release.\n2. The article states that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been sentenced to five years in jail on charges that have not been disclosed, and that her appeal is being held in secret.\n3. The article quotes Mr. Ratcliffe as saying that his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK, and that he believes the appeal outcome is unpredictable.\n4. The article mentions that Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has spent time in solitary confinement and has started a hunger strike, but has since been moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.\n5. The article states that Mr. Ratcliffe is trying to get a visa to visit his wife and daughter in Iran.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, the summary \"the wife of a british woman who has been imprisoned in iran for more than a decade has said he is `thrilled' by the case\" is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about the wife of a British woman being imprisoned for over a decade, nor does it mention anyone being \"thrilled\" by the case.\n\nTherefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
