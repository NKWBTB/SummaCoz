The article states that a nuclear submarine caught on fire at a Russian shipyard, and the summary reports the same information.\n2. The article mentions that the fire started in the rubber insulation between the submarine's light and pressure hull, and the summary specifically quotes the RIA Novosti news agency as saying that the insulation caught on fire.\n3. The article provides additional details about the submarine's location, the fact that there is no ammunition on board, and that the fire presents no threat to people or the shipyard.
