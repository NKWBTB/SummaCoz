The article also mentions Ciaran Monaghan and Ewan Sutherland, both of whom are leaving the council under a voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.\n3. The leader of the opposition SNP group, Stephen Flynn, comments on the departures, suggesting that they are indicative of the council's inability to hold on to senior staff and predicting further departures in the coming months.\n4. The council's chief executive, Angela Scott, thanks the trio for their dedication and professionalism.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the chief executive of a highland council has resigned, but the article does not mention the chief executive resigning. Instead, it mentions the departures of Richard Ellis, Ciaran Monaghan, and Ewan Sutherland, who are all senior staff members but not the chief executive. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
