Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the incident happened near Dr Gray's Hospital, while the summary only mentions the A96 in County Antrim. This information is not consistent, as the article provides a specific location for the incident, while the summary only provides a general location.\n2. The article states that the man was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries, while the summary does not mention any information about the man's injuries. This information is not consistent, as the article provides specific information about the man's injuries, while the summary does not.\n3. The article states that the A96 was closed in the area for several hours, but it has since reopened, while the summary does not mention anything about the road being closed or reopened. This information is not consistent, as the article provides information about the impact of the incident on the road, while the summary does not.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide all the information that is supported by the article, and it contains some information that is not present in the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
