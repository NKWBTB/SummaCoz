However, the article does not mention a theatre in Kent undergoing such a project, nor does it discuss a \u00a31 million project to build a new theatre in the grounds of Alexandra Palace. The article is primarily about the restoration and renovation of Alexandra Palace's existing theatre in North London.\n3.

The summary states that the theatre is in Kent, which is a different location in the UK.\n3. The article mentions that the theatre has been unused for decades, but the summary does not provide any information about the current state of the theatre.\n4. The article mentions that the restoration project includes refurbishing the BBC studios, which are located at the eastern end of the Palace, but the summary does not mention anything about the BBC or the studios.\n5. The article mentions that the project aims to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination, but the summary does not provide any information about the purpose of the new theatre or the broader restoration project.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides incomplete and inaccurate information about the theatre and the restoration project, and it does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
