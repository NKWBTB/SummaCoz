However, the summary states that Sidwell has signed a new three-year contract with the Championship club.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention Sidwell signing a new three-year contract with Brighton & Hove Albion. Instead, it mentions that he is hoping to sign a new deal, but there is no mention of the length of the contract or whether it has been signed. The summary provides incorrect information and is not consistent with the article."}
