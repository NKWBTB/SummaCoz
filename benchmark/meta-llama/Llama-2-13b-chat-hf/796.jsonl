{"document": "Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The\u00a0bizarre\u00a0post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements. Adebayor has only one year left to run on his current contract at Tottenham and could leave this summer Adebayor sees a shot saved by Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan (left) during the match in November Adebayor recently insisted that he was prepared to fight for his place in the Tottenham team The form of Spurs academy graduate Harry Kane (left) has seen Adebayor pushed down the pecking order Adebayor poses for a photo on Instagram as the the striker takes a break in Paris", "claim": "emmanuel adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at white hart lane . adebayor joined spurs in 2011 from manchester city on loan . the togo international posted a video of him dancing in the arc de triomphe .", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "1d7372a702e28387412146f1822625a36c8f828f", "model_name": "bus", "annotations": [0, 0, 1], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "CircE", "doc_sents": ["Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike.", "After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why.", "The\u00a0bizarre\u00a0post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team.", "Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future.", "Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe", "The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer.", "Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October.", "Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.", "Adebayor has only one year left to run on his current contract at Tottenham and could leave this summer", "Adebayor sees a shot saved by Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan (left) during the match in November Adebayor recently insisted that he was prepared to fight for his place in the Tottenham team The form of Spurs academy graduate Harry Kane (left) has seen Adebayor pushed down the pecking order Adebayor poses for a photo on Instagram as the the striker takes a break in Paris"], "sum_sents": ["emmanuel adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at white hart lane .", "adebayor joined spurs in 2011 from manchester city on loan .", "the togo international posted a video of him dancing in the arc de triomphe ."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5], "cot": "1.

The summary implies that Emmanuel Adebayor has one year left on his current contract at White Hart Lane, joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City on loan, and posted a video of himself dancing in the Arc de Triomphe.\n2.

The article does not specify the remaining duration of Adebayor's contract. Additionally, while the article talks about Adebayor's recent bizarre dance video in front of the Arc de Triomphe, it does not mention any specific details about his contract status.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The summary states that Emmanuel Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane. This is consistent with the article, which states that Adebayor has one year left on his current contract at Tottenham.\n2. The summary mentions that Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City on loan. This is correct, as the article states that Adebayor initially joined Spurs on loan from Manchester City before the club made the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer.\n3. The summary mentions that Adebayor posted a video of himself dancing in the Arc de Triomphe. This is not mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on my analysis, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. The summary leaves out information about Adebayor's goal return and the rise of Harry Kane, which are important details mentioned in the article. Additionally, the summary includes a detail about Adebayor dancing in the Arc de Triomphe, which is not mentioned in the article. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
