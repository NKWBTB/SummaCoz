Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Lower Bristol Road was closed at Rackfield Place outside the First depot due to a crash involving two commuters.\n2. The article mentions that the road closure caused disruption and delays to commuters and bus services during rush hour.\n3. The article states that investigations are underway into how the collision happened.\n4. The article mentions that First bus services were affected by the crash and that it would take a few hours for all services to return to normal.\n5. The article quotes the managing director of First, James Freeman, as saying that they hope to have a full service running in time for the evening commute and thanking the public for their support and understanding.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions a major road reopening in Bristol, but the article provides more details about the crash and its impact on commuters and bus services. The summary does not mention any of the specific details mentioned in the article, such as the location of the crash, the time of the closure, or the impact on bus services."}
