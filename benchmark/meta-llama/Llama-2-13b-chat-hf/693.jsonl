However, the article in question discusses a 1.5 magnitude tremor in Lancashire that led to the suspension of shale gas drilling.

The summary states that the UK's oil and gas authority (NDA) is investigating the discovery of a massive earthquake in the UK, but there is no mention of this in the article. In fact, the article states that Cuadrilla has suspended drilling as a precaution after a 1.5 magnitude tremor was detected, and that the BGS is monitoring fracking as a precaution.
