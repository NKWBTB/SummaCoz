The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. Men faced a choice -- convert to Islam or be shot. But the Islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves. In its fourth edition of \"Dabiq,\" the ISIS online magazine, an article titled \"The revival of slavery before the hour,\" outlines the group's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the Yazidis. \"One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar (infidels) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of Shariah,\" the article reads. We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things. \"They separated all of us,\" she says. \"They dragged us away by our hair. They took married women, young ones. The youngest with us was just 10.  We were all crying. \"They said we are going to marry you off, you will forget your family.\" ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK . For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice. The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held. \"They would line about 50 of us up at a time, in rows of 10.  They would say don't move, don't cry or we will beat you. The men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased,\" she recalls. She was eventually chosen, part of a group of 25.  From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS . Two ISIS fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves. \"They brought in a Yazidi girl who had been with them for two months. She was wearing the black niqab. They said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her,\" Hanan says. \"The girl spoke to us in Kurdish and said they beat me, they cuffed me and raped me.\" Hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape. That night they crawled out the bedroom window. \"The fourth girl jumped out, I was the fifth. I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight,\" she tells me. \"They caught the last two girls.\" They ran, and somehow evaded capture.  Four hours later they were out of ISIS territory. \"If I just see someone with a beard I start shaking,\" Hanan says. Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article discusses how ISIS has taken thousands of Yazidi women and girls as sex slaves, and how they have been subjected to physical and emotional abuse, including rape and torture.\n2. The article mentions that ISIS has justified their actions by citing Shariah law, which they claim allows them to enslave non-Muslim women and girls.\n3. The article highlights the story of Hanan, a 19-year-old Yazidi girl who was taken as a sex slave by ISIS and was subjected to physical and emotional abuse.\n4. The article notes that Hanan and other Yazidi women and girls have been treated like cattle and have been subjected to forced marriages and rape.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the ISIS magazine article titled \"The Revival of Slavery,\" but the article provides much more detailed information about the experiences of Yazidi women and girls who have been taken as sex slaves by ISIS. The summary does not mention any of the specific examples or stories that are included in the article, such as Hanan's experience or the treatment of Yazidi women and girls as cattle. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
