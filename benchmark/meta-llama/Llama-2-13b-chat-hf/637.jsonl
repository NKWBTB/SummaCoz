There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"", "claim": "the scottish government has been accused of ``burying the size of taxation\\'\\'by the scottish government.", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "33811105", "model_name": "TConvS2S", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "xsum", "error_type": "EntE", "doc_sents": ["Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this", "linkA", "review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system.", "It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.", "The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.", "Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.", "He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.", "But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.", "Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.", "Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.", "But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated.", "There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.", "He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.", "\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So", "whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.", "\"The", "commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.", "A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".", "He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.", "\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\""], "sum_sents": ["the scottish government has been accused of ``burying the size of taxation\\'\\'by the scottish government."], "rel_index": [3, 5, 19], "cot": "1.

However, the article does not contain any statement or information that directly accuses the Scottish government of burying the size of taxation.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Scottish government has set up a cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives to the current council tax system.\n2. The commission, led by Professor Kenneth Gibb, has reviewed different systems of local taxation across the world and found that a local income tax is generally perceived as fairer.\n3. However, the commission also found that a local income tax creates difficulties for local authorities because it means their income fluctuates and there is little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.\n4. The article quotes Professor Gibb as saying that \"it is clear there is no magic bullet\" for reforming the council tax system, and that past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult.\n5. The Scottish government spokesman is quoted as saying that ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\", and that they have established the commission to examine fairer alternatives.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary implies that the Scottish government has been accused of \"burying the size of taxation\", but there is no mention of this in the article. Instead, the article focuses on the commission's review of local taxation systems and the challenges of reforming the council tax system."}
