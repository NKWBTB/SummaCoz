Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Jillian Bell, a star of 22 Jump Street, is on the red carpet in Los Angeles. This suggests that the event being described is a film awards ceremony, as the red carpet is a common feature of such events.\n2. The article states that the ceremony is \"unofficial\" and features fan-voted awards, which suggests that it is not one of the major film awards like the Oscars.\n3. The article mentions that The Fault in Our Stars won best movie, and that its star Shailene Woodley won best female performance, the Trailblazer Award, and best kiss. This suggests that the awards being given out are not the Oscars, as the Oscars do not have a \"best movie\" category or a \"Trailblazer Award.\"\n4. The article mentions that Bradley Cooper won best male performance for his role in American Sniper, and that Channing Tatum won best comedic performance for 22 Jump Street. These awards are not given out at the Oscars.\n5. The article mentions that Meryl Streep won best villain for her role in Into the Woods, which is not a category at the Oscars.\n6. The article mentions that Kevin Hart brought his kids on stage to accept the comedic genius award, and that Robert Downey Jr. was given the Generation Award. These awards are not given out at the Oscars.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions JK Rowling, who is not mentioned in the article, and implies that the event being described is the Oscars, which is not the case. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
