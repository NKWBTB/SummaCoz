Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The summary states that Manchester City midfielder Marcos Lopes could remain in Lille.\n2. The article states that Lopes is on a season-long loan with Lille, and that he has made 19 appearances in all competitions to date.\n3. The summary does not mention anything about Lopes' loan spell with Lille, only that he could remain in the club.\n4. The article states that Lopes has a contract with Manchester City, but that he feels at home at Lille and it is possible he will stay.\n5. The summary does not mention anything about Lopes' contract with Manchester City or his feelings about staying at Lille.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary does not fully capture all of the information in the article. Specifically, the summary does not mention Lopes' loan spell with Lille or his contract with Manchester City. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
