Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Swansea City manager Neil Curtis and assistant manager Paul Williams will take charge of the match against Bournemouth after Bob Bradley's sacking.\n2. The article also mentions that Swansea want to appoint a new boss as soon as possible, with ex-Derby manager Paul Clement being the first choice.\n3. Curtis believes that the current Swansea squad is good enough to stay up, and he reminds every new signing of how far the club has come.\n4. Curtis urges his players to \"get back up\" if they are to leave the Premier League.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions Curtis urging his players to \"get back up,\" but the article provides more context and information about Swansea's current situation, including their desire to appoint a new manager and the challenges they face in the Premier League. The summary does not capture all of this information, so it is not consistent with the article."}
