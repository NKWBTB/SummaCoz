Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Mr. Abbott told Australian media that the only way to prevent people dying at sea is to \"stop the boats.\" This is consistent with the summary, which mentions Mr. Abbott accusing the media of trying to stop migrants from hiding their boats.\n2. The article goes on to say that Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere. This is not mentioned in the summary.\n3. The article quotes the New York Times describing Australia's policy as \"brutal\" and \"inhumane,\" and says that it is \"dubious\" and \"strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war.\" The summary does not mention this.\n4. The article states that Mr. Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying that IS is worse than the Nazis. This is not mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary only mentions Mr. Abbott's comments about the media, but leaves out important details about Australia's policy on migrants and Mr. Abbott's controversial statements about IS and the Nazis. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
