The article states that the incident occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness, while the summary states that the crash occurred on the A9 between Dumfries and Galloway. These two locations are not the same, and the summary does not provide any information about the location of the crash.\n2. The article mentions that several other people received minor injuries in the crash, while the summary does not mention any injuries.\n3. The article states that the road was closed and diversions were put in place via the A897 Helmsdale to Melvich road, while the summary does not mention anything about the road being closed or diversions being put in place.\n4. The article mentions that police inquiries into the incident are ongoing, while the summary does not provide any information about the status of the investigation.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides incomplete and inaccurate information about the incident, and it does not support all of the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
