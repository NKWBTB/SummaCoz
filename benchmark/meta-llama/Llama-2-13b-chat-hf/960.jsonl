Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that Vanessa Santillan was found dead in a flat in Fulham, south west London, at the end of March. The summary does not mention the location of her death.\n2. The article states that Vanessa suffered injuries to her head and neck, and the summary does not mention any specific injuries.\n3. The article states that police are appealing to anyone who may have had contact with Vanessa in the hours before her death. The summary does not mention this.\n4. The article states that Vanessa was a transgender escort, but the summary does not mention her profession.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important details such as the location of her death, the specific injuries she suffered, and her profession, which are all mentioned in the article. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
