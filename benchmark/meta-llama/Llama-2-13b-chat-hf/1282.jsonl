Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the Welsh government has called on the UK government to address the impact of high energy prices on industry.\n2. The article also mentions that the Welsh government has set up an industry-led task group to gather examples of good procurement practices and to identify support other EU countries have provided to their steel industries.\n3. The article states that the steel industry in Wales has suffered a 39% decline in the five years to 2013, according to GVA figures.\n4. The article quotes the economy spokesman for Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth, as saying that the troubles in the steel industry are a \"canary in the mine\" and that there are deeper problems across a range of industries.\n5. The article mentions that the economy minister has set up an industry-led task group to gather examples of good procurement practices and to identify support other EU countries have provided to their steel industries.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the loss of 1,000 jobs at Wales' biggest steelworks, while the article discusses a range of industries and the broader economic challenges facing Wales. The article also mentions the Welsh government's efforts to address these challenges and support the steel industry, which is not mentioned in the summary."}
