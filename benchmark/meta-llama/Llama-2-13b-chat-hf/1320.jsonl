The summary only mentions that a man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, but it does not provide any details about the location or circumstances of the murder.\n4. The article provides details about the location of the murder (Stanley Meat Market in Liverpool) and the circumstances (the victim was shot in the head and chest).\n5. The article also mentions that the three Liverpool men arrested remain in police custody for questioning, which suggests that they are suspects in the murder.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not provide any details about the location or circumstances of the murder, while the article provides specific details about the location and circumstances. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
