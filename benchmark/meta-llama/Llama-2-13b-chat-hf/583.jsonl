The article mentions that the festival will take place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis from 19 to 22 July, but the summary does not provide any information about the date or location of the festival.\n3. The article mentions that the festival will feature acts such as The Waterboys, Imelda May, Lucy Spraggan, Skerryvore, Peatbog Faeries, and Dougie MacLean, but the summary does not mention any specific acts.\n4. The article mentions that the festival will offer an augmented reality experience, allowing visitors to access online information and interviews, buy tickets, and get a taste of the festival's atmosphere from anywhere in the world, but the summary does not mention anything about an augmented reality experience.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide any specific information about the festival, such as the date, location, or acts, and it does not mention the augmented reality experience that is a key feature of the festival, according to the article. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
