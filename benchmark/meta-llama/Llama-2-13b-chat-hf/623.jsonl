The summary states that a survey found that children who eat healthily are too fussy to eat healthily and that children have been cooked and cooked.\n2. However, the article does not discuss children being too fussy to eat healthily or being cooked and cooked. The article primarily focuses on children trying new foods at school, their preferences for certain vegetables, and the role of school meals in encouraging them to try new foods. The article also mentions parents giving packed lunches due to perceived fussiness, but it doesn't include the concept of children being \"cooked and cooked.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting information that is not supported by the article, creating a misrepresentation of the content.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. This suggests that children are being exposed to a variety of new foods at school, which is consistent with the idea that they are trying new things.\n2. The article also states that half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. This suggests that children are not only trying new foods at school, but they are also requesting them at home, which is consistent with the idea that they are enjoying the foods they are being served.\n3. The article mentions that the most popular vegetables among children were carrots, sweetcorn, and peas, while the least popular were aubergine, chickpeas, and spinach. This suggests that children are open to trying a variety of vegetables, but may be less fond of certain ones.\n4. The article quotes a parent as saying that school meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and increase the variety of foods in their diet. This suggests that parents are using school meals as an opportunity to expose their children to new foods and promote healthy eating habits.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary suggests that children are too fussy to eat healthily, but the article suggests that children are open to trying new foods and are enjoying the school meals they are being served. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
