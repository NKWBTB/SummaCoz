The article does not mention anything about a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.5m for 2015. It only states that Harbro Group saw a pre-tax profit increase of \u00a3800,000 to \u00a33.5m in the year to the end of June 2016.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Harbro Group, an Aberdeenshire-based company, saw a pre-tax profit increase of \u00a3800,000 to \u00a33.5m in the year to the end of June 2016.\n2. The article also states that the company's turnover fell by \u00a31m to just over \u00a3100m.\n3. The article mentions that the company has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand, and that these stores cater to farming and rural communities with a range of products.\n4. The article quotes the company as saying that the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict, but that they are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges Brexit may bring.\n\nNow, let's compare this information to the summary:\n\nThe summary states that the Scottish dairy industry has reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.5m for 2015.\n\nThere are a few issues with this summary:\n\n1. The article is not about the Scottish dairy industry, it's about Harbro Group, an Aberdeenshire-based company.\n2. The summary mentions a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.5m for 2015, but the article does not mention any specific year for the financial results.\n3. The summary does not mention any information about the company's turnover or international sales, which are both mentioned in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains inaccuracies and omissions that do not accurately reflect the information in the article."}
