The Scottish Transport Minister, Humza Yousaf, said that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage under the new charter basis.\n\nBased on the information in the article, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions a \"row over pay and conditions\" for northern isles cargo boats, but the article provides much more detail about the specific issue of seafarers' pay and the efforts to resolve the dispute. The summary does not mention the new charter arrangement, the RMT union's claims, or the involvement of Serco Northlink and Seatruck. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article."}
