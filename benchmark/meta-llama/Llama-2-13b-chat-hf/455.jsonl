However, the article mentions that Unite, a labor union representative, had productive talks with the new owners and received guarantees that all current agreements, including pension arrangements, would be honored.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies the new owners are against the existing pension scheme, while the article states that the new owners are committed to continuing the current pension arrangements and even wish to invest in the business to make it more profitable.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the new owners, Ranjit Boparan, have given guarantees that all current agreements will be honored, including the pension scheme.\n2. The article also states that the existing pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that current employees have an alternative pension scheme that is unaffected by the takeover.\n3. The summary states that the new owners are \"dismayed\" that a new pension scheme will be held in the UK.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the new owners are not dismayed about the pension scheme, but rather have given guarantees that all current agreements will be honored. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nSo, the answer is: NO. The summary is not consistent with the article."}
