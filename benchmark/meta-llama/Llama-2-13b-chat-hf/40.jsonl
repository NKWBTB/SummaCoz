The summary only mentions that Ayew netted six during the Africa Cup of Nations, but it does not specify how many of those goals were scored for Ghana.\n3. Therefore, the summary does not provide enough information to confirm that Ayew scored six goals for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides partial information about Ayew's performance in the Africa Cup of Nations, and it does not accurately reflect the full information provided in the article."}
