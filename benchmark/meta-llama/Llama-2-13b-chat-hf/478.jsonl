Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the RSPCA has confirmed that the cats near Victor Avenue in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire have ingested a toxic substance, but it is unclear whether the poisonings were accidental or deliberate.\n2. The summary states that a cat has died of antifreeze poisoning after eating antifreeze in a car park.\n3. The article does not mention anything about the cat dying in a car park. Instead, it states that the cat died at home after showing symptoms of foaming at the mouth and trying to be sick.\n4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a different location (car park) and a different cause of death (antifreeze poisoning) than what is stated in the article.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
