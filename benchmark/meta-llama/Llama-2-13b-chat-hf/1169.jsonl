Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that McKenzie has a record of eight wins and one draw from his nine fights. This suggests that he has been successful in his professional career so far.\n2. The article also mentions that McKenzie is the son of former British and European champion Clinton and is trained by his uncle, former three-time world champion Duke McKenzie. This implies that he has a strong boxing background and is being trained by experienced coaches.\n3. The summary states that McKenzie has become the first professional boxer to win a professional career. However, the article does not mention anything about McKenzie winning a professional championship or being the first to do so.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention McKenzie winning a professional championship or being the first to do so, while the summary states that he has become the first professional boxer to win a professional career. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
