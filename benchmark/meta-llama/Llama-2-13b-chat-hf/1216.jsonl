Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the new law in Bolivia sets harsher punishment for violence against children and sets a sentence of 30 years in jail for child homicide. This suggests that the law is aimed at protecting children from abuse and exploitation.\n2. The article also states that the law allows 12-year-olds to be contracted to work for others, but only with parental authorization. This suggests that the law is not a complete ban on child labor, but rather an attempt to regulate it and ensure that children are not being exploited.\n3. The article quotes Vice-President Alvaro Garcia Linera as saying that the new legislation reflects the needs of Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in South America. This suggests that the law is aimed at addressing the economic realities of the country and providing support for families who rely on their children for income.\n4. The article mentions that more than 500,000 children already work to supplement the family income in Bolivia, according to Unicef. This suggests that child labor is a significant issue in the country and that the law is intended to address this issue.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While the summary states that President Evo Morales has signed a law banning children from work, the article provides more context and details about the law, including the fact that it allows 12-year-olds to be contracted to work with parental authorization. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
