But six months later, the three-time Olympic gold medalist's office at the Misty May-Treanor Sports Center is empty after a mysterious fallout with her longtime trainer Mike Rangel, who founded the Irvine facility. Now parents are threatening to stop paying their  seasonal dues of $4,300 because their children aren't getting the benefit of May-Treanor's tutelage, as they feel they were promised. Scroll down for video . Olympic gold-medalist Misty May-Treanor has reportedly fallen out with longtime trainer Mike Rangel, just six months after he founded a new sports center in her name . Brand new: The 155,000-square-foot Misty May-Treanor Sports Center was opened in November 2014. Parents pay $4,300 to let their children play at the facility for a seven-month season . Boycotts: Some parents at the facility have threatened to stop paying their dues because May-Treanor has not been involved at the facility recently . In a new report by the OC Register, Rangel said he and May-Treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship. Rangel agreed to let Asics sponsor the club, while 37-year-old May-Treanor remains a spokesman for competitor Nike. 'I can respect the fact that she doesn\u2019t want to be photographed with 500 girls that are wearing Asics gear,' Rangel said. However, rumors abound in the club about a deeper-seeded issue that caused May-Treanor's distance, and the scrubbing of all her photos from the club's website. Cary Lambeth, a longtime youth basketball organizer who helped in the early planning stages of the MMTSC believes the break is 'because their visions were not the same'. 'I do not think Misty was doing it for Misty. I think Misty was doing it because she wanted to give back,' Lambeth said. Daily Mail Online reached out to May-Treanor's agent for comment on Tuesday, but did not immediately get a reply. Calls to Mike Rangel were also not returned. May-Treanor's apparent rift with Rangel is surprising considering their previously close relationship. In her 2010 autobiography, she described her relationship with Rangel as 'one of the most important partnerships' in her volleyball career. Rangel helped train May-Treanor between 2002 and 2012, during which she won three gold medals in the Olympics for beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. The split was also swift. May-Treanor attended coaches meetings for the new facility in August, and even gave excited interviews about the club in October. But since then it's been radio silence. Checked out: May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the MMTSC since October. The sports legend pictured on the left with a Laguna Hills High School senior at the facility on October 2 . Legend: It's still unclear what caused the rift between May-Treanor and her longtime trainer Rangel. Rangel trained May-Treanor for 12 years, during which she won three Olympic gold medals in beach volleyball with partner Kerri Walsh Jennings. May-Treanor pictured above compting in the London Olympic games . Erased: The club's website now shows now sign of Misty May-Treanor's name or image on the homepage . In October, May-Treanor told the OC Register that the building of the sports center was close to her heart, since she grew up in the area and knew there weren't many places for local kids to play. 'Growing up as a volleyball player around here, I know how gym space had become more and more limited,' May-Treanor said. 'This is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports, too. With the amount of sports and teams we have here, it\u2019s important to have a facility like this.' Brand minded? Rangel says the split with May-Treanor stems from a sponsorship issue. Asics is sponsoring the club, while May-Treanor remains a spokesman for Nike. May-Treanor and Jennings pictured above celebrating their gold medal win at the London games . She also appeared to be interested in interacting with the youth teams that trained at the center. 'I love the coaching and teaching aspect of what we\u2019ll be doing,' May-Treanor said. 'That\u2019s the big part for me, the sharing of information with younger players. And the beauty of this is that I don\u2019t have to be dedicated to one team.' May-Treanor hasn't been seen at the gym since October, a month before it's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office. Last month, about 60 parents with kids at the gym met in a nearby park to discuss action. And in a meeting with Rangel, volleyball mom Michelle Peters threatened to stop paying, saying she felt her 15-year-old daughter wasn't getting the advertised program (parents at the facility pay $4,300 for a seven-month season). 'What aren\u2019t you getting?' Rangel asked during the meeting. 'Well, we\u2019re not getting Misty May,' Peters responded. Rangel says most of the malcontent parents came from a club in Mission Viejo and were not happy when their former club director, who moved to work at the MMTSC, resigned over clashes with him. The 155,000-square-foot facility was pitched to May-Treanor by Rangel ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. Rangel wanted to built a state-of-the-art sports facility, while May-Treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair. The finished facility has 22 volleyball courts, 21 basketball courts - all with their own electric scoreboards. The facility also includes an air-conditioned 350-seat restaurant with 10 large HDTVs as an area to watch the games and practices.", "claim": "misty may-treanor has fallen out with longtime trainer
