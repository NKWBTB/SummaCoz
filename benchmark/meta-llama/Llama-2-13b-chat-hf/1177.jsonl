The article does not mention anything about indecent images of children. Instead, it states that Bayes has been charged with possessing an extreme pornographic image.\n3. The summary, on the other hand, states that Bayes has appeared in court charged with possessing indecent images of children.\n4. This is a significant difference between the summary and the article, as the article does not mention anything about indecent images of children.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, specifically the mention of indecent images of children."}
