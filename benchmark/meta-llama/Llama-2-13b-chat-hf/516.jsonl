The summary implies that Christopher Hogwood, the veteran classical music conductor, has died at the age of 83.\n2. However, the article states that Christopher Hogwood has indeed passed away, but it does not mention his age at the time of his death. The summary incorrectly specifies his age as 83.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which includes specific information about Christopher Hogwood's age at the time of his death that is not present in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure!

The summary does not mention anything about the funeral or memorial service.\n3. The article highlights Hogwood's extensive career as a conductor, including his founding of the Academy of Ancient Music and his work with many leading orchestras around the world. The summary does not mention any specific details about Hogwood's career or accomplishments.\n4. The article quotes several people who knew Hogwood, including his colleagues and friends, who describe him as a kind and generous person with an incredible capacity for absorbing information and a deep love for historically informed music.

The article provides specific details about Hogwood's career, accomplishments, and personal qualities, while the summary is very brief and lacks any of these details. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
