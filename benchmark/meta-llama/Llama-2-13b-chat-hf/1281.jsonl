Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Mr. Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time of the incident. The summary does not mention anything about Mr. Ruto or his family being present at the scene.\n2. The article mentions that specialist troops were deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building. The summary does not mention anything about specialist troops or an intruder being present.\n3. The article states that earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr. Ruto's home. The summary does not mention anything about gunmen or any other individuals being present at the scene.\n4. The article mentions that the wounded police officer was in a stable condition. The summary does not mention anything about the police officer's condition.\n5. The article places the incident 10 days before Kenya's upcoming elections. The summary does not mention anything about the timing of the incident or the upcoming elections.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that a Kenyan man was shot dead during an election rally in Nairobi, but the article provides much more detail about the incident, including the fact that Mr. Ruto and his family were not present, the presence of specialist troops, and the timing of the incident in relation to the upcoming elections. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
