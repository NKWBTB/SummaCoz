The article mentions that four masked assailants attacked the Yeni Safak building, but the summary does not mention this detail. Consistency issue: YES.\n3. The article states that the attacks happened early on Thursday, but the summary does not mention the day of the week. Consistency issue: YES.\n4. The article mentions that the windows in both buildings were shattered by gunfire and that numerous spent bullet casings were found at both scenes, but the summary does not mention this detail. Consistency issue: YES.\n5. The article states that the police are hunting the assailants, but the summary does not mention this detail. Consistency issue: YES.\n6. The article mentions that no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but the summary does not mention this detail. Consistency issue: YES.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions one office (Yeni Safak) and does not include other important details such as the number of assailants, the day of the week, and the police investigation. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
