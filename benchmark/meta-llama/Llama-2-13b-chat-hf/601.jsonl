The article states that the prosecution alleges that the optometrist, Honey Rose, failed to detect an eye condition in a boy named Vinnie, which led to his death.\n2. The article quotes the prosecution as saying that Ms. Rose's conduct was \"so far below the expected standard it was 'criminal'\".\n3.

Instead, it states that the prosecution alleges that Ms. Rose's conduct was criminal and that Vinnie's death was preventable.\n\nBased on the above, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not support the claim that the optometrist was cleared of manslaughter, and instead suggests that the prosecution alleges that the optometrist's conduct was criminal and that Vinnie's death was preventable. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
