Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the body of a man in his 70s was found at his home in Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, on Saturday afternoon. The summary does not mention the age of the victim.\n2. The article states that a man in his 80s was also taken to hospital. The summary does not mention this.\n3. The article mentions that detectives want to question 55-year-old Ian John McLoughlin in connection with the murder, and have warned people not to approach him. The summary does not mention Ian McLoughlin or any specific suspect.\n4. The article describes the victim's appearance and the clothing he was wearing. The summary does not mention any details about the victim's appearance or clothing.\n\nBased on these differences, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions a CCTV appeal, but the article provides much more information about the murder and the investigation, including the victim's age, the other person who was taken to hospital, the suspect, and the victim's appearance. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
