The summary does not mention anything about quitting road racing or Hondas.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions one specific event (the 2016 Isle of Man TT), while the article mentions multiple events and issues (the TT, mechanical problems, and the decision to quit road racing on Hondas). Additionally, the summary does not include any information about the Ulster Grand Prix or Martin McGuinness's decision to quit road racing. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
