Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the driver, Andreas Werner, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was fined \u00a31,000 and banned from driving in the UK for two years.\n2. The summary states that the motorist was jailed for eight years for causing the death of a motorcyclist in a crash on the A71 in North Wales.\n3. The article does not mention anything about the driver being jailed. Instead, it states that the driver pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was fined and banned from driving.\n4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the driver was jailed, while the article does not mention any jail sentence.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
