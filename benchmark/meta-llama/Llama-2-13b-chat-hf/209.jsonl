Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The summary mentions that Newcastle has made initial moves to sign Marseille forward Andre Ayew. The article also confirms this information.\n2. The summary states that Ayew is out of contract in the summer. The article also mentions this, stating that Ayew is out of contract at Marseille this summer.\n3. The summary mentions that Roma and Tottenham have asked to be kept informed about Ayew's situation. The article does not explicitly mention this, but it does state that several top sides, including Tottenham and Roma, are interested in Ayew.\n4. The summary states that Ayew has netted six times during the Africa Cup of Nations. The article does not mention this specific information, but it does state that Ayew scored three goals for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. While the summary accurately mentions some of the information in the article, it omits other important details and includes some inaccuracies. Specifically, the summary states that Ayew has netted six times during the Africa Cup of Nations, which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the article mentions that several top sides are interested in Ayew, but the summary only mentions Roma and Tottenham."}
