The article states that the investigators seized \"more than 5,300 bottles of alcohol\" and \"packets of a white powder called Sildenafil, better known as the anti-impotence drug Viagra.\"\n2. The summary only mentions \"a haul of alcohol\" being seized, without any mention of Viagra or any other substances.\n3. The article states that the powder was added to three different types of 'baijiu' - a strong, clear spirit that is the most popular drink in China.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about the type of alcohol that was seized.\n5. The article mentions that the haul was worth up to 700,000 yuan (\u00a372,000; $113,000).\n6. The summary does not mention any information about the value of the haul.\n7. The article mentions that the investigation is ongoing and that the two distillers are being investigated.\n8. The summary does not mention anything about the investigation or the distillers.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions \"a haul of alcohol\" being seized, without providing any details about the type of alcohol, the value of the haul, or the ongoing investigation. The article, on the other hand, provides specific details about the types of alcohol seized, the value of the haul, and the ongoing investigation. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
