Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions that Paul Merson was brought on with only seven minutes remaining in his team's 0-0 draw with Burnley. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Merson was critical of Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week, but does not mention Merson being brought on in the Burnley game.\n2. The summary states that Andros Townsend scored the equaliser for Tottenham in the 89th minute. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Townsend was brought on in the 83rd minute, not the 89th minute.\n3. The summary mentions that Paul Merson had another dig at Andros Townsend after his appearance. This is consistent with the article, as the article states that Merson had another dig at Townsend after Tottenham drew with Burnley.\n4. The summary states that the midfielder had been brought on to the England squad last week. This is not consistent with the article, as the article states that Townsend was brought on for England against Italy, not that he had been brought on to the squad last week.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
