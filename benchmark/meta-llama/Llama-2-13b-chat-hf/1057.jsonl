Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol. The summary does not mention these specific flights.\n2. The article states that the flights will allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home. The summary does not mention this detail.\n3. The article mentions that the flights are the latest addition from KLM since it started Inverness-Amsterdam flights last year. The summary does not mention this detail.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions new flights between Inverness and Amsterdam this summer, but the article provides additional details about the specific flights and their schedules. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
