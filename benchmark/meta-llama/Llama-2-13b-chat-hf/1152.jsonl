The article states that the project aims to plant \"millions\" of native UK trees, and that the Woodland Trust is inviting local people and visitors to plant trees in tribute to the estimated 40,000 people from the island of Ireland who lost their lives in the conflict.\n3. The article mentions that the project will result in 40,000 native trees being planted in Brackfield Wood, with carpets of wildflowers including iconic poppies.\n4. The article quotes the director of the Woodland Trust, Patrick Cregg, as saying that the project is a special opportunity for people to make a personal and hands-on contribution to Brackfield Wood, which is still in its infancy.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a \"huge tree\" being unveiled in Brackfield, County Londonderry, but there is no mention of a tree being unveiled in the article. Instead, the article focuses on the Woodland Trust's tree planting project and the aim of planting 40,000 native trees in Brackfield Wood to commemorate the people who died during WW1."}
