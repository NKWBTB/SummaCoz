The article states that the veteran, Charles Lewis, was awarded the Ushakov medal by the Russian embassy for his service in the Arctic Convoys during World War II.\n2. The article also mentions that the Foreign Office initially blocked the Russian embassy from awarding the medal to the veterans due to rules against receiving foreign medals more than five years after the act.\n3. However, the British government created the Arctic Star in 2012 to recognize the service of the Arctic Convoy veterans, and the Foreign Office later allowed an \"exception to the rules\" to allow the Russian embassy to award the Ushakov medal to the veterans.\n4. The article quotes Lewis as saying that he and his colleagues were simply doing their bit for the war effort and did not see themselves as heroes.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that a World War II veteran was awarded medals for Russian military veterans after a World War II aircraft, which is not accurate. The article actually discusses the awarding of the Ushakov medal to British veterans of the Arctic Convoys by the Russian embassy, and the British government's role in allowing this to happen."}
