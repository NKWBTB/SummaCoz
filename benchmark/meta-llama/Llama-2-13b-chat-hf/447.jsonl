However, the article does not mention a service of remembrance in New Zealand.

Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.\n2. The summary does not mention World War One or any specific battle. Instead, it only mentions the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.\n3. The article mentions that the service at Westminster Abbey was attended by King George V in 1916, a year after the Anzac landings at Gallipoli. This suggests that the Anzac landings took place before 1916.\n4. The summary does not mention any specific date or time frame for the Gallipoli landings.\n5. The article mentions that the service at the Cenotaph featured prayers read by schoolchildren and the national anthems of all three countries. The summary does not mention any details about the ceremony at the Cenotaph.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the 70th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, while the article provides more information about the history of Anzac Day and the service at Westminster Abbey. Therefore, the answer is no. The summary is not consistent with the article."}
