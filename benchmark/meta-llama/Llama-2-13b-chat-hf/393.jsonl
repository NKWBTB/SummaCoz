Here's how it's unfolding: . It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV . While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the \"blood moon.\" NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\"  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28. If you want to learn more about the eclipse, NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will take questions on Twitter @NASA_Marshall. Did you see the total lunar eclipse?

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the lunar eclipse started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.\n2. The summary only mentions the time the moon began moving into Earth's shadow, but does not provide any information about the duration of the eclipse or the fact that it will be visible only in certain parts of the world.\n3. The article provides detailed information about the timing and visibility of the eclipse, including the fact that the total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and that parts of South America, India, China, and Russia will also be able to see the eclipse.\n4. The summary does not mention any of this information, only stating that the moon began moving into Earth's shadow at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides much more detailed and specific information about the lunar eclipse, while the summary only mentions a single fact and does not provide any additional context or information. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
