Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Chechen Muslim clerics met on April 3 and adopted a resolution calling for \"retribution\" against those who insulted their faith and the dignity of Chechen men.\n2. The article also states that the resolution was interpreted as a call for \"reprisals against journalists\" who reported on the detention of over 100 people suspected of being homosexual in Chechnya.\n3. The article quotes the Chechen spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, as saying that \"there will be retribution!\" and that Allah will punish those who slandered the Chechen nation and clerics.\n4. The article mentions that Novaya Gazeta's report on April 1 included allegations that detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun.\n5. The article notes that Ramzan Kadyrov, the authoritarian leader of Chechnya, has denied the allegations and called them \"lies.\"\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions \"Russia's state TV agency\" and \"Chechen Chechnya,\" but there is no mention of these elements in the article. Additionally, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, which focuses on the resolution adopted by Chechen Muslim clerics and their call for retribution against journalists who reported on human rights abuses in Chechnya."}
