The article states that the collection is worth over \u00a3100,000, but the summary only mentions that the collection is worth more than \u00a3100,000 without specifying the exact amount.\n2. The article mentions that the collection includes works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters, and photographs, but the summary only mentions \"art\".\n3. The article states that the collection was at risk of being sold and scattered around the globe, but the summary does not mention this.\n4.

The article mentions that the Art Fund will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
