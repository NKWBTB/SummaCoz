Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Dawlish to Teignmouth line was closed for two months in 2014 due to storm damage, and that the line was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014.\n2. The article also states that a report published in the Journal of Transport Geography predicts that 10% of journeys on the line could be affected by 2040 due to sea level rises.\n3. The report also states that adverse weather disrupts the line about 10 days per year, but that this could rise to almost 40 by 2040 and up to 120 by 2100.\n4. The article quotes academics as saying that there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout the UK.\n5. The article states that Network Rail hopes to develop \"long-term interventions\" to \"secure the future\" of the line, and that the Department for Transport has invested \u00a331m into improving the resilience of the route.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary suggests that the main rail line between London and the south of England could be reopening to the public, but the article does not mention anything about the line reopening. Instead, the article focuses on the potential impact of sea level rises on the line and the need for long-term interventions to secure its future."}
