The summary states that the victim was a 19-year-old student.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the shooting occurred at a hostel attached to a private school in Bangalore, while the summary only mentions a school in Bangalore without specifying it was a private school. Consistency: Inconsistent.\n2. The article identifies the alleged gunman as Mahesh, who was working as an office assistant in the school, while the summary does not mention the name of the gunman. Consistency: Inconsistent.\n3. The article states that police say it is not clear what prompted the shooting, while the summary does not mention any information about the motive behind the shooting. Consistency: Inconsistent.\n4. The article mentions that two students were shot, with one of them, Gautami, dying from her injuries, while the summary only mentions one student being shot. Consistency: Inconsistent.\n5. The article states that the alleged gunman was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt, while the summary does not mention any information about the gunman's arrest. Consistency: Inconsistent.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important details such as the name of the gunman, the motive behind the shooting, and the fact that two students were shot, while including information that is not present in the article (such as the fact that the school is private). Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
