Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the power station will be built on the site of a former coal mine in East Yorkshire. The summary does not mention the location of the power station.\n2. The article mentions that the power station will be built next to the newly-constructed Ferrybridge Multifuel 1, which is a waste-to-energy plant. The summary does not mention any existing power stations or waste-to-energy plants in the area.\n3. The article states that the power station will produce electricity from refuse, industrial and commercial waste, including wood. The summary does not mention the type of fuel that the power station will use.\n4. The article mentions that the power station will create hundreds of jobs during the three-year build period and will produce electricity for about 160,000 homes. The summary does not mention any job creation or the amount of electricity that the power station will produce.\n5. The article states that the Secretary of State has granted development consent for the new plant. The summary does not mention any government approvals or permits.\n\nBased on these differences, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide enough information about the location, type of fuel, job creation, or government approvals that are mentioned in the article. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
