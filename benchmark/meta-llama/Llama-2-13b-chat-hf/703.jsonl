Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO).\n2. The article also mentions that many landlords are put off from applying for the licence because of the cost, which can be up to \u00a31,000.\n3. The article states that there are an estimated 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the Southampton area.\n4. The summary states that six residential homes in Southampton are facing eviction because of a shortage of council tenants.\n\nBased on the information above, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about eviction or a shortage of council tenants. Instead, it focuses on the requirement for landlords to obtain a licence for HMOs and the potential penalties for not doing so. The summary is not supported by the information in the article."}
