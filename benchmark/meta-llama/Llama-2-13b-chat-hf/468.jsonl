The summary implies that a waste processing plant in Greater Manchester has been suspended after a fire broke out at the site.\n2. However, the article mentions that Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, the company running the site, has been suspended from accepting waste by the Environment Agency (EA) due to reasons not directly related to the fire. The article does discuss the fire incident, but it does not directly attribute the suspension to the fire.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary that suggests the suspension is primarily a result of the fire, whereas the article clarifies that the suspension is related to waste management and environmental issues, which may or may not be connected to the fire incident.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure!

The article mentions that the fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport, and the environment. This information is not present in the summary.\n3. The article states that the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators after considering all the facts relating to the company and the site. This information is not present in the summary.\n4. The article mentions that the company is still required to remove all the waste, but the summary does not include this information.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the fire and the suspension of the company, but it does not provide any information about the reasons for the suspension or the concerns raised by the fire service. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
