{"document": "Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, said she drank body lotion because she was hungry and thirsty.\nShe was only brought out on Saturday morning after security forces found a teacher she knew to convince her it was safe to come out.\nMs Cheroitich said her ordeal began at around 05:30 (02:30 GMT) on Thursday when she and her fellow students were in class studying for their exams.\n\"Suddenly, we heard the bullets and then we started coming out and then we said: 'What is happening?'\" she told the Associated Press news agency.\n\"We ran to our rooms, then these people came running, following us. When we reached our rooms, we hide under the beds.\"\nShe said that their pursuers told them to come out of their hiding places, but she decided to hide in the wardrobe instead where she covered herself with some clothes.\nIt was then that the gunmen entered the room. Ms Cheroitich described a scenario that other survivors have alluded to.\nHer roommates were taken out and divided up between those who were able to recite verses of the Koran and those who were not.\nIt was not clear what happened to them.\nShe said she found some bottles of body lotion where she was hiding and \"drank all of them\", describing it as \"nice and lovely\".\nBut she was too scared to move. \"I was just praying to my God,\" she said.\nIt was not until 10:00 on Saturday, long after the attack ended, that the authorities were able to persuade her to come out.\nShe told AP: \"You know at first I did not believe it [when police came to rescue her], at first I was thinking that maybe they were the al-Shabab.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the woman, Cynthia Cheroitich, was hiding in a wardrobe during the attack. The summary does not mention anything about a wardrobe.\n2. The article states that the attackers separated the students into two groups based on their ability to recite verses of the Koran. The summary does not mention this detail.\n3. The article states that the woman drank body lotion during her hiding period. The summary does not mention this detail.\n4. The article states that the authorities were able to persuade the woman to come out of her hiding place on Saturday morning. The summary does not mention this detail.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important details and includes inaccurate information (such as the location of the attack being Chernobyl, which is not mentioned in the article). Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
