Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the theatre has been unused for decades, which suggests that it has been closed for a long time.\n2. The summary states that the theatre is to reopen its doors for the first time in more than 50 years. This implies that the theatre has been closed for at least 50 years.\n3. The article mentions that the theatre was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays, and all kinds of entertainment, including early cinema screenings. This suggests that the theatre was built as a multi-purpose performance venue.\n4. The summary does not mention any specific type of performances or events that will be held at the theatre, other than the statement that it will reopen its doors for the first time in more than 50 years.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. While the article provides detailed information about the theatre's history, purpose, and planned renovations, the summary only states that the theatre is to reopen its doors for the first time in more than 50 years, without providing any additional information about the types of performances or events that will be held there."}
