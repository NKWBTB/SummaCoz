Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Pearce, who was in charge of England Under-21s for six years and also took caretaker charge of the senior team following Fabio Capello's resignation, told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek: 'You only really know what it's like to manage when you're in that technical area and you're the manager. 'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both.

'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position.
