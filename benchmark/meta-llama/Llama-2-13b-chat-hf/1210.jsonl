Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the man fell from a cherry picker, but the summary states that a pick-up fell from a pick-up truck. These are two different types of vehicles, and it's unlikely that a pick-up truck would have a cherry picker on top of it. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article in this regard.\n2. The article states that the police are conducting a joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive, but the summary makes no mention of this. If the police are conducting an investigation, it's likely that they would be working with other agencies, such as the Health and Safety Executive, but the summary doesn't mention this. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article in this regard.\n3. The article states that the company is cooperating fully with the investigation, but the summary makes no mention of this. If the company is cooperating with the investigation, it's likely that this information would be included in the summary, but it's not mentioned. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article in this regard.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article."}
