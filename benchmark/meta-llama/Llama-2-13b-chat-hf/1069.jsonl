Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Michael Luciw's family is calling for regular driving tests for older drivers after he was killed in a car crash caused by a driver in his 70s.\n2. The family is quoted as saying that retired people should undergo regular driving tests to ensure their safety and the safety of others on the road.\n3. The article also mentions that Age UK supports the idea of regular driving tests for older drivers.\n4. However, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) does not plan to restrict licensing based on age, and states that evidence does not show that older drivers are more likely to cause serious accidents.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the family is \"looking forward\" to having their licence removed, which is not supported by the article. In fact, the article states that the family is calling for regular driving tests to ensure their safety and the safety of others on the road. Additionally, the article mentions that Age UK supports this idea, but the DVLA does not plan to restrict licensing based on age."}
