Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that there have been 69 incidents of threats to Jewish community centers in 27 states in the past month. The summary only mentions \"a number\" of centers being threatened, without specifying the exact number.\n2. The article mentions that all of the threats made on Monday, along with previous incidents in January, turned out to be false. The summary does not mention this detail.\n3. The article quotes White House press secretary Sean Spicer as saying that President Donald Trump has made it \"abundantly clear\" that such actions are \"unacceptable.\" The summary does not mention this quote or any response from the White House.\n4. The article mentions that former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has called for action to prevent further incidents. The summary does not mention this detail.\n5. The article states that the threats were made through calls that were both pre-recorded and live, with suspects using voice-disguising technology. The summary does not mention this detail.\n6. The article mentions that there have been reports of threats to centers in many states, including New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Delaware, Connecticut, Alabama, California, Maine, Tennessee, South Carolina, Missouri, Wisconsin, Texas, and Kansas. The summary only mentions \"a number\" of centers in the US.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief and incomplete overview of the article's content, omitting many important details and providing an inaccurate representation of the full story. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
