The dispute between the party\u2019s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019 The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co\u2019 at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics \u2013 as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party\u2019s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: \u2018Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. \u2018We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.\u2019 A Labour spokesman said last night: \u2018There is no truth in this allegation.\u2019", "claim": "lucy powell, 40, became embroiled in a dispute over ms powell's brit.", "cnndm_id": "10f08229ca491fd0111f427c6e9b9301bdbf2435", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["A petty feud between the two most powerful women in Ed Miliband\u2019s inner circle has rocked the Labour Party.", "The dispute between the party\u2019s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote.", "Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair \u2013 both rivals for Miliband\u2019s ear \u2013 to a head.", "Flare-up:", "Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56,", "became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans .", "It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell \u2013 who is tipped as a future Labour leader \u2013 to attend the Brits \u2018pre-party\u2019 where guests mingle with pop stars.", "But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs.", "One source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.\u2019", "The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the \u2018second jobs\u2019 debate was partly the responsibility of Labour\u2019s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her.", "In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote.", "But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London\u2019s O2 Arena.", "Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline.", "Commenting on the dispute, one source said: \u2018Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co\u2019 at the Brits .", "She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics \u2013 as tea girl in his office in 1980.", "Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party\u2019s ranks.", "Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November.", "A Labour MP said: \u2018Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics.", "\u2018We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.\u2019", "A Labour spokesman said last night: \u2018There is no truth in this allegation.\u2019"], "sum_sents": ["lucy powell, 40, became embroiled in a dispute over ms powell's brit."], "rel_index": [4, 5], "cot": "1.
