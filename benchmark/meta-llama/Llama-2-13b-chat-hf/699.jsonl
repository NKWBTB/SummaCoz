However, the article does not mention any such charge against a man for causing the death of a woman in Limavady, County Londonderry. The article discusses an incident at Joe's Bar in Dungiven, involving a sudden death, violations of liquor licensing hours, legal actions against individuals associated with the bar, and fines imposed on them. There is no mention of a man being charged with causing a woman's death in Limavady.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that paramedics were called to attend a sudden death at Joe's Bar in Dungiven at 06:00 BST on 6 October 2014.\n2. The article also states that police arrived a short time later and found several people still at the bar.\n3. The article mentions that till receipts showed alcohol was being served as late as 04:49 BST.\n4. The article states that the judge ordered the closure of the bar for three months.\n5. The article mentions that Colleen O'Neill, 43, was charged with two counts of allowing the consumption of liquor outside licensing hours, and James Thomas, 44, was charged with one count of the same charge.\n\nBased on these points, here's my conclusion:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a man being charged with drinking alcohol and causing the death of a woman in Limavady, County Londonderry, but the article does not mention any death or any charges related to drinking alcohol. The article only mentions charges related to allowing the consumption of liquor outside licensing hours."}
