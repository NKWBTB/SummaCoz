Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Giants got a short-handed opener through player-coach Derrick Walser, but Jeff Dimmen pulled the Panthers level. This information is not present in the summary.\n2. The article mentions that Mike Forney's powerplay breakaway goal made it 2-1, with Andy Bohmback equalizing. This information is not present in the summary.\n3. The article states that Mike Radja scored from an acute angle and James Desmarais made it 4-2 before Nottingham's David Ling got one back. This information is present in the summary, but it is not accurately stated as the summary only mentions a 4-2 win for the Giants.\n4. The article mentions that the teams will meet again on Saturday night in the second match of their double-header. This information is not present in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions a 4-2 win for the Giants, but the article provides more detailed information about the game, including the fact that the Giants did not win the title and that the teams will meet again in a double-header. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
