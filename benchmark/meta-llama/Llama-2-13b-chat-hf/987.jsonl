The summary mentions that Louis van Gaal scored in the 87th minute, five minutes after coming on as a substitute. This information is not present in the article, which only mentions that Curacao won 2-1 on Saturday in Willemstad.\n4. The article states that Curacao will face Cuba in the next round, on June 8 and 16. This information is not present in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. The summary omits information about Curacao's next opponent (Cuba) and includes an incorrect statement about Louis van Gaal scoring a goal. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
