Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that \"Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK.\" The summary does not mention anything about the EU, so this information is not supported.\n2. The article states that \"Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK.\" The summary does not mention anything about the type of criminals that the new measures are intended to prevent, so this information is not supported.\n3. The article states that \"Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade.\" The summary mentions that migrants must prove they have not committed a crime, but it does not mention anything about producing a certificate from the authorities. This information is not supported.\n4. The article states that \"Some 1.9million people arriving on visitor visas, or those from 56 countries and territories which do not need visas, will not need to provide their criminal histories because this would be \u2018disproportionate\u2019 in terms of time, cost and bureaucracy.\" The summary does not mention anything about visitor visas or the number of people who will be exempt from providing their criminal histories, so this information is not supported.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important details and does not accurately convey the information in the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
