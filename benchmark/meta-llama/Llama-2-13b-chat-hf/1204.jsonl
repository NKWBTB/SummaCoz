The article notes that there have been warnings that the Spanish government could start charging British expats for healthcare if the UK leaves the EU.\n4. The article quotes one expat, John Richardson, as saying \"Oh, they'll sort something out\" when asked about the potential financial implications of a Brexit.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions the EU's \"second black country\" being in the UK, which is not supported by the article. The article focuses on the experiences of British expats living in Spain and the potential financial implications of a Brexit for them, but it does not mention anything about the UK being the EU's \"second black country.\""}
