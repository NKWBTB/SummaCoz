The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that tens of thousands of people attended the annual Anzac Day parade in the Gallipoli landings in Hyde Park.\n2. However, the article does not mention an Anzac Day parade in the Gallipoli landings in Hyde Park. The article discusses Anzac Day services and events held in London, including a service at Hyde Park Corner, a parade, and the wreath-laying at the Cenotaph. These events commemorate the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which inaccurately describes the location and nature of the Anzac Day events mentioned in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Anzac Day commemoration took place at Hyde Park Corner and the Cenotaph, but the summary only mentions the Gallipoli landings in Hyde Park. This is inconsistent, as the article does not mention Gallipoli at all.\n2. The article states that the service was held at Westminster Abbey, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the article provides information about the location of the service that is not present in the summary.\n3. The article mentions that the national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the article provides information about the musical elements of the service that is not present in the summary.\n4. The article mentions that the service was attended by thousands of people, including veterans, service personnel, and their families, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the article provides information about the size and demographics of the crowd that is not present in the summary.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the Gallipoli landings, which is not mentioned in the article, and omits other important details such as the location of the service, the national anthems sung, and the attendance of the crowd. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
