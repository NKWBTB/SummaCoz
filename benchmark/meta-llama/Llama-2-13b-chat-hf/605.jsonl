However, the article does not mention that the man was jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl. The article discusses Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister.

The article states that the perpetrator, Clive Weatherhogg, was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity with a man that he found through an adult website.\n2. The article also states that Weatherhogg sent a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day.\n3. The article mentions that Weatherhogg was placed on the sex offenders register and that he will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh.\n4. The summary states that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee.\n\nBased on the information provided, here's my answer:\n\nNO, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about a 15-year-old girl being sexually abused, and instead focuses on Weatherhogg's actions towards an adult woman. The summary is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
