The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, the area being searched in Dublin, the involvement of the Irish police (Garda\u00ed), and the release of CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.\n3.

The article mentions that the search for Trevor Deely will involve excavations and is expected to take a number of weeks, while the summary does not mention any specific location or time frame for the investigation.\n4. The article mentions that detectives have released CCTV footage of a man they want to trace, while the summary does not mention any CCTV footage or appeal for the public to come forward.\n5. The article is set in Dublin, Ireland, while the summary is set in County Antrim.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide any information that is supported by the article, and instead presents a completely different location and set of circumstances.
