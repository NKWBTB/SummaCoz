It doesn't imply that the special education system itself is preventing the boy from going to school.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests that the special education system is the direct cause of the boy not being able to go to school, while the article specifies that it's the lack of available places in special schools that is the issue.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the boy is from Northern Ireland, but his family does not want him to be named to protect his identity.\n\nYes, the summary mentions that the boy is from county fermanagh, which is in Northern Ireland.\n\n2. The article states that the boy's parents made the difficult decision to remove him from mainstream schooling because he was not coping.\n\nYes, the summary mentions that the boy has not been able to go to school because of a special education system.\n\n3. The article states that the family requested a place for him at a special school but are still waiting.\n\nYes, the summary mentions that the family has not been able to find a special school for the boy.\n\n4. The article states that the family was told that all the special schools in the South Eastern Education Board area were full to capacity and no time frame could be given as to when a place would become available.\n\nYes, the summary mentions that the special schools in the area are full to capacity.\n\n5. The article states that the boy's mother is worried that this same situation will happen to other families as the special needs school system is packed to capacity.\n\nYes, the summary mentions that the family is worried about the lack of special school places for children with special needs.\n\n6. The article states that the Education Authority is \"currently reviewing the profile of need for special school places in Northern Ireland and is endeavouring to ensure that places are available close to where the children reside.\"\n\nNo, the summary does not mention this information.\n\nBased on the above, I would say that the summary is consistent with the article. All of the information in the summary is supported by the article, and the summary accurately conveys the main points of the article. Therefore, the answer is yes."}
