The article states that the EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and NGOs, as well as a higher education law that could lead to the closure of the Central European University (CEU).\n2. The article also mentions that Hungary's right-wing government is under pressure from European institutions to withdraw these laws.\n3. In response to this pressure, Hungary's president Michel Szijjarto has warned that Hungary could refrain from making attempts to withdraw the three laws.\n4. According to the article, Szijjarto said that \"Why should we? These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues.\"\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that Hungary's president warned that Hungary could refrain from withdrawing the laws, but the article provides more information about the reasons why the EU objects to these laws and the pressure Hungary's government is under to withdraw them. The summary leaves out important details about the EU's objections and the context of the situation."}
