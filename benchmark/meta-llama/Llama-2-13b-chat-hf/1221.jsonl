Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Rod Temperton died at the age of 66, while the summary states that he died at the age of 90. This is a clear inconsistency.\n2. The article mentions that Temperton was a songwriter and provides examples of some of his most famous songs, such as \"Rock With You\" and \"Thriller.\" The summary does not mention anything about Temperton's profession or his songs.\n3. The article states that Temperton was born in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, and that he traced his songwriting ability back to his father's influence. The summary does not mention anything about Temperton's birthplace or his father's influence.\n4. The article mentions that Temperton won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his work on Birdland, and that he was nominated for two Oscars in 1986 for his work with Quincy Jones on the soundtrack for The Color Purple. The summary does not mention anything about Temperton's awards or nominations.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
