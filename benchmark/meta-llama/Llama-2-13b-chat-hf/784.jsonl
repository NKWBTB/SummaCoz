{"document": "Jack Grealish wants to replace the Wembley misery he suffered as a fan with joy as a player when Aston Villa face Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Twice the teenage winger visited the national stadium to cheer on his boyhood club in 2010 but Villa lost both times, to Manchester United in the League Cup final and Chelsea in the FA Cup final four. Grealish, 19, was handed his first Premier League start by Tim Sherwood in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers and is hopeful of retaining his place for the April 19 date. Jack Grealish made his first Premier League start for Aston Villa against QPR on Tuesday night Grealish saw Villa lose twice at Wembley in 2010 - in the League Cup final and in the FA Cup semi-final \u2018I went twice to Wembley as a fan, the Man U game and Chelsea game five years ago,\u2019 said Grealish. \u2018Unfortunately we didn\u2019t win either of them, hopefully this time we can go and get a result. \u2018It would be brilliant to stay in the team for Wembley but at the end of the day the gaffer will pick who he thinks he will win. I go with the flow. \u2018To start for my boyhood club was a dream come true. I hope towards the end of the season I can play more of a part and help the team stay in the division.\u2019 Wayne Rooney scores for United as Villa were beaten 2-1 in the 2010 League Cup final at Wembley Frank Lampard finds the target during Villa's 3-0 defeat by Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final in 2010 Villa are three points above the drop zone but Grealish says manager Tim Sherwood has bred confidence throughout the squad. \u2018He\u2019s so positive around the place, gives everyone a boost which you can see in people\u2019s performances,\u2019 Grealish added. \u2018He\u2019s given me my first start in a crucial game which I\u2019m really grateful for.

The article does not mention anything about Jack Grealish being handed his first Premier League start in 2010.
