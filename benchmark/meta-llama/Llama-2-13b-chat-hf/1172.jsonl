The summary does not mention the month or date when Trevor Deely was last seen.\n3. The article mentions that a search is under way for Trevor Deely, and that it is expected to take a number of weeks.\n4. The summary does not mention any search or investigation.\n5. The article mentions that CCTV footage from the night Trevor Deely went missing was enhanced using specialist technology, and that detectives are appealing for a man seen in the footage to come forward.\n6. The summary does not mention any CCTV footage or investigation.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide any information about the specific details of Trevor Deely's disappearance, such as the date or location, and it does not mention any ongoing search or investigation. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
