However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.\n3.

The motion is expected to contain the same provisions as the proposals announced last month in England and Wales, which include posthumous pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences and the ability for living men to apply for pardons.\n3. The article quotes the minister as saying that the motion will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales and allow for equal treatment of gay and bisexual men.\n4. The article states that the motion will be brought forward for consideration by the assembly.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the proposal has been approved by the Northern Ireland assembly, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only states that the motion will be brought forward for consideration by the assembly, but does not mention approval. Additionally, the summary does not mention the specific provisions of the motion, such as posthumous pardons and the ability for living men to apply for pardons, which are mentioned in the article."}
