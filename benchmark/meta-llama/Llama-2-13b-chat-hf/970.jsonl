{"document": "Gregory van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain in the summer and instead reiterated his 'love' for the club.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The summary states that Gregory van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain in the summer.\n2. The article also states that Van der Wiel has denied these claims, quoting him as saying \"I am genuinely happy at PSG. I love the club, I love the city and I love my team-mates. Everything is perfect for me here.\"\n3. The summary mentions that Van der Wiel had a recent spat with his manager Laurent Blanc after being dropped from the team.\n4. The article also mentions this falling out, but notes that Van der Wiel has reiterated his love for the club and has no plans to leave.\n5. The summary states that the Parisians continue to be linked with a move for Barcelona star Dani Alves, which could potentially lead to Van der Wiel being sold.\n6. The article does not mention anything about Dani Alves or the possibility of Van der Wiel being sold.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While the summary accurately reports Van der Wiel's denial of plans to leave PSG, it omits other important details from the article, such as his love for the club and his desire to sign a new contract. Additionally, the summary mentions the possibility of Dani Alves joining PSG, which is not mentioned in the article.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article is: NO."}
