Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that \"Two cars were damaged in the incident in the Nursery Drive and Parkhead area of Newry on Friday night.\" The summary does not mention anything about the number of cars damaged.\n\nConsistency check: The article mentions two cars were damaged, but the summary only mentions one car. This is not consistent.\n\n2. The article quotes Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin as saying \"he was a 'appalled by mindless attacks on PSNI officers and the Newry community'\". The summary does not mention anything about the Assistant Chief Constable's statement.\n\nConsistency check: The article quotes a statement from the Assistant Chief Constable, but the summary does not mention this statement. This is not consistent.\n\n3. The article mentions that the PSNI Newry & Mourne Facebook page posted a message saying \"we would also appeal to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.\" The summary does not mention anything about the Facebook post.\n\nConsistency check: The article mentions a Facebook post from the PSNI Newry & Mourne page, but the summary does not mention this post. This is not consistent.\n\nBased on the above checks, the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
