A drinking competition went tragically wrong when a student died after downing 25 shots of vodka. Humberto Moura Fonseca, 23, had been partying at the university of Julio de Mesquita in the city of Bauru, in southwest Brazil, when organisers suggested the drinking game to see who could drink 25 shots in less than 60 seconds. His friend Rodrigo Pancetti, 23, said: 'We were all having a great time and someone came up with the idea of the drinking competition. 'I knew I'd already had too much and there was no way I was going to be able to drink five, let alone 25. But Humberto and the others were really up for it. 'On his Facebook there is a quote, a motto, from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky which says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom. I never thought that would become reality. 'But once he had finished he said he felt ill and suddenly collapsed. 'We assumed it was because he was drunk but then six others also collapsed, including the winner, so we called an ambulance.' Medical crews rushed the students to hospital but Mr Fonesca died on the way. A hospital spokesman said: 'They all had alcohol poisoning and are in a critical state, with three still in intensive care.' Now police say they are looking to charge the organisers with homicide. Ironic: A quote on\u00a0Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom' Drinking competition: Medical crews rushed the students to hospital but Mr Fonesca died on the way . A police spokesman said: 'Two fourth year students at the university have been arrested for organising the event without a licence and for potentially causing the death of the student.' A spokesman for the university said: 'We very much regret the death of this young man and our condolences go out to his family and friends.

The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom.But the truth in article is Humberto Moura Fonseca posted on facebook that 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Humberto Moura Fonseca, a 23-year-old student, died after attempting to drink 25 vodka shots in 60 seconds during a drinking competition at his university in Brazil.\n2. The article quotes a friend of Humberto's, Rodrigo Pancetti, as saying that Humberto and the other students were \"really up for\" the drinking competition and that they were all having a great time.\n3. The article also states that Humberto had a quote on his Facebook page that said \"it is better to die from vodka than from boredom.\"\n4. The article goes on to say that six other students also collapsed after drinking during the competition, and that medical crews rushed them to the hospital, where Humberto died on the way.\n5. The article concludes by stating that police are looking to charge the organizers of the event with homicide, and that the university has banned drinking on campus.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the quote on Humberto's Facebook page, but it does not mention the drinking competition or the tragic events that occurred as a result. The summary is too brief and does not provide enough information to be considered consistent with the article."}
