The article mentions that Roma and Everton have asked to be kept informed about Ayew's situation, but the summary does not include this information.\n3. The article states that Ayew has netted six times for Marseille this season, but the summary only mentions that he has netted six times without specifying the context.\n4. The article mentions that Ayew scored three goals for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations, but the summary does not include this information.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important details and does not accurately convey all of the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
