Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the boat capsized in the Durris area, at Craiglug. The summary does not mention the location of the capsizing.\n\nConsistency check: The summary does not provide information about the location of the capsizing, which is mentioned in the article.\n\n2. The article states that one of the three teenagers made it ashore, and efforts were being made to reach the other two who were stranded on an island in the river. The summary only mentions that three teenagers were rescued.\n\nConsistency check: The summary does not mention the fact that one of the teenagers made it ashore and that the other two were stranded on an island. This information is only provided in the article.\n\n3. The article states that the alert was raised shortly after 13:45. The summary does not mention the time when the alert was raised.\n\nConsistency check: The summary does not provide information about the time when the alert was raised, which is mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on the above checks, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief overview of the event, but it does not include all the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
