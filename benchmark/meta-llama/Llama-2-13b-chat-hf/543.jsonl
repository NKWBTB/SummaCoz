Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Colchester United \"failed to re-take the lead\" after a series of close calls, including a saved shot and a goalmouth scramble.\n2. The article also mentions that Blackpool goalkeeper Sam Slocombe made a \"sensational save\" to push the ball behind, and that Colchester United's Sean Murray was shown a straight red card for a bad tackle.\n3. Based on these details, it seems that the match was a close and intense one, with both teams creating scoring opportunities and the outcome uncertain until the end.\n4. The summary, on the other hand, simply states that Colchester's unbeaten run came to an end with a draw at Blackpool.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While the summary accurately states that Colchester's unbeaten run ended with a draw, it does not provide the same level of detail about the closely contested nature of the match and the key plays that took place. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
