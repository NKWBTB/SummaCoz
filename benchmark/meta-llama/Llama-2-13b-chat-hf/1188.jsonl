The summary only mentions a tweet, while the article provides more information about the allegation of online harassment and the fact that the tweets were not threatening. Additionally, the article mentions that the allegation was made by a woman in her 30s and that the harassment is said to have taken place over the past two years, which is not mentioned in the summary."}
