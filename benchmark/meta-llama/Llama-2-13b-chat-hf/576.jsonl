The article also states that Spurs have won just twice on the road since September, and have drawn at fellow top-six rivals Arsenal and Manchester City.\n3. Pochettino is quoted as saying that if Chelsea go 12 points clear, it will be a \"big problem\" for Spurs.\n4. The article suggests that Spurs have struggled against the top six teams away from home, winning only once in their past 17 meetings.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the article is discussing Pochettino's concerns about Spurs' ability to compete for the Premier League title, and the team's struggles against top-six opponents away from home.\n\nTherefore, the summary \"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino says Chelsea will be 'very difficult' to fight for a place in the Premier League next season\" is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention Chelsea or Pochettino's comments about Chelsea. Instead, it focuses on Pochettino's concerns about Spurs' performance and their struggles against top-six teams away from home.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
