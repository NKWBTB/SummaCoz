However, Joanne Parker made light of the incident writing: 'Haha funny...would love to have seen the police face.' The current temperatures in Algeria is 28C, and this has remained fairly constant over the last week or two. Temperatures are set to peak at 25C over the next three days in England, however the north will see slightly lower temperatures than the south.

The summary does not include the information about the police warning about wasting time, which is a key detail in the article."}
