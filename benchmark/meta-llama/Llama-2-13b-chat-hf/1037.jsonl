The article also mentions that Greece's resorts are teeming with tourists, which suggests that the country is not in a state of complete economic collapse, as one might expect if it were under the control of foreign powers.\n3. The article notes that the Greek people are not manning the barricades in protest against the announced austerity measures, which suggests that they are not being forced to accept these measures against their will.\n4. The article states that Tsipras remains remarkably popular despite conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal austerity, which suggests that he still has the support of the Greek people.\n5. The article notes that the continued partial closure of the banks in Greece means that many Greek companies have no money to lend, which will likely further impoverish the Greek people.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article.
