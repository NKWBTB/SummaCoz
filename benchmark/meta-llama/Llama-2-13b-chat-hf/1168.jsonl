Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Private Derby XXX was promoted to the rank of lance corporal at an event in Chester, but the summary does not mention anything about a parade or the Battle of the Somme.\n2. The article states that Private Derby XXX received his promotion for \"good behaviour\", but the summary does not mention any information about his behaviour or actions.\n3. The article mentions that Private Derby XXX is a mascot for the Mercian Regiment, but the summary does not mention anything about the regiment or any military context.\n4. The article provides specific details about Private Derby XXX's history and career, such as his acquisition in 1858 and his participation in events like switching on Christmas lights and meeting Prince William, but the summary does not include any of these details.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief and vague description of a World War I soldier participating in a parade, while the article provides a detailed account of a specific ram's promotion and history as a mascot for the Mercian Regiment. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
