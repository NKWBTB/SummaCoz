Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Bob Katter accused the Queensland Government of assuming that Billy Gordon would quit after he was accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history.\n2. Katter also stated that he believed the government thought they had a \"little black puppet on a string\" in reference to Gordon.\n3. The article notes that Katter's statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology.\n4. The summary states that Katter said he was a \"black puppet on a string\" and that the lefty loons stayed silent.\n\nNow, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary misrepresents Katter's statement by leaving out the context of his comments and the criticism they received. In the article, Katter's statement is described as \"bizarre\" and sparked criticism on social media, while the summary presents it as a straightforward statement without any negative connotations. Additionally, the summary misleadingly implies that Katter's comment was directed at the left, when in fact the article states that Katter was responding to the Queensland Government's assumption about Gordon's future. Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
