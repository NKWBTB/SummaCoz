Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the fight between Nicola Adams and Alberto Salazar will be over four three-minute rounds, rather than the usual two-minute rounds for women.\n2. The summary states that Nicola Adams lost her WBO super-bantamweight title to Alberto Salazar in the first round.\n3. If the fight was over four three-minute rounds, it is unlikely that Adams would have lost in the first round, as she would have had at least three more minutes to fight.\n4. The article quotes Adams as saying that the extra minute in each round will give her a chance to try out things she has learned in the gym. This suggests that Adams is confident in her abilities and expects to be able to perform well in the longer rounds.\n5. Therefore, it is unlikely that Adams would have lost in the first round, as she would have had more time to fight and would have been expected to perform well.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention Adams losing in the first round, and it suggests that she is confident in her abilities and expects to perform well in the longer rounds. Therefore, the summary is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer is: NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
