Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Shutter Speed won the Musidora Stakes at York, but the summary says that Shutter Speed won the Epsom Derby. This is inconsistent, as the Musidora Stakes is a different race from the Epsom Derby.\n2. The article mentions that Shutter Speed is a filly, but the summary does not mention this detail.\n3. The article states that Shutter Speed is trained by John Gosden, but the summary does not mention the trainer.\n4. The article mentions that Enable and Coronet are top contenders for the Epsom Oaks, but the summary does not mention this.\n5. The article states that Cracksman may not run in the Dante Stakes due to the ground conditions, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article.
