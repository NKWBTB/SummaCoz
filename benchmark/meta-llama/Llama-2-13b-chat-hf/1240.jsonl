Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that \"the victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury\" which implies that there was only one victim. However, the summary states \"three people have been treated in hospital\" which suggests that there were multiple victims.\n2. The article mentions \"three men\" who entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people, but the summary does not mention the number of attackers.\n3. The article states that one of the group set light to the woman's hair, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n4. The article mentions that officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack, but the summary does not mention any CCTV images or police investigation.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately convey the information in the article, and omits several key details. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
