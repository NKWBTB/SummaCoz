This is consistent with the article, which states that Curacao advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF under Kluivert's leadership.\n2. The summary mentions that the Caribbean island team won 4-3 on aggregate at Montserrat. This is consistent with the article, which states that Curacao won 2-1 on Saturday in Willemstad and drew 2-2 in the second-leg match at Montserrat.\n3. The summary states that the Holland team faced a 2-2 draw in a second-leg match at Montserrat. This is not consistent with the article, which does not mention anything about the Holland team.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about Patrick Kluivert's mother being from Curacao, which is mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While it accurately reports some of the key details, such as Curacao's advancement to the next round and Kluivert's leadership, it also contains some inaccuracies and omissions. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
