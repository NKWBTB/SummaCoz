The article states that Fawzi al-Odah, a Kuwaiti citizen, was released from Guantanamo Bay and boarded a Kuwaiti government plane to return home.\n3. The summary does not mention the name of the detainee, while the article specifically names Fawzi al-Odah.\n4. The summary does not mention the reason for the detainee's release, while the article states that the US review panel concluded that al-Odah was not a \"continuing significant threat\" and that his release was part of the US government's effort to reduce the number of detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\n5. The summary does not mention the fact that al-Odah had been at the US facility since 2002 or that he had challenged the US government's right to detain him in the US Supreme Court.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides only the most basic information about the release of a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, while the article provides much more detailed information about the specific detainee who was released, the reasons for his release, and the circumstances of his detention. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
