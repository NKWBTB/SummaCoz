Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the victim was fatally injured outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, close to the city centre. The summary does not mention the location of the shooting.\n2. The article mentions that the victim was either in or close to a black Mercedes car when he was shot. The summary does not mention the car.\n3. The article states that the victim was taken to Northern General hospital but died from his injuries. The summary does not mention the victim's fate.\n4. The article mentions that there have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, including one on Monday in the Shiregreen area and another earlier this month in the Southey Green area. The summary does not mention any other shootings.\n\nBased on these differences, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the most basic information about the shooting (the victim's age and the location of the shooting), while the article provides more detailed information about the victim's condition, the car he was in, and other recent shootings in the area. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
