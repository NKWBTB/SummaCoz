The summary implies that Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister, He Szijjarto, called on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws.\n2. However, the article does not mention He Szijjarto making such a statement or calling on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws. The article discusses Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and its objections to specific EU objections, such as tight controls on asylum seekers, regulations on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and a higher education law.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister, Zsolt Szijjarto, has said that the EU should not interfere with \"domestic issues.\"\n2. The article also states that the EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and NGOs, as well as a higher education law that could lead to the closure of the Central European University (CEU).\n3. The article quotes Szijjarto as saying that \"these laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues.\"\n4. The article also states that Poland has backed Hungary's stance on the issue, with Szijjarto saying that his Polish colleague had made it clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister has called on the European Commission to block EU laws, but the article does not support this claim. Instead, the article states that Szijjarto has called on the EU to refrain from interfering with Hungary's domestic issues. The article does not mention any calls for the European Commission to block EU laws."}
