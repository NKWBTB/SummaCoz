The gadget which slightly resembles a guitar\u2019s fret board, connects to a smartphone, tablet or computer, to allow a user to play any instrument, style and sound on it. Scroll down for video . \u2018Instrument 1\u2019 (pictured centre) claims to be one electronic device that lets you \u2018be the whole band\u2019 because it can be used as a variety of instruments, including a guitar, violin, bass, piano and drum machine . It can be used with hundreds of musical apps, such as GarageBand because it recognises universal gestures, such as strumming, tapping, bowing and sliding, for example. Because if its just rectangular in shape, the instrument, which measures  23.5 inches (60cm) long, can be played in a number of ways. For example, it can be held under the chin like a violin or laid flat on a table like a piano. Artiphon, the Nashville Tennessee-based team behind Instrument 1, say the device is designed for musicians and complete amateurs, because it is intuitive to use. \u2018We believe anyone can make music, and that most people really want to,\u2019 the start-up wrote on its Kickstarter page. The gadget connects to a smartphone, tablet or computer, to allow a user to play any instrument, style and sound on it.\u00a0Because if its non-descript shape, the instrument can be played in a number of ways. For example, under the chin like a violin (top left) or laid flat on a table like a piano (bottom left) \u2018We\u2019re building an instrument that empowers people to play music apps beyond the touchscreen, and we want to inspire people to explore music-making in their everyday lives.\u2019 The company is creating an app to people can customise Instrument 1. They will be able to make new instrument presets and play them straight away, or use a bow on a banjo and pluck a drum. There are plans to create a version for the Apple Watch and allow an iPhone to be used as a bow, for example. The app is being developed for Apple devices. It has digital strings that stand in for a guitar\u2019s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys. The sound of notes can be changed by using guitar techniques on the fingerboard or by strumming on the bridge, as well as pressing hard and softly. \u2018If you\u2019re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine,\u2019 the firm said. \u2018And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.\u2019 The device enables musicians to re-tune it instantly and turn frets on and off, allowing people to slide between notes seamlessly and use vibrato to make the sound \u2018quiver\u2019 - a technique used by professional violinists. Instrument 1 (pictured) has digital strings that stand in for a guitar\u2019s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys. It measures 23.5 inches (60cm) long . Because the machine is a simply retangular shape and can be used as any instrument, users can play the instrument in different ways. People can hold it under their chins like a violin, or place it on a table like a keyboard, for example. 'If you want to play like a guitar, you can chord and strum in familiar ways,' the start-up's Kickstarter page says. 'In a piano preset, put it on your lap and the frets become \u201ckeys\u201d like a piano (with up to six stacked octaves at your fingertips!). 'If you\u2019re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine. 'And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.' They can even assign different instrument sounds to different strings, to play several instruments at once. The firm is working on an app that lets people use an iPhone like a bow as well as an app for the Apple Watch. \u2018We\u2019ve designed the Instrument 1 to adapt to the way you want to play, and it scales in complexity based on your style and skills.\u2019 The company\u2019s aim is to create a customisable and \u2018effortless\u2019 instrument that can be used by anyone. \u2018Tune it all to E-major if you like, adjust the sensitivity, or forget strumming altogether and let it auto-play the notes you press,\u2019 it said. \u2018The Instrument 1 grows with you as you explore new styles of playing. \u2018You can increase complexity as you go, allowing for greater control over every aspect of your performance with its feather-touch playing surface. It's always in tune, and you'll never break a string!\u2019 The instrument is Midi-compatible \u2013 the standard used by most digital music programmes - and works with hundreds of apps (an example is shown) and software such as ProTools and Logic . To go off piste, the instrument can be plugged into a tablet or computer so it can make any sound imaginable, such as synthesiser noises.

While the summary mentions that \"Instrument 1\" is an electronic device that can be used as a variety of instruments, it does not provide the same level of detail as the article, which highlights the device's unique features and capabilities. Additionally, the summary does not mention the device's ability to connect to a smartphone, tablet, or computer, which is a key feature of the device according to the article."}
