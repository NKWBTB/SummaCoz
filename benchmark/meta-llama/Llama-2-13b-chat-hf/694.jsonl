The summary implies that fracking drilling has been confirmed in Lancashire by the British Geological Survey (BGS) following a major quake in April.\n2. However, the article discusses the suspension of shale gas drilling (known as \"fracking\") in Lancashire due to a 1.5 magnitude tremor, not a \"major quake.\" The article mentions the BGS's involvement in monitoring fracking-induced tremors but does not confirm fracking drilling as the cause of a \"major quake\" in April.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly characterizes the seismic event as a \"major quake\" linked to fracking drilling, whereas the article describes a smaller tremor and its impact on fracking operations.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure!

The article states that Cuadrilla, the company behind the fracking operations, has suspended drilling as a precaution after a 1.5 magnitude tremor was detected.\n2. The British Geological Survey (BGS) has confirmed that the tremor was caused by fracking drilling.\n3. The BGS has also stated that the tremor was centered on Poulton-le-Fylde, which is near the drilling site.\n4. The article quotes Dr. Brian Baptie, the head of seismology at the BGS, as saying that the earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-le-Fylde and that the data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).\n5. The article states that the BGS is monitoring fracking as a precaution and that there have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that fracking drilling has been confirmed in Lancashire, but the article does not confirm this. Instead, it states that drilling has been suspended as a precaution after a tremor was detected and that the BGS has confirmed that the tremor was caused by fracking drilling. The article does not provide any information about the confirmation of fracking drilling in Lancashire."}
