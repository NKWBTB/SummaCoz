Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article is about a shooting incident in Sheffield, England, while the summary is about a shooting incident in North Belfast.\n2. The article mentions that the victim was found with a gunshot wound to his chest, while the summary mentions that the victim was shot in the head.\n3. The article states that the victim was taken to Northern General Hospital and died from his injuries, while the summary does not mention the victim's current condition or the hospital they were taken to.\n4. The article mentions that there have been several shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, while the summary does not mention any other shootings or locations.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary is describing a shooting incident in North Belfast, while the article is describing a shooting incident in Sheffield. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
