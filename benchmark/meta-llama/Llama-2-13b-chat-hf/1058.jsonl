Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Hatfield Colliery, located near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, has closed with the loss of 430 jobs.\n2. The article mentions that the mine has been run by the Hatfield Employee Benefit Trust since 2013.\n3. The article quotes John Grogan, the chairman of the trust, as saying that the mine's closure marks the end of an era and the end of coal mining in South Yorkshire.\n4. The article states that there were 50,000 miners in South Yorkshire in 1980, but now there will be none after the closure of Hatfield Colliery.\n5. The article mentions that the Mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones, accepted a piece of coal as a symbol of respect for all the miners who have gone before them.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the last deep coal mine in South Yorkshire, but the article discusses the closure of Hatfield Colliery, which is not specifically described as the last deep coal mine in South Yorkshire. Additionally, the summary does not mention the closure of the mine or the loss of jobs, which are key points in the article."}
