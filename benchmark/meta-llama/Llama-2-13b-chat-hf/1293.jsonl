However, the article does not mention a \"Thomas Thomas\" nor Thomas quitting football.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Thomas Hitzlsperger has come out as gay, which is a significant and courageous step, according to many figures in German football.\n2. The article quotes several prominent footballers and officials who have praised Hitzlsperger's announcement and expressed support for him.\n3. The article notes that Hitzlsperger's announcement is seen as a watershed moment in Germany, where homophobia has been a problem in football.\n4. The article states that Hitzlsperger's decision to come out is seen as a positive step towards greater openness about sexuality in German football.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the article is consistent with the summary. The summary mentions nothing about Hitzlsperger coming out as gay or the reaction to his announcement, while the article provides detailed information on these topics. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nThe answer is NO. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
