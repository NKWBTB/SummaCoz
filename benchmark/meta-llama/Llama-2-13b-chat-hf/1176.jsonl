The article also mentions that Chernova won the gold medal at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, South Korea.\n3. The summary states that Jessica Ennis-Hill will not compete at the world athletics championships because she faces a doping ban.\n\nBased on the information in the article, here's my reasoning:\n\nThe summary mentions Jessica Ennis-Hill, but there is no mention of her facing a doping ban or not competing at the world athletics championships. In fact, the article states that Chernova, not Ennis-Hill, was given a doping ban and had her results annulled. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nSo, the answer is no. The summary is not consistent with the article."}
