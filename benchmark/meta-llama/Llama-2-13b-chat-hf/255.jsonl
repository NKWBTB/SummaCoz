The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she said. But in the article, it is a fact that judge ordered her to stay away from her child and she didn't say it. The summary incorrectly concatenate sentences together.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The summary states that Monique Miller appeared in North Miami Beach, Florida. This is consistent with the article, which states that she appeared before a judge on Tuesday in North Miami Beach.\n2. The summary states that the judge ordered Miller to stay away from her child. This is consistent with the article, which states that the judge ordered Miller to stay away from her baby.\n3. The summary states that Miller was also ordered to take all of her prescribed medications. This is consistent with the article, which states that Miller was ordered to take all of her prescribed medications.\n4. The summary states that Miller told the judge that she needs a break from parenting. This is not consistent with the article, which does not mention Miller making any statement about needing a break from parenting.\n5. The summary states that cops allegedly tried to pull Miller over Monday afternoon during a routine traffic stop. This is not consistent with the article, which states that cops tried to pull Miller over on Monday afternoon during a routine traffic stop, but does not specify the day of the week.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. The summary leaves out some information from the article, such as the fact that Miller kicked the cop's car door and the fact that the baby was thrown out of the car window. Additionally, the summary includes some information that is not present in the article, such as Miller's statement about needing a break from parenting. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
