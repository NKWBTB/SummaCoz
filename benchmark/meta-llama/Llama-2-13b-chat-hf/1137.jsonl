Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the crash occurred on the southbound carriageway near the Hindhead tunnel at Bramshott, while the summary states that the crash occurred in central London. This is inconsistent, as Bramshott is not located in central London.\n2. The article states that the crash involved several vehicles, while the summary only mentions one car. This is inconsistent, as the article suggests that there were multiple vehicles involved in the crash, while the summary only mentions one.\n3. The article states that the 32-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene, while the summary does not mention any information about the victim's status. This is inconsistent, as the article provides information about the victim's fate, while the summary does not.\n4. The article states that a 33-year-old man from Waterlooville was arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention, while the summary does not mention any information about the suspect or their alleged actions. This is inconsistent, as the article provides information about the suspect and their alleged actions, while the summary does not.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides incomplete and inaccurate information about the crash, and omits important details that are included in the article. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
