The article mentions that Sylvia Blackburn, the victim, suffered serious head injuries but does not mention her death or the death of a six-year-old girl.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the defendant, Brian Wright, is accused of causing serious injury to Sylvia Blackburn, a 72-year-old lollipop lady, by dangerous driving.\n2. The summary states that the defendant has been jailed for six years for causing the death of a six-year-old girl.\n3. There is no mention of a six-year-old girl in the article. The article only mentions Sylvia Blackburn, who is 72 years old.\n4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions a six-year-old girl, while the article only mentions a 72-year-old woman.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
