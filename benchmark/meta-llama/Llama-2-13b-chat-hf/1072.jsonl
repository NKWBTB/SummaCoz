Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article discusses the current state of the economy in Longford, Ireland, and how it has been affected by the economic crash.\n2. The article mentions that local traders are seeing a turnaround in business, with one trader reporting an increase in sales over the past year.\n3. The article also mentions that the government has announced a 200m euro tourism development in the county, which is expected to bring 1,000 jobs to the area.\n4. However, the article notes that more needs to be done to boost local business, such as providing free parking in the town center.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the word \"Longford\" and does not provide any information about the town's economy or the government's plans for the area. The article, on the other hand, provides specific information about the town's economy and the government's investment in the area. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
