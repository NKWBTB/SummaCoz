{"document": "Tim Sherwood has urged Aston Villa to man up as he labelled their clash with relegation rivals QPR the club's 'biggest game' for years. They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown.

'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here. 'Listen, I know I am biased - he has been good for me and I have been good for him. But he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen.'

The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that Aston Villa hosts Rangers at the bottom of the Premier League on Tuesday.\n2. However, the article discusses a crucial match between Aston Villa and QPR, with Tim Sherwood emphasizing the importance of this game for Villa's Premier League survival. It doesn't mention Rangers, and there is no indication that the match will take place at the bottom of the Premier League. The summary incorrectly introduces the term \"bottom of the Premier League\" and mentions Rangers, which is not part of the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces information not present in the article, including the mention of Rangers and the phrase \"bottom of the Premier League.\" The article primarily focuses on the significance of the match for Aston Villa in the context of the Premier League relegation battle.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Aston Villa will host QPR on Tuesday, with the game being described as the club's \"biggest game for years.\"\n2. The article quotes Tim Sherwood as saying that this is the biggest game of his managerial career and that he needs to instill a different mentality into his players.\n3. The article states that Sherwood believes his team lacks the experience and mentality to grind out results, and that he has identified few players who can cope with the pressure.\n4. The article mentions that Sherwood and QPR manager Chris Ramsey are friends and former Tottenham assistants, and that Sherwood has hinted that he would consider bringing Ramsey to Villa Park if he were to leave QPR.\n\nBased on these points, here's my conclusion:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the game being played on Tuesday and the fact that Aston Villa will return to the bottom three with a better goal difference if they lose, but it does not include any of the other details mentioned in the article, such as Tim Sherwood's comments about the game being the biggest of his career, the team's lack of experience and mentality, or the friendship between Sherwood and Ramsey."}
