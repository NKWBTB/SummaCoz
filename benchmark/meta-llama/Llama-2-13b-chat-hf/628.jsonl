The summary states that a Russian investigation is underway into the downing of a Russian warplane by Turkey on Saturday.\n2. However, the article does not mention that the downing of the Russian warplane occurred on Saturday, and it doesn't provide a specific date for the incident. The article mentions that the Su-24 jet was shot down on November 24, but it doesn't confirm whether that was a Saturday.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the \"black box\" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday in front of journalists and diplomats. This suggests that the investigation into the downing of the jet is ongoing.\n2. The summary does not mention any information about the investigation being under way. Instead, it simply states that a Russian warplane was downed by Turkey on Saturday.\n3. The article provides details about the investigation, including the fact that flight information appears to be missing and that an analysis is expected to be released next week. The summary does not mention any of these details.\n4. The article also provides context about the crisis between Russia and Turkey over the downing of the jet, including the imposition of sanctions by Russia and the ongoing war of words between the two countries. The summary does not mention any of this context.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides only a brief and vague statement about the downing of the Russian warplane, while the article provides much more detailed information about the investigation and the ongoing crisis between Russia and Turkey. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
