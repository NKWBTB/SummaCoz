Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Nicholas Winton oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK.\n2. The article states that Winton worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees.\n3. The article mentions that Winton's self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge.\n4. The article provides details about Winton's early life, including his birth in London in 1909, his Jewish parents' conversion to Christianity, and his education.\n5. The article describes Winton's efforts to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories, including his trip to Prague in 1938 and his work with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport.\n6. The article mentions that Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home, and that he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport.\n7. The article states that Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes, and that he was knighted in 2003 in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the article provides a detailed account of Nicholas Winton's heroic efforts to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories during World War II.\n\nTherefore, the summary provided does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary only mentions Winton's death and does not provide any information about his heroic efforts or achievements.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
