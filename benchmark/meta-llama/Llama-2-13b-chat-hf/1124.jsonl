The article states that Guiseley \"have not lost in nine National League matches\" which suggests that they have a strong unbeaten record so far in the season.\n2. The summary states that Guiseley \"continued their 100% start to the national league season with a victory\". This statement is inconsistent with the article, as the article does not mention a victory for Guiseley. Instead, it reports that the match ended in a draw.\n3. The article mentions that Guiseley went ahead on 15 minutes against the run of play, but Gateshead later equalized in the second half. This suggests that the match was a close contest with both teams having chances to score.\n4. The summary does not mention any specific details about the match, other than the fact that Guiseley won. This is inconsistent with the article, which provides detailed information about the match, including the score, the goalscorers, and the yellow cards given to players.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary makes a statement that is not supported by the information in the article, and it does not provide any specific details about the match. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
