The summary states that the two main political parties in the Republic of Ireland are to vote on whether to take control of water charges. 2. However, the article states that water charges are one of the main sticking points to reaching agreement. In the article, there is no mention of voting to take control of water charges.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Fianna F\u00e1il wants to see the immediate removal of water charges, while Fine Gael sees a role for them.\n2. The summary does not mention anything about water charges or the parties' positions on them.\n3. Therefore, the summary does not provide any information that is supported by the article.\n\nBased on these points, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article. The summary does not include any information that is supported by the article, so it is not consistent with the article."}
