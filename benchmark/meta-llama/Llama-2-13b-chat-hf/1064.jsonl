Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that MacDonald signed for Torquay in 2014, but the summary says he signed for the club on a three-year deal. This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a three-year deal in the article.\n2. The article mentions that MacDonald played for Reading and Wimbledon, but the summary does not include this information. This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not provide all the information about MacDonald's previous clubs.\n3. The article quotes the head coach Paul Heckingbottom as saying \"Our squad is young and hungry, and Angus fits that mould perfectly.\" The summary does not include this quote, which suggests that it is not consistent with the article.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important information about MacDonald's previous clubs and does not provide the full quote from the head coach. Therefore, I answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
