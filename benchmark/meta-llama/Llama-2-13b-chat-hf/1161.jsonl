The summary only mentions that the company behind the tidal lagoon is \"disappointed\" that it received calls from the Welsh government for misleading data, but it does not provide any information about the specific figures or the disagreement between NRW and TLP. The article provides much more detail about the disagreement and the evidence that NRW has received. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
