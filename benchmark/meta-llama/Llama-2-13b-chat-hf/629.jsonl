Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Su-24 jet was shot down by F-16 fighters on November 24th, while the summary states that a Russian jet was shot down in the Syrian capital, Ankara. This is a contradiction, as Ankara is not a location in Syria.\n2. The article explains that both crew members ejected from the Su-24, but the pilot was killed by militants on the ground, while the navigator was rescued. The summary does not mention anything about the crew members or their fate.\n3. The article states that Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey, including a ban on package holidays, in response to the downing of the Su-24. The summary does not mention any sanctions or retaliation by Russia.\n\nBased on these contradictions, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
