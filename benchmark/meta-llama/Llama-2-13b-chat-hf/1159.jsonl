The summary does not mention anything about the other men who were kidnapped with Mr. Gustafsson.\n3. The article states that Mr. Gustafsson was freed in a dawn raid in Mali, but the summary does not mention the location of his release.\n4. The article quotes the Swedish Foreign Minister, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, as saying that Mr. Gustafsson was \"in good spirits\" and that he was \"happy\" and \"overwhelmed\" by the events of Monday. The summary does not include any quotes from the Swedish Foreign Minister.\n5. The article mentions that Mr. Gustafsson was kidnapped along with two other men, one of whom was freed in a dawn raid in 2015. The summary does not mention the other men who were kidnapped with Mr. Gustafsson.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide all the information that is included in the article, and it does not accurately convey the details of Mr. Gustafsson's release. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
