The summary implies that Newport RFC Chairman Gavin Foxall is stating that the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be the subject of a takeover bid.\n2. However, the article states that Gavin Foxall is discussing Newport RFC's lease at Rodney Parade and the potential impact of the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons. There is no mention of a takeover bid in the article.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has made a takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, which is a rugby team that shares the Rodney Parade stadium with Newport County, a football club.\n2. The article also mentions that Newport County has a lease to use the stadium until 2023 and has primacy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League.\n3. The WRU has signaled its intention to install an artificial surface, which is against Football League rules.\n4. Newport County chairman Gavin Foxall is quoted as saying that the WRU's takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday, May 9.\n5. Foxall also states that the WRU has been made aware of the fact that both County and Newport Squash Club, who are also based at Rodney Parade, are protected under their current agreements.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the WRU's takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, but the article provides more information about the situation, including the fact that Newport County has a lease to use the stadium until 2023, the WRU's intention to install an artificial surface, and the fact that the takeover bid will be put to a vote. Additionally, the summary does not mention the fact that both County and Newport Squash Club are protected under their current agreements."}
