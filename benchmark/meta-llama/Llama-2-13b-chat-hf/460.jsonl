However, the article does not mention the cancellation of a maritime attraction or a public inquiry related to it. The article discusses issues with a new chain ferry, breakdowns, grounding, and problems with the ferry's operation, but it doesn't mention the cancellation of a maritime attraction due to a lack of funds.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the council has ordered a review of the project by auditors, which suggests that there are issues with the new ferry.\n2. The article states that the ferry has broken down, run aground, and been suspended due to \"training issues\". This implies that the ferry is not functioning properly and has caused disruptions to traffic.\n3. The article quotes a shopkeeper who is concerned about the impact of the ferry's problems on her business, and a councillor who mentions that local businesses are bearing the brunt of the loss of almost six months of trade. This suggests that the ferry's issues are having a negative impact on the local economy.\n4. The summary states that a maritime attraction has been cancelled due to a lack of funds. However, the article does not mention anything about a maritime attraction being cancelled.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article discusses the problems with the new ferry and their impact on the local economy, but does not mention anything about a maritime attraction being cancelled. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
