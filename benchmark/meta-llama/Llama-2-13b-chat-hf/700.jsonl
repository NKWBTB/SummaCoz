The summary implies that thousands of unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton due to a shortage of landlords.\n2. However, the article does not support the idea that unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes.

It mentions concerns of tenants, but it doesn't state that landlords are being forced to live in their own properties.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that landlords who let properties to more than three unrelated people need to apply for a licence for a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO).\n2. The article also mentions that many landlords are put off from applying for the licence because of the cost, which can be up to \u00a31,000.\n3. However, the article notes that the fine for not having a licence can be up to \u00a320,000.\n4. The article states that there are an estimated 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the Southampton area.\n5. The article quotes a Shelter helpline adviser as saying that tenants in HMOs are often concerned about fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that \"thousands of unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton because of a shortage of landlords,\" which is not supported by the article. The article does mention a shortage of affordable homes, but it does not mention any shortage of landlords. Additionally, the article focuses on the need for landlords to obtain a licence for their HMOs, rather than the number of landlords in the area."}
