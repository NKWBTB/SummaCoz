The summary mentions that the site of a former power station in the Solent is set to be turned into a former oil chimney site.\n2. However, the article discusses the redevelopment of the disused Fawley power station, with plans to preserve its chimney as part of a larger development project. It does not suggest that the site is being turned into a former oil chimney site but rather into a mixed-use development.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary inaccurately suggesting that the site is being transformed into a former oil chimney site, while the article provides details about the redevelopment of the power station for a broader purpose, including the preservation of its chimney.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Fawley power station closed in 2013 after more than 40 years in operation.\n2. The summary does not mention the power station closing, and instead refers to it as a \"former\" power station. This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not acknowledge the power station's closure.\n3. The article mentions that the site was sold to developers in 2016, and that the developers plan to turn the site into a \"merchant city\" with a marina, housing, and restaurants.\n4. The summary does not mention any of these details, and instead simply refers to the site as a \"former oil chimney site.\" This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately describe the plans for the site.\n\nTherefore, based on these points, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately describe the plans for the former power station site, and does not acknowledge the power station's closure."}
