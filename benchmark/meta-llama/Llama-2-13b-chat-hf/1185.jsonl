Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the council is planning to relocate the Central Library to the Dolphin Centre, but the summary does not mention anything about relocation or moving the library.\n2. The article mentions that the council is cutting back on the Citizens Advice Bureau, but the summary does not mention anything about this.\n3. The article states that the council is working with traders to find a private buyer for the Victorian indoor market, but the summary does not mention anything about this either.\n4. The article quotes the council leader, Councillor Bill Dixon, as saying that tough choices have been made and that local people had the opportunity to comment during a public consultation. The summary does not mention anything about public consultation or the council leader's comments.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions one aspect of the article (the relocation of the Central Library), but leaves out many other important details that are included in the article. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
