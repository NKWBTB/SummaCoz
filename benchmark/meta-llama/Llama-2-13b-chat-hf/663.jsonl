The summary implies that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will be charged over the Hillsborough disaster, and this announcement has been made by the CPS.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication.

It does not state that the CPS itself will be charged; instead, the CPS is responsible for considering charges against individuals in connection with the disaster.\n3.

The summary states that the CPS will be charged, but the article does not mention any charges being brought against the CPS.
