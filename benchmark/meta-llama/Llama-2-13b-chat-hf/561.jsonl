The summary states that the government has confirmed that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men. Instead, the article discusses the intention to pardon gay and bisexual men who were convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, in line with England and Wales' plans for automatic pardons under 'Turing's Law.' The article mentions the process of presenting a motion in the assembly for approval, securing executive agreement, and the aim of equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland.\n3.

The article states that the motion going before the assembly will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, where plans for automatic pardons were announced last month.\n2. The article mentions that the law will allow for posthumous pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, as well as for living gay and bisexual men to apply for pardons.\n3.

The article states that the government has confirmed that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.\n\nBased on the information in the article, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men being pardoned, while the article mentions posthumous pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, as well as living gay and bisexual men being able to apply for pardons. The article does not specifically mention only gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men being pardoned."}
