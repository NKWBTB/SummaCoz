The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal and, if so, decide if it should be \"allowed or dismissed\".\n3.

The article mentions that the celebrity has \"occasional sexual encounters\" with another person, and that the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story.\n5. The judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction because the details of the allegations were now \"so widespread\" that confidentiality had \"probably been lost\".\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the celebrity wants to publish details of an alleged sexual relationship, but the article does not mention anything about the celebrity wanting to publish the information. Instead, the article focuses on the legal battle between the celebrity and the media outlet over the publication of the allegations."}
