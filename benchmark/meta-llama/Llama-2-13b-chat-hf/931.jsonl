Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Falcao struggled to hit the heights he achieved before suffering a serious knee injury while playing for Manchester United.\n2. The article also states that Falcao was not happy in France and Dirar believes that Falcao would have been better off staying at Monaco.\n3. The summary states that Dirar believes the Premier League is not the best for Falcao and that Falcao needs to work harder to be more consistent.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. While the summary mentions that Dirar believes Falcao needs to work harder and be more consistent, the article does not provide any information about Falcao needing to work harder or be more consistent. Instead, the article focuses on Falcao's struggles at Manchester United and Dirar's belief that Falcao would have been better off staying at Monaco. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article."}
