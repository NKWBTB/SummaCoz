There is no mention of any women's team or any women's tournament in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article is about James Milner, a male player, and his achievements with the England national team, while the summary is about Sam Allardyce, a female coach, and her new deal with an England Women's Super League One club. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
