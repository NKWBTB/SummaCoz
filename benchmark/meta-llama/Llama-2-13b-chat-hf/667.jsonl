The summary implies that the prison secretary has stated that inmates at a prison in Essex have been left \"notorious\" because of a \"breakdown.\"\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison and the concerns of residents and former inmates. It mentions a former inmate's claim about the use of drones for smuggling but does not mention a statement from the prison secretary about inmates being \"notorious\" due to a \"breakdown.\"\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Chelmsford Prison has been experiencing \"numerous incidents\" of packages being thrown over the wall, and that the prison is \"notorious\" for being \"flooded\" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis.\n2. The article quotes a former inmate who claims that drones are being used to fly contraband goods \"straight up to prison windows\".\n3. The Ministry of Justice acknowledges that there have been incidents of contraband being thrown over the wall, but denies the use of drones at the Chelmsford site.\n4. The Ministry of Justice also states that laws have been introduced to punish those who smuggle packages over prison walls with up to two years in jail.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that inmates at the prison have been left \"notorious\" due to a \"breakdown\", but the article does not mention any breakdown or suggest that the inmates are responsible for the contraband being thrown over the wall. Instead, the article focuses on the issues of contraband being thrown over the wall and the Ministry of Justice's efforts to address the problem."}
