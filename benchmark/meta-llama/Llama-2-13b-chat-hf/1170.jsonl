The summary states that the man was found guilty of assaulting his mother, but the article does not mention anything about the man's mother being assaulted.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Jamie Mitchell pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight. The summary does not mention anything about Jamie Mitchell pleading guilty.\n2. The article states that the pair (Jamie Mitchell and his mother Samantha) had initially told police that Mr. Dickie had pushed Mrs. Mitchell and she had pushed him back. The summary does not mention this detail.\n3. The article states that the pair had attempted to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events. The summary does not mention this detail either.\n4. The article states that the court heard the pair had initially told police that Mr. Dickie had pushed Mrs. Mitchell and she had pushed him back, but later Mr. Mitchell told police that he had tried to push the couple apart, causing a \"tragic accident\". The summary only mentions that Jamie Mitchell was found guilty of assaulting his mother, without mentioning any details about the events leading up to the assault.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the most basic information (Jamie Mitchell was found guilty of assaulting his mother), while the article provides more details about the events leading up to the assault and the pair's attempts to cover up their actions. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
