The summary states that Tansey has signed a new two-year contract with the league two side, keeping him at the club until June 2019, but the article does not mention this.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not include all of the information mentioned in the article, and it includes information that is not present in the article (i.e. the two-year contract).
