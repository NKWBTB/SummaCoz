However, the article is about the death of Barry Pring, who was killed by a speeding car while trying to hail a taxi in Kiev, and the subsequent inquest that concluded he was unlawfully killed. There is no mention of Barry Pring being shot in the head by his wife, and the article's content is entirely unrelated to this description.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Barry Pring was killed by a speeding car in 2008, while his wife Ganna Ziuzina was nowhere to be found.\n2. The inquest into his death was held in 2018, and the coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.\n3. The article mentions that Ganna Ziuzina was 19 years younger than her husband and that she tried to claim his assets shortly after his death.\n4. The family of the deceased believes that Ganna was involved in his murder, as she had a history of dishonesty and had tried to inherit his assets.\n5. The article states that the Ukrainian police had closed an inquiry into Barry's death but later relaunched it as a murder inquiry.\n\nBased on these points, here is my conclusion:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions that the man was shot in the head by his wife, which is not supported by the article. The article states that Barry was killed by a speeding car, not shot by his wife. Additionally, the summary does not mention the other details mentioned in the article, such as the inquest's verdict of unlawful killing, Ganna's attempts to claim Barry's assets, or the ongoing murder investigation in Ukraine."}
