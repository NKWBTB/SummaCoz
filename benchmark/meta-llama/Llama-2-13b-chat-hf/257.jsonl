Martin Freeman, one of Britain\u2019s most bankable Hollywood stars, was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity backer of Labour\u2019s 2015 general election campaign. The millionaire actor, who has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the Hobbit trilogy, was the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insisted Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019. Millionaire actor Martin Freeman (pictured) is the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insists Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019 But last night, the Labour leader faced embarrassment after it emerged that Freeman is a former supporter of Arthur Scargill\u2019s far-left socialist party which openly refused to vote Labour at the 2005 general election. Freeman himself also faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he sends his son to a \u00a312,000-a-year private school. Not only that, but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill \u2013 despite Freeman having an estimated fortune of \u00a310million. In last night\u2019s three-minute broadcast, Freeman, who found fame in the satirical British sitcom The Office, said: \u2018I don\u2019t know about you, but my values are about community, compassion, decency; that\u2019s how I was brought up.\u2019 Freeman with his partner Amanda Abbington (pictured) who declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill, despite living with Freeman, who is worth more than \u00a310million . In an address straight to the camera, the 43-year-old, who also stars in Sherlock, claimed the Tories would take the country on a \u2018rollercoaster of cuts\u2019 while Labour would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few, like me\u2019. The actor also insisted the Tories \u2018don\u2019t believe in the NHS\u2019 and added: \u2018For me, there\u2019s only one choice \u2013 and I choose Labour.\u2019 At first glance, it appeared to represent a much needed boost for Mr Miliband as Freeman is a good deal more famous than some of Labour\u2019s other celebrity backers \u2013 such as Baldrick actor Tony Robinson. But last night it emerged that Mr Freeman spent years supporting a far-left Socialist Labour Party that was set up by the militant miners\u2019 union boss Arthur Scargill in protest at New Labour. In an interview with the Guardian ahead of the 2005 election, Freeman declared that he voted for the party in 2001 and would not back Tony Blair. Asked how he would vote that year, he replied: \u2018Not Labour\u2019. The Socialist Labour Party, which is now almost defunct, campaigns for the \u2018abolition of capitalism\u2019 and the nationalisation of virtually every industry. Freeman faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported he sends his son to a private school . The Conservatives said Freeman\u2019s decision to switch his support to Labour showed how far Mr Miliband had dragged the party to the Left. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: \u2018Even Bilbo Baggins has recognised how far Labour has lurched to the left, imagine the chaos Red Ed would cause across Britain and the Shire.\u2019 Labour was also facing potential embarrassment over revelations about Freeman\u2019s personal life. Despite his socialist outlook, Freeman is reported to send his son to a school which charges up to \u00a312,669 a year. A spokesman for the actor was asked to comment, but did not respond. It was a major coup for Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured) but he faces embarrassment after it emerged Freeman is a former Scargill supporter . The star also hit the headlines two years ago after it emerged his long-term partner Amanda Abbington had declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill, despite living with Freeman, who is worth more than \u00a310million. Miss Abbington, who also appears in Sherlock, had been with Freeman for 11 years at the time. The couple have two children. The revelations sparked an outpouring of bad publicity for the couple, prompting Miss Abbington to settle her debts. She told the Radio Times later in 2013: \u2018It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s being sorted out. It was a big mistake and I\u2019m sorting it out right now. \u2018It\u2019s being paid off now. I would never want to go through this again. But I\u2019m paying it off.\u2019 Freeman\u2019s decision to back Labour appeared to win the enthusiastic backing of Miss Abbington, who posted a message on Twitter saying: \u2018F*** the Tories.\u2019 Labour said the party election broadcast had received \u2018unprecedented\u2019 interest on the internet, with hundreds of thousands of people choosing to watch. The actor appears in front of a plain white background and, despite encouraging voters to put Labour in power, makes no mention of Mr Miliband or the prospect of him becoming the next prime minister. Instead, he focuses on contrasting Labour\u2019s \u2018values\u2019 with those of the Tories, who he claims \u2018have got sod all to offer the young\u2019. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: \u2018Labour is trying to whitewash Ed Miliband from their campaign \u2013 his MPs don\u2019t want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast doesn\u2019t even mention him.'", "claim": "martin freeman, one of britain's most bankable hollywood stars, was last night. the millionaire actor was the focus of a glossy three-minute film. he sends his son to a # 12,000-a-year private school. but he declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid # 120,000 tax bill. freeman is a former supporter of arthur scargill's far-left socialist party.", "cnndm_id": "c38b56215719718f3402197e3401cbfcc9d01be1", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["It seemed like a major coup for Ed Miliband.", "Martin Freeman, one of Britain\u2019s most bankable Hollywood stars, was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity backer of Labour\u2019s 2015 general election campaign.", "The millionaire actor, who has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the Hobbit trilogy, was the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insisted Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019.", "Millionaire actor Martin Freeman (pictured) is the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insists Mr Miliband\u2019s party would \u2018make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few\u2019", "But last night, the Labour leader faced embarrassment after it emerged that Freeman is a former supporter of Arthur Scargill\u2019s far-left socialist party which openly refused to vote Labour at the 2005 general election.", "Freeman himself also faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he sends his son to a \u00a312,000-a-year private school.", "Not only that, but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid \u00a3120,000 tax bill \u2013 despite Freeman having an estimated fortune of \u00a310million.", "In last night\u2019s three-minute broadcast, Freeman, who found fame in the satirical British sitcom The Office, said: \u2018I don\u2019t know about you, but my values are about community, compassion, decency;

Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
