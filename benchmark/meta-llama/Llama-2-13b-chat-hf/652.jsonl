The summary states that a horse died after being hit by a horse in Cheltenham, as per what a trainer has said.\n2. However, the article reports that the horse, named Many Clouds, collapsed and died after narrowly beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. There is no mention in the article of the horse being \"hit by a horse.\" The horse's death is attributed to a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that the horse died from being hit by another horse, whereas the article provides a different cause of death, a severe pulmonary haemorrhage, which is unrelated to being hit by another horse.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the horse, Many Clouds, collapsed and died after winning a race at Cheltenham.\n2. The article attributes the cause of death to a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage,\" which is a rare condition that can occur in horses without any underlying health issues.\n3. The article mentions that Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, but had never collapsed before.\n4. The trainer, Oliver Sherwood, is quoted as saying that the horse was the \"horse of a lifetime\" and that he had no significant underlying health issues.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the horse died after being hit by another horse, but the article does not mention any such incident. Instead, it attributes the horse's death to a rare pulmonary haemorrhage. Additionally, the summary does not mention the horse's previous symptoms of post-race ataxia or the fact that the trainer stated there were no significant underlying health issues. Overall, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content."}
