The summary implies that the article is about police in the Republic of Ireland searching for a man who has been missing for more than 20 years.\n2.

The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, including the area being searched, the involvement of the police (Garda\u00ed), and the efforts to identify a man seen in CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Trevor Deely was last seen walking home from a Christmas party in December 2000.\n2. The summary does not mention the month or season when Trevor Deely went missing. It only states that he has been missing for more than 20 years.\n3. The article mentions that the search for Trevor Deely is taking place in Dublin, specifically in the Woodlands beside the R112, and that it is expected to take a number of weeks.\n4. The summary does not mention the location of the search or the duration of the search.\n5. The article mentions that detectives have been conducting a complete review of Trevor Deely's disappearance, including enhancing CCTV footage from the night he went missing.\n6. The summary does not mention any details about the investigation or the use of technology to enhance CCTV footage.\n\nBased on these differences, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide all the information that is mentioned in the article, and it does not accurately convey the details of Trevor Deely's disappearance and the ongoing search for him. Therefore, the answer is no. The summary is not consistent with the article."}
