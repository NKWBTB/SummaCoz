Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Fosse Park is located near junction 21 of the M1, but the summary does not mention this location.\n2. The article states that the new owners have met with the council to discuss \"potential planning questions\", but the summary does not mention this.\n3. The article mentions that the new owners plan to improve parking and traffic congestion, but the summary does not mention this.\n4. The article quotes the leader of Blaby District Council, Ernie White, but the summary does not include any quotes.\n5. The article mentions that the new owners want to address \"the quality of what we call the common areas\" and improve facilities, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that the owners are planning a \"better view\", but the article provides much more information about the new owners' plans and the council's involvement. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
