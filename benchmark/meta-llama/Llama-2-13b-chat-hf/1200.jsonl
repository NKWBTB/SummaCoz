Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that an inquest into the death of a man who was struck by a train at a Somerset hospital found that a number of mental health patients died.\n2. The article goes on to say that the inquest heard that the man who died, David Knight, was being treated at Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset, because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.\n3. The article also states that the jury concluded that the man's death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from the hospital.\n4. The article mentions that the Department of Health has accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care \"must be eliminated by 2020/21\".\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that an inquest found that a number of mental health patients died, but it does not provide any information about the specific circumstances of the man's death or the jury's findings. The article provides much more detail about the man's death and the jury's conclusions, as well as information about the Department of Health's response to the situation. Therefore, the summary is not a complete or accurate representation of the article's content."}
