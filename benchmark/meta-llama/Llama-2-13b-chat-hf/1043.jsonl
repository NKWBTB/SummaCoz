Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Morata joined Juventus in 2014, so he was not a Real Madrid player at the time.\n2. The summary states that Real Madrid have signed Morata on a four-year deal, which is not consistent with the article's information that he already joined Juventus in 2014.\n3. The article mentions that Morata's move to Juventus included an option for Real to buy him back, but the summary does not mention this detail.\n4. The article states that Morata has scored three times for Spain in Euro 2016, but the summary does not mention this information.\n5. The article mentions that Morata has won two Serie A titles and two Coppa Italias with Juventus, but the summary does not mention these achievements.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary incorrectly states that Morata is joining Real Madrid when, in fact, he has already been playing for Juventus for two years. Additionally, the summary does not include several key details mentioned in the article, such as the option for Real to buy him back and his achievements with Juventus. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
