The summary does not mention the closure of the power station.\n3. The article describes the planned glass tower as being the centrepiece of the development, and mentions that it will be the tallest attraction south of London's Shard. The summary does not mention the glass tower or its height.\n4. The article mentions that the development will include fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth.
