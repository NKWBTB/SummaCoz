The summary implies that a cat has been found dead after a \"massive\" chemical spill in a street in Leicestershire.\n2. However, the article does not mention a \"massive\" chemical spill in a street in Leicestershire. The article reports that several cats near Victor Avenue in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, have ingested a toxic substance, which has led to their deaths.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that \"tests confirmed all of the cats near Victor Avenue, in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, had ingested the toxic substance.\" This information is not present in the summary.\n2. The summary mentions a \"massive\" chemical spill, but the article does not use this word. Instead, it states that the cats had ingested a toxic substance, which could be any type of chemical or pesticide.\n3. The summary mentions only one cat that has died, while the article states that three other cats in the area have died in the last seven days, and another cat died two weeks ago.\n4. The summary does not mention the RSPCA's appeal for people to ensure pesticides and chemicals were stored safely, which is a significant detail in the article.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not include all of the information present in the article, and it contains some inaccuracies (such as the use of the word \"massive\" to describe the chemical spill). Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
