Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the device found in Sheffield is believed to be a World War Two munition.\n2. The summary only mentions a \"World War Two bomb\" without specifying that it is believed to be a munition.\n3. The article states that the device was found in a street in Sheffield, but the summary does not provide a specific location.\n4. The article mentions that this is the fourth time in a week that a device has been found in the city, but the summary does not mention this.\n5. The article states that the area was declared safe by South Yorkshire Police after a bomb disposal team was called in, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief and incomplete summary of the article's content, omitting important details such as the location and the fact that this is the fourth time a device has been found in the city. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
