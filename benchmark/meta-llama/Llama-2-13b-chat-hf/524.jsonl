The summary implies that Newport County director of rugby Steve Foxall expects to sign a new contract at Rodney Parade.\n2. However, the article states that Newport County has a lease to use the ground, and it mentions the uncertainty regarding the Welsh Rugby Union's (WRU) takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons and potential changes to the stadium.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests that Steve Foxall's expectation of signing a new contract is the main focus, while the article discusses the broader context of stadium usage and potential changes due to the WRU takeover.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Newport County have a lease to use Rodney Parade until 2023, and that they have primacy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League.\n2. The article also mentions that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has made a takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, who share the stadium with Newport County.\n3. The WRU has signaled their intention to install an artificial surface, which is against Football League rules.\n4. Newport County director of rugby Steve Foxall is quoted as saying that he expects to sign a new contract at Rodney Parade.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article mentions that Newport County have a lease to use Rodney Parade until 2023 and that the WRU has made a takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, but it does not mention anything about Steve Foxall signing a new contract. The summary is missing important information and is not an accurate representation of the article."}
