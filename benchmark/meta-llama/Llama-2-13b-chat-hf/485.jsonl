The article does not mention a BBC investigation or that older people are to be given more care based on the investigation.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Sarah Rochira, is conducting a review into the quality of life and care of older people in residential care in Wales.\n2. The review aims to gather evidence from older people, their families, and care providers to develop recommendations for improving the quality of care.\n3. The article quotes the commissioner as saying that she wants to hear about the experiences of older people living in residential care and highlight both good and poor care.\n4. The commissioner is also reviewing factors such as physical and psychological health, social relationships, and the care home environment to determine the quality of life for older people in care homes.\n5. The article mentions that the commissioner has received an increasing amount of correspondence about the quality of care for older people in Wales and has spoken publicly about unacceptable variations across the country.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions \"more care\" for older people in care homes, which is not a accurate representation of the article's content. The article discusses a review into the quality of life and care for older people in residential care, and the commissioner's efforts to gather evidence and develop recommendations for improving the quality of care. The summary does not capture the full scope of the article's content."}
