However, the article does not mention that Afghanistan beat Ireland by 46 runs in a one-day twenty20 international in Nagpur. Instead, the article provides details of a T20 cricket match between Ireland and Afghanistan that took place in Greater Noida, where Afghanistan won by six wickets. The article also mentions that these sides were meeting again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday.\n3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the error that implies the match was a one-day T20 international in Nagpur, while the article states that the match was a T20 cricket match in Greater Noida.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the match was a T20 international, while the summary states that it was an ODI. This is a clear inconsistency, as T20s and ODIs are two different formats of cricket.\n2. The article mentions that Ireland made 165-5, while the summary states that Afghanistan beat Ireland by 46 runs. This is also an inconsistency, as if Ireland had made 165-5, they would have won the match, not lost by 46 runs.\n3. The article mentions that Afghanistan made 171-4, while the summary does not mention the Afghanistan score. This is another inconsistency, as the summary should have included the Afghanistan score if it was a comprehensive summary of the match.\n4. The article mentions that the match was played in Greater Noida, while the summary does not mention the location of the match. This is a minor inconsistency, but it should still be included in the summary.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and it contains several errors and omissions. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
