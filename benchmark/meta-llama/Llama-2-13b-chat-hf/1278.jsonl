Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Rosie O'Donnell \"fell ill at home\" and \"looked up her symptoms online\" before taking aspirin. The summary does not mention anything about falling ill or looking up symptoms online.\n2. The article mentions that O'Donnell searched \"women's heart attack symptoms\" online and found that her symptoms matched those of a heart attack. The summary does not mention this detail.\n3. The article states that O'Donnell visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99% blocked. The summary does not mention this detail.\n4. The article mentions that O'Donnell's heart attack was a \"widow maker\" type of attack. The summary does not mention this detail.\n5. The article states that O'Donnell did not call the emergency services, but she issued a warning to her readers to \"know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911.\" The summary does not mention this detail.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that Rosie O'Donnell had a heart attack, but it does not provide any details about her symptoms, her search for symptoms online, her visit to the cardiologist, or her warning to her readers. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
