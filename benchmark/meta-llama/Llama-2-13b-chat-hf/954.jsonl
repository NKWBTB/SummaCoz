{"document": "There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity\u00a0in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action. \u00a0Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans. The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the\u00a0Keepmoat Stadium .", "claim": "yorkshire side beat doncaster rovers at doncaster rovers on saturday . fleetwood tested the patience of the most fan fan . doncaster 's media team faced with sticking up the match highlights of the game highlights of 0-0 draw at doncaster .", "label": 0, "model_name": "M11", "cnndm_id": "dm-test-998cb27197db1fd299aff3322ac041ba4bf1148f", "cut": "val", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "summeval", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "error", "doc_sents": ["There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers.", "An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity\u00a0in League One.", "Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller.", "Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan .", "Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw .", "And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium.", "It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel.", "So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.", "\u00a0Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle.", "A must-see video for all football fans.", "The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the\u00a0Keepmoat Stadium ."], "sum_sents": ["yorkshire side beat doncaster rovers at doncaster rovers on saturday .", "fleetwood tested the patience of the most fan fan .", "doncaster 's media team faced with sticking up the match highlights of the game highlights of 0-0 draw at doncaster ."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10], "cot": "1.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Doncaster Rovers played a goalless draw against Fleetwood Town.\n2. The summary states that Doncaster Rovers were beaten by Fleetwood Town on Saturday.\n\nThis is the first inconsistency I noticed. If Doncaster Rovers were beaten, then they cannot have played a goalless draw.\n\n1. The article states that the match was a goalless draw, and that the two sides played out a 0-0 draw at the Keepmoat Stadium.\n2. The summary does not mention the score of the match at all.\n\nThis is the second inconsistency I noticed. If the summary does not mention the score of the match, then it is not consistent with the article, which explicitly states that the match was a goalless draw.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains inaccuracies and omissions that are not present in the article. Therefore, I answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
