Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Conor McGregor has unveiled a new tiger tattoo on his stomach.\n2. The summary does not mention the tiger tattoo.\n3. The article states that McGregor has claimed that his opponent, Jose Aldo, lacks the same motivation as him to win the title.\n4. The summary does not mention this claim.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions McGregor's tattoos and does not include any information about his motivation or his upcoming fight against Aldo. The article, on the other hand, provides more details about McGregor's preparation for the fight and his motivation to win the title.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
