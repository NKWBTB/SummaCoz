{"document": "Roy Oliver, 37, fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs in April, killing Jordan Edwards, 15.\nHis lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.\nThe policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.\nThe death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.\nOfficers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.\nPolice had initially said the vehicle reversed \"aggressively\" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.\nHe was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.\n\"It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office,\" Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.\nThe teenager was described by his coach as \"a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend\".\nRoy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.\nIf convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail.\nLee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: \"We remain cautious.

The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that the policeman was charged with the murder of a Dallas teenager, but the article never mentions the origin of the teenager victim.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Roy Oliver fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party, killing Jordan Edwards, 15. The summary does not mention the name of the victim or the fact that the shooting occurred as the car was driving away.\n2. The article mentions that the police had initially claimed that the vehicle reversed \"aggressively\" towards the officer, but footage discredited this claim. The summary does not mention this detail.\n3. The article states that Roy Oliver was charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers who were in the car. The summary does not mention these charges.\n4. The article quotes the Dallas County DA, Faith Johnson, as saying that \"justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly\" in the case. The summary does not include this quote.\n5. The article mentions that Roy Oliver faces 5 to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, and that he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973 if convicted. The summary does not mention these details.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not include many important details that are present in the article, such as the name of the victim, the initial claims by the police, the charges against Roy Oliver, and the potential consequences if he is convicted. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
