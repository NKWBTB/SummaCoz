Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Myles Keating has joined Torquay United on loan from Barrow until January.\n2. The summary does not mention the loan period, only stating that Myles Keating has joined Torquay United.\n3. The article also mentions that Ruairi Keating has joined Torquay United on loan from Barrow until January, but the summary does not mention Ruairi Keating at all.\n4. The article states that Myles Keating is a centre-back, but the summary does not mention his position.\n5. The article mentions that the transfer is subject to international clearance, but the summary does not mention this detail.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions Myles Keating and does not include the information about Ruairi Keating, the loan period, or Myles Keating's position. Additionally, the summary does not mention the requirement for international clearance. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
