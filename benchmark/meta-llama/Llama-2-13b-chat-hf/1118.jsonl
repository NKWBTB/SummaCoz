The article also mentions that Google, the owner of YouTube, has denied claims that the authorities can filter content.\n3. The article quotes a Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official as saying that all internet service providers have been directed to open access to YouTube.\n4. The article notes that the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd has welcomed the lifting of the ban on YouTube.\n5. The article states that the ministry of information technology has said that Google has provided a process for the PTA to request the removal of offending material.\n6. However, the article also quotes a YouTube spokeswoman as saying that government requests for content removal will not be automatically granted and that YouTube has clear community guidelines for removing content.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Pakistan's supreme court has ruled on accessing content on YouTube, but the article does not mention the supreme court or any ruling. Instead, the article focuses on the lifting of the ban on YouTube by the telecoms regulator and the launch of a Pakistan-specific version of the platform. Additionally, the summary does not mention the details of the deal between Google and the government, the denial of claims that the authorities can filter content, or the quotes from the PTA official and the YouTube spokeswoman."}
