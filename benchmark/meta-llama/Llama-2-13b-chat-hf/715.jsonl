The summary implies that Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has warned that a new European law on human rights should be lifted.\n2. However, the article does not attribute any statement to Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban regarding a new European law on human rights. Instead, it quotes Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Peter Szijjarto, expressing Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and its objections to specific EU objections related to asylum seekers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and a higher education law. The article also mentions the concerns raised by EU institutions but does not mention a new European law on human rights or any statement from Prime Minister Viktor Orban on this specific topic.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, attributing statements to Hungary's Prime Minister that are not supported by the article and mischaracterizing the content of the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and NGOs, as well as a higher education law that could lead to the closure of the Central European University (CEU).\n2. The article also mentions that Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw these laws.\n3. The summary, on the other hand, states that Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, has warned that a new European law on human rights should be lifted.\n4. There is no mention in the summary of the EU's objections to Hungary's laws or the pressure from European institutions.\n5. Therefore, the summary does not provide all the information supported by the article.\n\nBased on these points, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article. The summary does not include all the information provided in the article, and it focuses on a different issue (a new European law on human rights) that is not the main focus of the article."}
