While the summary mentions the rising use of tablet computers in schools, it does not accurately reflect the findings of the study regarding the lack of clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using these devices. Additionally, the summary does not mention the other findings of the study, such as the high use of tablet computers among pupils at home and the positive impact of technology on motivation and family involvement."}
