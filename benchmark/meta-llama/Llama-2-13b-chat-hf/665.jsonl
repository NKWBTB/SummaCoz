The article mentions that the meeting will be held at 11:00 BST and that the CPS will decide whether charges should be brought against 23 suspects related to the Hillsborough disaster.\n3. The article notes that the inquests into the deaths of the 96 football fans were concluded last year, and that the CPS is reviewing the evidence relating to the suspects.\n4. The summary states that the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster will be reviewed.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster will be reviewed, but the article does not mention anything about the inquests being reviewed. Instead, the article focuses on the CPS's decision to bring charges against suspects related to the disaster. The information in the summary is not supported by the article."}
