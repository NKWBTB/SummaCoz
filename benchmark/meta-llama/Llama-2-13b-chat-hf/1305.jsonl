Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Matt Reid made 37 appearances for Coventry City last season, which suggests that he was a member of the team that was relegated from League One.\n2. The summary states that Colchester United have signed Matt Reid on a one-month loan deal, which implies that he is now a member of the League Two side.\n3. However, the article does not mention anything about Colchester United or Matt Reid being signed by the club. The article only mentions that Matt Reid could make his debut for the U's in Wednesday's EFL Cup first-round tie against Championship side Aston Villa.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention that Matt Reid has been signed by Colchester United, only that he could make his debut for the club in the EFL Cup. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
