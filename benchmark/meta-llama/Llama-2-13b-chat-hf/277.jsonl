Tighter measures:\u00a0Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation\u2019s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that \"Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years.\" This is consistent with the summary, which states that \"migrants who come to britain to live or work must prove they have committed a crime.\"\n2. The article goes on to say that \"Foreigners from outside the EU will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country before being given a visa to enter the UK.\" This is consistent with the summary, which mentions that \"eu will be forced to provide a criminal records certificate from their home country.\"\n3. The article states that the purpose of this new measure is to \"bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK.\" This is consistent with the summary, which mentions that \"ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals.\"\n4. The article notes that the scheme will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, which is consistent with the summary's mention of \"under the scheme.\"\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary accurately captures the main points of the article, including the requirement for criminal records certificates from home countries and the purpose of preventing serious and violent criminals from entering the UK. Therefore, the answer is yes."}
