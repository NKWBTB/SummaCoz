Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the series is about the future of robots and how our relationship with them is changing.\n2. The summary only mentions that the world's newest generation of robots are changing.\n3. The article provides more specific information about the content of the series, such as Ricky traveling the country to meet robots and scientists, and getting a brain scan.\n4. The summary does not provide any specific information about the content of the series, other than the fact that the world's newest generation of robots are changing.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides more specific information and context about the series, while the summary is more general and lacks detail. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
