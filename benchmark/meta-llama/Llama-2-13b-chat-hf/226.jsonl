The article states that Lopes is on a season-long loan from Lille, but does not mention anything about remaining at the club beyond the loan period.\n3. The summary states that Lopes is yet to appear in a Premier League match for City.\n4. The article states that Lopes has made four cup appearances for City last season, but does not mention anything about not appearing in Premier League matches.\n5. The summary states that Lopes has revealed he is enjoying his loan spell in Lille.\n6. The article does not mention anything about Lopes' enjoyment of his loan spell in Lille.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. The summary mentions that Lopes could remain at Lille, but the article does not provide any information about Lopes' future plans or whether he would like to stay at the club beyond the loan period. Additionally, the summary states that Lopes has yet to appear in a Premier League match for City, but the article does not mention this.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article is: NO."}
