However, the article provides information about the casting for Disney's live-action adaptation of \"Beauty and the Beast,\" including the roles various actors are playing.

There is no repetition of the phrase \"oscar-winning\" or \"oscar winner\" in the article, and it doesn't specify which actress is being referred to with these terms.\n3.

The article mentions that Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad will also star in the film, but the summary does not mention them.\n4. The article mentions that Bill Condon will direct the movie, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include any information about the actors or the director mentioned in the article.
