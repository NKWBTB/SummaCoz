The summary states that Ireland ran in nine tries as they beat Afghanistan in the final of the first twenty20 international in Afghanistan.\n2. However, the article is about a cricket match between Ireland and Afghanistan, and it does not mention Ireland running in nine tries or playing rugby. Instead, the article discusses the scores and performance in a cricket match.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which mentions \"tries,\" a term related to rugby, instead of \"runs,\" which is the relevant term for a cricket match.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Ireland made 165-5 in their 20 overs, while the summary says Ireland ran in nine tries. This is inconsistent, as there is no mention of Ireland scoring nine tries in the article.\n2. The article mentions that Afghanistan made 171-4 in their 20 overs, while the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the summary should have included this information if it were a accurate summary of the match.\n3. The article mentions that Ireland suffered an early blow when opener Paul Stirling was dismissed for a duck, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the summary should have included this information if it were a accurate summary of the match.\n4. The article mentions that Afghanistan's Samiullah Shenwari and Mohammad Shahzad scored 56 and 47 respectively, but the summary does not mention this. This is inconsistent, as the summary should have included this information if it were a accurate summary of the match.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary omits important information about the match, such as the scores of the teams and the early dismissal of Paul Stirling, and includes inaccurate information, such as the claim that Ireland ran in nine tries. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
