The article states that the council is repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain, but the summary does not mention anything about drainage systems or heavy rain.\n3. The summary mentions that repairs have been carried out to a major drainage system, but the article does not mention any specific drainage system being repaired.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions repairs to a drainage system, but the article does not provide any information about drainage systems being repaired.
