The summary implies that a teacher who admitted having sex with a 12-year-old boy has been struck off the profession.\n2. However, the article only mentions that Geaney had \"condoned and participated in an industry that violates and abuses children\" and does not specify the age of the children.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary where the information not mentioned in the article is added.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Timothy Geaney was made the subject of a community payback order and was put on the sex offenders register. This suggests that he was convicted of a sexual offense.\n2. The article also states that Geaney admitted taking or permitting the images to be taken between April 2004 and February 2014. This implies that he was involved in the production or distribution of child pornography.\n3. The article notes that the images were of young boys partially dressed in erotic poses with no sexual activity. This suggests that the images were not of actual sexual activity, but rather of children in suggestive or explicit poses.\n4. The article states that the General Teaching Council Scotland hearing found that Geaney had \"condoned and participated in an industry that violates and abuses children.\" This suggests that Geaney was involved in the production or distribution of child pornography, and that his actions were not just a one-time mistake, but rather part of a pattern of behavior.\n5. The article notes that the panel found Geaney to be unfit to teach and removed him from the professional register. This suggests that Geaney's actions were not only illegal, but also violated the standards of the teaching profession.\n\nBased on these points, it seems clear that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary states that Geaney was \"struck off the profession\" for having sex with a 12-year-old boy, which is supported by the article's mention of Geaney's conviction and removal from the professional register. The summary does not mention the specific details of the images or Geaney's pattern of behavior, but these details are also supported by the article. Therefore, the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is: YES."}
