Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) approved the screening of the film with a \"minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film.\" This suggests that the film was reviewed and deemed acceptable for screening, despite the \"gay moment\" in question.\n2. The article also notes that the LPF chairman, Datuk Abdul Hamid, stated that the film has been approved and can be screened, but the date of screening and where it takes place is not under the LPF's jurisdiction. This implies that the film has been given the green light for release in Malaysia.\n3. The summary states that the film was found to be \"too gay\" and was therefore banned in Malaysia. However, this is not supported by the article, which states that the film was approved for screening with a minor edit.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention any ban on the film, and instead states that it has been approved for screening with a minor edit. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
