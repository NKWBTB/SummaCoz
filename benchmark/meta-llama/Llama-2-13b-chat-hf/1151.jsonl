Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Chinese authorities have arrested 21 people suspected of selling fake stockpiles.\n2. The article does not mention anything about journalists or stock market officials being arrested.\n3. The article does mention that Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading, and that the Tianjin explosions killed 150 people and injured many more.\n4. The article also mentions that Chinese authorities have tightly controlled information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumors.\n5. The summary, on the other hand, only mentions that Chinese authorities have arrested 21 people suspected of selling fake stockpiles.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary does not include all of the information in the article. Specifically, the summary does not mention the arrests of journalists or stock market officials, the stock market slump, or the Tianjin explosions. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nSo, the answer is no. The summary is not consistent with the article."}
