Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the SNP won 56 of the 59 Westminster constituencies in the general election, making them the third largest party at Westminster.\n2. According to parliamentary convention, the official third largest party at Westminster gets to chair a number of select committees.\n3. The article mentions that the SNP will be chairing the energy and climate change select committee and the Scottish affairs select committee.\n4. The article quotes the SNP chief whip, Mike Weir, as saying that these committees are especially important to Scotland, and that the SNP chairing them will allow them to make progress on important issues and get the best deal for Scotland.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a \"holyrood committee\" setting up a committee to give MPs more powers to the Scottish Parliament, but the article does not mention anything about a holyrood committee or giving MPs more powers to the Scottish Parliament. Instead, the article focuses on the SNP's appointment to chair two select committees at Westminster."}
