The summary states that bristol rovers have signed striker jeremy clarkson on loan from brentford until the end of the season.\n2. However, the article only mentions that Clarkson played for Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, but the summary only mentions Bristol Rovers. This is inconsistent, as the article does not mention Bristol Rovers at all.\n2. The article states that Clarkson has been playing for St Mirren this season, and has featured mainly as a substitute. The summary does not mention St Mirren or any other team that Clarkson has played for.\n3. The article states that Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level, but the summary does not mention any specific clubs or appearances.\n4. The article states that Clarkson has been training hard and is ready to play, but the summary does not mention any details about his fitness or readiness to play.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions Bristol Rovers, but the article does not mention them at all. Additionally, the summary does not provide any specific details about Clarkson's appearances, fitness, or readiness to play, which are all mentioned in the article. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
