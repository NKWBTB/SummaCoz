The summary does not mention anything about Barrow or the mutual consent aspect of Anderson's transfer.\n3. The article mentions that Anderson has played for other clubs in the past, including Aldershot and Exeter, but the summary only mentions that he was released by a National League club (without specifying which one).\n4. The article states that Anderson is a centre-back, but the summary only mentions a striker (Myles Anderson) being signed by Torquay United.\n5. The article mentions that Keating, another player signed by Torquay United, has had spells with other clubs and is subject to international clearance, but the summary does not mention anything about Keating.\n\nBased on these differences, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief overview of the transfer, but it does not include all the details mentioned in the article. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
