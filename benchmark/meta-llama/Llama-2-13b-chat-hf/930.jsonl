Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Radamel Falcao moved to Manchester United on a season-long loan last summer.\n2. The summary mentions that Falcao has struggled for Manchester United during his season-long loan.\n3. The article states that Louis van Gaal's side will have to pay \u00a346million to make Falcao's transfer permanent.\n4. The summary mentions that Falcao has scored four goals in Louis van Gaal's side.\n5. The article quotes Nabil Dirar, Falcao's former Monaco team-mate, as saying that Falcao was not happy in France and thinks he would have been better off staying at Monaco.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions that Falcao has scored four goals in Louis van Gaal's side, but the article states that he has struggled to score goals and has only scored four all season. Additionally, the summary does not mention Dirar's quote about Falcao not being happy in France, which is a key point in the article. Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article."}
