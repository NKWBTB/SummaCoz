The summary implies that a prison in Essex is \"frightened\" after reports of people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. While the article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the prison wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, it does not mention the prison itself being \"frightened\" or people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a statement not found in the article and misrepresents the prison's reaction to the reported incidents.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the prison in question is in Essex, and the summary does not mention Essex at all. The summary only mentions drones, which is not supported by the article.\n2. The article mentions that the prison has seen \"numerous incidents\" of packages being thrown over the wall, but the summary only mentions drones. This suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect the information provided.\n3. The article states that the prison is taking steps to address the issue, including holding meetings with residents and increasing security measures. The summary does not mention any of these efforts, which suggests that it is not consistent with the article.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions drones, which is not supported by the article, and it does not accurately reflect the information provided. Therefore, the answer is no."}
