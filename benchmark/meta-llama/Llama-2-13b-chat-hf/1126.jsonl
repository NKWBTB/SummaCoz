Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that \"McManus netted from close range on the quarter-hour mark to open the scoring.\" The summary does not mention anything about the scoring being opened by McManus.\n2. The article states that \"Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead.\" The summary does not mention anything about the score being doubled.\n3. The article states that \"A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time.\" The summary does not mention anything about Alloa pulling back into the game.\n4. The article states that \"But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts.\" The summary does not mention anything about the win being comfortable or the names of the players who scored.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the team's name and the fact that they won, but it does not provide any specific information about the game, such as the scoring or the players who contributed to the win. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
