The summary implies that there is a \u00a31.8 million restoration project to transform the east end of Haringey Theatre into a theatre.\n2. However, the article does not mention a specific \u00a31.8 million restoration project for the east end of Haringey Theatre. The article primarily discusses the restoration of Alexandra Palace's theatre, which is located in North London, and the funds allocated for this project.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces unrelated information about Haringey Theatre and a specific budget not found in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the theatre was founded in 1875, but the summary does not include this information.\n2. The article states that the theatre will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy, and live music, but the summary only mentions \"a theatre\".\n3. The article mentions that the BBC studios at the eastern end of the Palace will also be repaired and refurbished, but the summary does not include this information.\n4. The article states that the theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project, but the summary does not mention this.\n5. The article mentions that the Heritage Lottery Fund is contributing \u00a318.8m towards the project, but the summary does not include this information.\n6. The article states that the entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of \u00a326.6m, but the summary does not mention this.\n7. The article mentions that the Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust has committed to raising the final \u00a31m by summer 2017, but the summary does not include this information.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief and incomplete overview of the project, while the article provides a more detailed and comprehensive description of the restoration plans for the east end of the theatre. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
