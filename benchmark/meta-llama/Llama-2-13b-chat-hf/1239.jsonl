Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the university said the move at Singleton Park was \"precautionary\". This suggests that the university took action to ensure the safety of students and staff, rather than because of a suspicious explosion.\n2. The article states that South Wales Police received a call about concerns regarding the safe storage of chemicals before a controlled explosion took place. This suggests that the explosion was not suspicious, but rather a precautionary measure to ensure the safe disposal of the chemicals.\n3. The article states that nobody was injured in the incident, and a police spokesman said the cordon was precautionary while the chemicals were removed. This suggests that there was no risk to the public and no one was harmed during the incident.\n4. The article states that the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals \"had become unstable\". This suggests that the explosion was a controlled and planned event, rather than a suspicious or unexpected one.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that a student was taken to hospital after a \"suspicious\" explosion, but the article does not support this claim. Instead, the article suggests that the explosion was a precautionary measure to ensure the safe disposal of chemicals, and there was no risk to the public. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
