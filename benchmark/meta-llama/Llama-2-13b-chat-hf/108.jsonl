Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Michael Phelps was banned from competing for six months due to his second drink-driving offense.\n2. The ban was set to run out in early April, which means it would have ended before the world championships in Kazan.\n3. The article quotes USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus as saying that there is a \"pathway for things to be reconsidered\" regarding Phelps' ban.\n4. Based on this statement, it is possible that Phelps' ban could be lifted or modified, allowing him to compete in the world championships.\n\nBased on these points, the summary statement \"Phelps' punishment was due to run out for the world championships in Kazan\" is not entirely accurate. While Phelps' ban was set to run out in early April, there is a possibility that he may be allowed to compete in the world championships if his punishment is reconsidered or modified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
