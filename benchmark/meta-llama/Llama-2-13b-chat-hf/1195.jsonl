The summary mentions an eruption in the Atlantic Ocean. This is inconsistent with the article, as the article does not mention any eruption in the Atlantic Ocean.\n3. The article mentions a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it, which is being used to explore the Mariana Trench.\n4. The summary does not mention any submarine or camera. Instead, it mentions a tiny camera that has been caught up in an eruption. This is inconsistent with the article, as the article does not mention any camera being caught up in an eruption.\n\nTherefore, based on the inconsistencies listed above, I can conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article.
