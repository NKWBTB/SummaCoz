Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the boy was struck in Coatbridge, while the summary only mentions \"north lanarkshire.\" This is a discrepancy, as Coatbridge is a specific location within North Lanarkshire.\n2. The article provides the exact location of the incident as Bank Street near Langloan Primary School, while the summary does not include this information.\n3. The article states that the boy was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, while the summary does not mention the hospital or the location of the boy's treatment.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide all the information that is included in the article, and it does not accurately convey the details of the incident. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
