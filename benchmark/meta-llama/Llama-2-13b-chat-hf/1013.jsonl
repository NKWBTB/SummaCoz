Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that OpenAI, a venture backed by Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Indian tech giant Infosys, and Amazon Web Services, has pledged $1 billion to research and develop artificial intelligence (AI).\n2. The article also mentions that the venture aims to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity, without the need for financial return.\n3. The article quotes Mr. Musk as saying that AI is humanity's biggest existential threat, and British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking as warning that AI could potentially re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate, superseding humans.\n4. However, the article also notes that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions Google pledging $1 billion to research and develop AI, but the article mentions that OpenAI, a venture backed by several companies and individuals, has made the pledge. Additionally, the summary does not mention the venture's goal of advancing digital intelligence for the benefit of humanity, or the warnings from Musk and Hawking about the potential risks of AI."}
