{"document": "Manchester City have apologised to supporters and promised to hand out ticket refunds after coaches they laid on for free were delayed and missed the kick-off at Crystal Palace. The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train.

Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn\u2019t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester.

'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of \u00a312,000.

The summary mentions \"free\" and \"UNK the money,\" which are not present in the article. Additionally, the summary does not accurately convey the information in the article, as it does not mention the apology or refunds promised by Manchester City."}
