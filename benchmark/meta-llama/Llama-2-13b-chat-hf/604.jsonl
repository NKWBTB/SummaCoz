However, the article does not mention a woman being sentenced for sex offenses. The article discusses the case of Clive Weatherhogg, a man who was found guilty of coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man. The charges and sentences in the article are related to Clive Weatherhogg, a man, not a woman.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Clive Weatherhogg was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with a man, and of intentionally causing the woman's sister and father to look at sexual images.\n2. The article does not mention anything about the woman being sentenced to prison. Instead, it states that Weatherhogg was found guilty and that the case was remitted to the High Court in Edinburgh for sentencing.\n3. The summary, on the other hand, states that a woman has been sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against a woman and a woman.\n4. Based on the information in the article, there is no mention of the woman being sentenced to prison. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
