The article does not mention anything about a police officer being charged with manslaughter. In fact, it mentions that the CPS is considering whether to bring charges against 23 suspects, but it does not specify whether any of those suspects are police officers.\n3. The summary states that a police officer has been charged with the manslaughter of a man who was injured in the Hillsborough disaster.
