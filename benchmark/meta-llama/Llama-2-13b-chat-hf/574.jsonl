The article quotes Pochettino as saying that his team showed a lack of desire to play for a win and that it is difficult to fight for the Premier League title if they continue to play like that.\n3.

The summary states that Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino says his side needs to be ready to challenge for the Premier League title.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article focuses on Spurs' struggles and Pochettino's criticism of his team's performance, while the summary mentions Chelsea and their need to be ready to challenge for the Premier League title. There is no mention of Spurs or their struggles in the summary, which suggests that it is not consistent with the article."}
