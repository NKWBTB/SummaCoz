Lured away: Online ads promises British doctors \u2018more money\u2019 and \u2018great earning potential\u2019 if they leave Britain for Australia (file image) Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the situation as worrying and promised to make \u2018important changes\u2019 to the NHS to ease the pressure on GPs. Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs \u00a3850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered. It follows the Mail\u2019s revelation last week how one practice, in Swinton, South Yorkshire, was making patients wait four weeks for an appointment. Krishna Kasaraneni, a GP at the Crown Street Surgery, told Inside Out that three of its doctors had moved to Australia and Canada since last summer due to \u2018unsustainable daily pressure\u2019. The programme, being broadcast tonight, also obtained figures from the General Medical Council that revealed 792 GPs were given \u2018Certificates of Good Standing\u2019 last year to allow them to practise abroad. This compares to 576 in 2008 and 562 in 2009. Crisis:\u00a0Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs \u00a3850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered (file photo) The NHS is currently advertising in medical magazines in Australia to try to lure back British doctors, promising a \u2018fully funded induction and returner scheme\u2019. On top of the exodus to foreign climes, 56 per cent of GPs \u2018definitely\u2019 or \u2018probably\u2019 expect to leave the profession before their 60th birthday, according to a survey of 1,004 family doctors carried out by Inside Out. Dr David Jones, 46, who formerly practised in Manchester, moved to Perth, Western Australia, over a year ago. He said: \u2018We arrived in November 2013. It\u2019s wonderful here. We do 45 hours a week and weekends are off to enjoy the sunshine. I\u2019m very, very proud of what my colleagues at home do. They do an incredibly difficult job. They get assaulted from all sides. \u2018I do feel guilty to some extent. When a government invests so much money in a profession you are a national asset to that country. But the way that asset is being treated in that country, it\u2019s just pushing people away. It\u2019s reached a point where people are just saying no, I\u2019m not doing this any more. \u2018We shouldn\u2019t be here. Had our profession been looked after as it should have been we wouldn\u2019t think about leaving.\u2019 The website GP Jobs in Australia promises British doctors \u2018more money\u2019 and \u2018great earning potential\u2019. It adds: \u2018Typical earnings start from \u00a3145,000 and rise to \u00a3195,000 per annum after a few years\u2019 experience.\u2019 But it says doctors working in rural locations can earn \u2018considerably more\u2019, adding: \u2018Compared to the NHS, there\u2019s less hassle, less bureaucracy, more medicine and money.\u2019 Younger doctors are not plugging the gaps, with up to one in eight GP training posts unfilled. They are instead choosing the more attractive career paths as hospital specialists or surgeons. The situation has become so dire that 1,063 GPs are needed just to return to the patient-to-doctor ratio of 2009, according to separate figures released by the House of Commons Library. Under the previous Labour government, GPs benefited hugely by a new contract that saw average salaries soar to \u00a3105,000 a year and enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend work. But many doctors now say they are dismayed by the volume of paperwork, the demands of the ageing population and the insufficient funds given to surgeries by the Government. Mr Hunt said yesterday: \u2018What I hope GPs recognise is the things they\u2019ve said to us are worrying them are being addressed. 'They said they didn\u2019t like the targets they have, what are called the QOF targets, and we\u2019ve reduced those by 40 per cent. \u2018They said they needed more money to invest in their premises and we put in this extra money in the Autumn Statement. \u2018These things don\u2019t happen overnight so I would urge people to bear with us while we make these really important changes. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \u2018David Cameron promised to put GPs at the heart of the NHS \u2013 but instead caused a new GP recruitment crisis.

The summary also mentions around 22,400 gps -- more than half of england's 40,200 family doctors, but it also missed the next important information in article that \"want to retire before the usual age of 60, separate figures show\". The correct summary should be concise, but it also needs to preserve the original meaning from the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that \"the number of family doctors applying to work in Australia, Canada and other countries has jumped by 40 per cent in just five years.\" This information is not present in the summary.\n2. The article mentions that \"around 22,400 GPs \u2013 more than half of England\u2019s 40,200 family doctors \u2013 want to retire before the usual age of 60.\" This information is not present in the summary.\n3. The article states that \"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the situation as worrying and promised to make \u2018important changes\u2019 to the NHS to ease the pressure on GPs.\" This information is present in the summary, but it is not explicitly stated that Hunt described the situation as worrying.\n4. The article mentions that \"some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs \u00a3850 a day to stand in.\" This information is present in the summary.\n5. The article states that \"the NHS is currently advertising in medical magazines in Australia to try to lure back British doctors, promising a \u2018fully funded induction and returner scheme\u2019.\" This information is not present in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the number of doctors applying to work abroad and the desperation of some surgeries in Cumbria, but it does not include other important information such as the number of GPs wanting to retire early, the Health Secretary's description of the situation as worrying, and the NHS's efforts to lure back British doctors. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
