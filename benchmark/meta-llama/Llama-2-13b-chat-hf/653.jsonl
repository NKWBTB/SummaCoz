Instead, it states that a horse has died after falling from a balcony at Cheltenham's festival.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides specific details about the horse's death, including the cause and the fact that the horse had no underlying health issues. The summary, on the other hand, provides no such details and instead implies that the horse died as a result of falling from a balcony. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
