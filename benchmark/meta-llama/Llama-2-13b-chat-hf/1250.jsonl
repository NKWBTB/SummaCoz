The summary mentions a plan to demolish a five-storey hotel. However, there is no mention of \"a five-storey hotel\".

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the development will include a six-storey, four-star hotel, while the summary only mentions a five-storey hotel. This is a discrepancy that suggests the summary is not consistent with the article.\n2. The article mentions that the development will include two assisted-living apartment blocks, but the summary does not mention this. This is another discrepancy that suggests the summary is not consistent with the article.\n3. The article states that English Heritage objected to the scale of the development, but the summary does not mention this. This is a significant omission that suggests the summary is not consistent with the article.\n4. The article quotes a councillor as saying that the buildings earmarked for demolition were \"nice but no longer necessarily functional,\" but the summary does not include this quote. This is another omission that suggests the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nBased on these discrepancies and omissions, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately convey the information and details included in the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
