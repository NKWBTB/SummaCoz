However, the article does not mention anything about Billericay Town sacking manager Jose Wright or his passing at the age of 88. Instead, it discusses Akil Wright's potential involvement with Billericay Football Club and the club's current status.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary introduces a narrative about the sacking and death of a manager named Jose Wright, while the article does not mention it at all and primarily focuses on Akil Wright's potential deal with Billericay Football Club.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Dan Groves said the \"finer points\" of a deal which could see Wright buy 20% of the club are yet to be released. This suggests that there is a potential deal in place for Wright to buy a stake in the club, but the details have not been fully disclosed.\n2. The article also states that Wright will become a club director if the deal goes through. This suggests that Wright will have a leadership role in the club, which is not consistent with the summary's statement that the club has sacked Wright.\n3. The article mentions that Billericay are eighth in the Isthmian League Premier Division, three points adrift of a play-off place. This suggests that the club is currently performing well and is in a competitive position in the league.\n4. The article states that Wright played non-league football for a succession of clubs, including Lewes, Crawley Town and Rushden & Diamonds. This suggests that Wright has experience playing at a lower level than the Isthmian League Premier Division, which is consistent with the summary's statement that Wright is a former non-league player.\n5. The article mentions that the club has recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said shortly after completing a deal for the club that he was \"comfortable\" investing \u00a310,000 a week. This suggests that the club has new ownership and is receiving significant investment, which is consistent with the summary's statement that the club has new owners.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Wright has been sacked, but the article does not mention any such thing. Instead, the article suggests that there is a potential deal in place for Wright to buy a stake in the club and that he will become a club director if the deal goes through. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
