Truck: A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety . Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, said that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor . Rare:\u00a0spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being darted, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine . A necropsy will be performed on the mountain lion. A spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being struck with a tranquilizer, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine. 'They tried to do the right thing,' Foy told NBC. 'They have the training and equipment to do the right thing... and it doesn't always work out.' A witness told KTLA\u00a0that the animal was underneath a trailer for about 45 minutes before authorities arrived. The mall wasn't open, and only a few store employees were around in the early hours. But the mountain lion was reportedly first spotted near a freeway. The animal was not aggressive, the LAT Times reports. Officials say the animal could have made his way to the mall area for a number of reasons including simply looking for a suitable habitat.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that the mountain lion was seen outside of Macy's at the Promenade Mall in Temecula. The summary does not mention the mall or the location.\n2. The article states that a game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart. The summary mentions a game warden shooting the lion with a tranquilizer dart, but it does not specify that the warden was the one who shot the lion.\n3. The article states that the lion died while it was being transported to a hospital. The summary does not mention the lion dying during transportation.\n4. The article mentions that a necropsy will be performed on the mountain lion to determine the exact cause of death. The summary does not mention a necropsy or any investigation into the cause of death.\n\nBased on these differences, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary leaves out important details, such as the location and the cause of death, and includes some inaccuracies, such as the lion dying during transportation. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
