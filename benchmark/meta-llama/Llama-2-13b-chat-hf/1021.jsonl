Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the UK government will keep Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland up-to-date about negotiations with the EU.\n2. The article quotes David Davis as saying that he wants to hold monthly meetings with the devolved administrations to share analysis and allow them to voice their views on the UK's negotiating strategy.\n3. The article also quotes Michael Russell as saying that the UK government needs to provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions, particularly regarding the single market and customs union.\n4. The summary states that David Davis wants the UK government to discuss the UK's membership of the EU after Brexit.\n\nBased on the information in the article, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. While the article does mention David Davis' desire to discuss the UK's membership of the EU after Brexit, it also emphasizes the need for transparency and clarity from the UK government on its intentions, which is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. Additionally, the summary focuses solely on David Davis' desire for discussions, while the article provides more context and quotes from other officials, such as Michael Russell."}
