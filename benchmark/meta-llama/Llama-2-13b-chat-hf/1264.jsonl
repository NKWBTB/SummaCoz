The article mentions that the judge agreed to postpone the case to allow prosecutors to ask the FBI for help.\n4.

The article mentions that the FBI had previously asked Apple to write new software to gain access to Farook's iPhone.\n6. The summary does not mention anything about Apple or iPhones.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions one sentence about a judge refusing to apologize to the family of an American couple shot dead in the US, but the article discusses a completely different topic, including the FBI's involvement in a homicide case in Arkansas and the use of iPhones. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
