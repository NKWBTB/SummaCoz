Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the survey found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. This suggests that children are being exposed to a variety of foods at school that they may not have tried before.\n2. The article also states that half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. This suggests that children are not only trying new foods at school, but they are also requesting them at home.\n3. The summary states that \"more than half of parents in england are eating sweets.\" However, there is no mention of sweets in the article. In fact, the article only mentions vegetables and does not mention any sugary foods like sweets.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention sweets at all, while the summary states that more than half of parents in England are eating sweets. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
