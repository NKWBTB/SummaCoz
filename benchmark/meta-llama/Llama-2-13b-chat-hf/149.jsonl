The summary implies that the farmer in charge claims the chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, and it presents this information as a new revelation about the conditions on the farms supplying KFC.\n2. However, the article states that the farmer, Andrew, claims the chickens at his farm have a good life, saying he 'wouldn\u2019t mind being a chicken in here.' The summary does not accurately represent the farmer's perspective, as it focuses on the negative aspect of the chickens living for 35 days before being gassed, omitting the farmer's positive comments about their overall well-being.\n3.

The farmer in charge claims that the chickens have a \"very good life.\"\n3. The article mentions that the chickens are kept in conditions that activists say are \"oppressive,\" with tens of thousands of chickens living together in huge sheds.\n4. The article states that the chickens are healthy and have clean feet, according to the farmer.\n5. The article mentions that about 30 million chickens die in the sheds each year due to starvation or dehydration.\n\nBased on these points, here's my conclusion:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. While the summary mentions the chickens are alive and in sheds, it does not mention the conditions in which they are kept, the farmer's claims about their \"very good life,\" or the high mortality rate in the sheds. Additionally, the summary does not mention the activists' claims that the conditions are \"oppressive.\" Overall, the summary does not provide a complete or accurate picture of the conditions in which the chickens are raised for KFC."}
