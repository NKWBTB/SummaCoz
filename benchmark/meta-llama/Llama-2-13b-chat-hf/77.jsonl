The summary only mentions the number of chickens that KFC sells every year, but it does not provide any information about the conditions in which the chickens are raised or the methods used to kill them. The article, on the other hand, provides detailed information about the conditions on the farms that supply KFC with chickens, including the fact that the chickens are kept in huge sheds with tens of thousands of other chickens and that they are gassed after they reach a certain weight. The article also includes quotes from a farmer and animal rights campaigners, which provide additional context and perspectives on the issue."}
