Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. This means that the majority of children in England who eat school lunches are trying new foods at school that they do not eat at home.\n2. The article also states that half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. This suggests that children are asking for the new foods they have tried at school to be prepared at home, which further supports the idea that children are trying new foods at school.\n3. The summary states that one in five parents in England eat vegetables at home. This is not supported by the article, as the article does not mention vegetables specifically or the proportion of parents who eat them at home.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article focuses on the variety of foods that children are trying at school, while the summary only mentions vegetables and the proportion of parents who eat them at home. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
