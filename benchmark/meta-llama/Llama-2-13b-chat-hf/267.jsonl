The other creative duo, Valentino designers, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, have really breathed new life into the iconic brand and we've been swooning over their collections for the last few seasons. We've fallen head over heels for their ethereal gowns and been floored by their rainbow bright stripes this season. And one of our favorite prints from the fashion house is this red and white rendered one. Just a few days we spotted Amanda Seyfried wearing a very similar pussy bow style from the Pre-Fall 2015 line for her stint on the red carpet at the While We're Young premiere in New York. Both dresses are really conveying that 1970s vibe we're all rocking right now.

The high-end fashion brand, which is usually known for its beautiful gowns and must-have accessories,  released the pictures from the stars' shoot earlier this week - prompting speculation that the label's designs will actually be featured in the upcoming Zoolander 2 movie. 'Does this mean that Valentino are going to be making the Zoolander 2 clothes? (sic)' on person tweeted, while another added: 'Zoolander and Valentino are the dream team.' But despite the immense popularity of the first Zoolander movie, which was released back in 2001, Ben admitted that he was shocked to see how excited fans were after the pair made their appearance on the Valentino runway. 'I was a little surprised,' the 49-year-old  said about the reaction. 'I mean it's been 15 years since the movie came out so we really didn't know if people remembered or cared, and it was nice to know that there was a little bit of a connection there that people had.' Strike a pose: Ben and Owen have been in Paris for a couple of weeks to promote the sequel to their 2001 comedy Zoolander . Indeed, Ben and Owen's commitment to ensuring they made their Zoolander 2 debut with a bang was admirable. Not only did the pair manage to take some of the spotlight away from a couture fashion house (with its permission, of course) they also did it during one of the world's most respected fashion-focused events, while still earning a round of applause from the fashion community. Ben added however, that he was 'just happy we were able to keep it a surprise and nobody tripped'. 'We thought it would be a fun idea as a way to announce the movie,' he further explained, when asked why they chose Paris Fashion Week to make the announcement. 'We sort of had top three designers or brands that we went to and TJ\u00a0Maxx and Burlington Coat Factory bowed out at the last minute so we went Valentino.'

The original movie  poked fun at the fashion world and the duo managed to raise the roof when they stepped back into their comic roles at the end of Valentino's real-life autumn-winter women's collection. Ben even recreated the trademark Blue Steel surprised duck-face look of his  Zoolander character for the chuckling photographers gathered at the venue in the gardens in front of the Louvre museum and Eiffel Tower.
