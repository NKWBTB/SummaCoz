Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the victim was 20 years old, while the summary states that the victim was 83 years old. This is a significant discrepancy and suggests that the summary is not consistent with the article.\n2. The article mentions that the body of the victim was found in a house in Northampton, while the summary does not provide any information about the location of the victim's body. This is another inconsistency that suggests the summary is not accurate.\n3. The article states that the accused, Edward Tenniswood, has been charged with murder and has appeared in court, while the summary only mentions that a man has appeared in court charged with the murder of an 83-year-old woman. This is a third inconsistency that suggests the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
