The summary states that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England last year has more than doubled in the last year.\n3. If the number of plastic bags thrown away in England last year has more than doubled, then it must have increased by more than 200 million since 2013.\n4. However, the article states that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England has only increased by 200 million since 2013.\n5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the number of plastic bags thrown away in England last year has more than doubled, while the article states that the number has only increased by 200 million.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
