The article states that the 24-year-old player was under contract with Mansfield Town, but the team has reached an agreement to bring him in on a free transfer.\n2. The summary states that Mansfield Town has signed the player for an undisclosed fee.\n3. These two statements are contradictory, as the article states that the player was signed on a free transfer, while the summary states that the team has signed him for a fee.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the summary is not consistent with the article. The correct summary should reflect that the player was signed on a free transfer, not for an undisclosed fee.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
