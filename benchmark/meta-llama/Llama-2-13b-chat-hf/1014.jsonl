Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the poverty rate in the US was 15% in 2011, which means that 46.2 million Americans were living in poverty.\n2. The article also states that the real median income of households in the country dropped by 1.5%.\n3. The article mentions that the average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011 was $23,021 (\u00a314,300).\n4. The article states that income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011.\n5. The article mentions that the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance fell to 15.7% from 16.3%.\n\nNow, let's compare these points to the summary:\n\nThe summary states that the US population has fallen to its lowest level since records began.\n\nThere is no mention of poverty, income inequality, or health insurance in the summary. The only mention of population is the phrase \"lowest level since records began,\" which does not match the information in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article."}
