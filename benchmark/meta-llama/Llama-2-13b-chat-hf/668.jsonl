The summary implies that the Justice Secretary has said that contraband has been thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses the issues of contraband being thrown over the wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, but it does not attribute this statement to the Justice Secretary.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that there have been \"numerous incidents\" of packages being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison.\n2. The former inmate interviewed in the article claims that the prison is \"notorious\" for being \"flooded\" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis.\n3. The Ministry of Justice spokeswoman acknowledges that there have been incidents of contraband being thrown over the wall, but denies that drones have been used to smuggle goods into the prison.\n4. The spokeswoman notes that laws have been introduced to punish those who smuggle packages over prison walls with up to two years in jail.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions \"contraband\" being thrown over the wall, but the article provides more specific information about the types of items being smuggled (mobile phones and synthetic cannabis) and denies the use of drones in the smuggling process. Additionally, the article mentions the Ministry of Justice's efforts to address the issue and the laws that have been introduced to punish smugglers, which are not mentioned in the summary."}
