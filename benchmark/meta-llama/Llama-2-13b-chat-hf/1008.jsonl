The article mentions that the distillery is the first new distillery in the Borders in nearly 200 years, but the summary does not include this information.\n3. The article highlights the use of local botanicals and the desire to capture the flavour palette of the Teviot valley in the gin. The summary does not mention anything about the use of local ingredients or the focus on capturing the local flavour palette.\n4. The article introduces the name of the distillery, Lilliard Gin, and explains the origin of the name.
