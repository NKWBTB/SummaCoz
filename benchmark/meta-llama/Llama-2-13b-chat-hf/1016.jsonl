The article quotes Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad as saying that a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia, and that the second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups.\n3. The article also states that the Syrian government denies reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison, and that fighting is still going on.\n4. The article mentions that the US has expressed concern that the UN-backed plan to destroy Syria's chemical weapons is falling behind schedule, and that Damascus \"had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment\".\n5. The article quotes Mr. Mekdad as saying that Syria is committed to all its agreements with the OPCW and the UN Security Council, and that it shall implement all its obligations on time.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Syria's government says it is failing to comply with the UN's deadline for the sale of chemical weapons, but the article does not support this claim. In fact, the article states that Syria missed Wednesday's deadline, but also provides reasons for the delay, such as attacks on the shipment of weapons and ongoing fighting in Aleppo. Additionally, the article quotes Mr. Mekdad as saying that Syria is committed to all its agreements and shall implement all its obligations on time, which suggests that Syria is still working towards compliance."}
