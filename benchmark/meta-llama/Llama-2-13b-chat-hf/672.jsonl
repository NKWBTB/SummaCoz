The summary implies that a lollipop lady has been blinded in a \"world upside down\" after admitting causing the death of a lollipop lady.\n2. However, the article does not mention that anyone has been blinded or that a lollipop lady has admitted causing the death of another lollipop lady. The article primarily discusses an accident involving Brian Wright, who is accused of causing serious injury to Sylvia Blackburn, a lollipop lady, and denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The article does not mention any death or a lollipop lady admitting to causing another lollipop lady's death.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces incorrect information about blindness, a lollipop lady's admission of causing death, and a \"world upside down,\" which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Brian Wright admitted causing serious injury to Sylvia Blackburn, but he denies causing her death.\n2. The summary states that Wright caused the death of a lollipop lady.\n3. The article does not mention the death of Sylvia Blackburn, only that she suffered serious head injuries.\n4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it states that Wright caused the death of a lollipop lady, while the article only mentions serious injuries.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
