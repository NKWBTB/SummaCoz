Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Sam Livesey, an 18-year-old footballer, was captured on a clip allegedly punching Jack Tuohy in the face during a match.\n2. The article also states that Tuohy was knocked from his feet by the force of Livesey's punch and spent four hours in the hospital with concussion-like symptoms.\n3. The FA has charged Livesey with violent conduct and believes that the standard three-match ban for violent conduct would be insufficient.\n4. The article quotes a spokesman for the FA as saying that the charge is an allegation and that Livesey has admitted the charge.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that Sam Livesey was captured on a clip of Oldham's Jack Tuohy, but it does not mention the alleged punch or the FA charge. The summary does not provide enough information to accurately summarize the article."}
