The summary implies that a prison official has stated that drones could be used to smuggle drugs into a prison.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. While the article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison, it does not mention a prison official stating that drones could be used for smuggling. The article mentions a former inmate claiming that drones were used but notes that the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which attributes the statement about drones to a prison official while the article does not include such a statement.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The summary states that drones could be used to smuggle drugs into a prison.\n3. The article does not mention anything about drones being used to smuggle drugs into the prison.\n4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions something (drones) that is not supported by the article.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
