The summary states that the Mongolian rapper was beaten with a swastika during a concert in Mongolia.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about the rapper being beaten with a swastika.

The article also emphasizes that the swastika is a traditional symbol in Mongolia and has nothing to do with Nazi ideology.\n4.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the rapper, Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar, was performing in Ulan Bator when the alleged attack took place. The summary does not mention the location of the concert.\n2. The article reports that the rapper was hit over the head with a bottle and repeatedly kicked in the face, causing him to spend 10 days in a coma. The summary does not mention the specific injuries sustained by the rapper.\n3. The article mentions that the Russian embassy is investigating the incident, but calls local press reports \"distorted\". The summary does not mention the Russian embassy's involvement or any distortion of reports.\n4. The article highlights the traditional significance of the swastika in Mongolia and emphasizes that the symbol is not associated with Nazi ideology. The summary does not provide this context or clarification.\n5. The article quotes the rapper's father and lawyer denying reports that the rapper shouted \"Heil Hitler\" during the concert. The summary does not mention these denials.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide the same level of detail or context as the article, and omits several important points, such as the location of the concert, the specific injuries sustained by the rapper, and the Russian embassy's involvement. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
