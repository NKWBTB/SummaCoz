The summary only mentions that the issue of payments to Medicare providers has been a thorny issue for years, but it does not mention the \"doc fix\" or any specific solution to the issue.\n3. The article explains that the bill passed with a broad bipartisan vote and includes a two-year extension of a popular children's health insurance program, but the summary does not mention this information.\n4. The article mentions that some conservative senators, including Ted Cruz, balked at the cost of the bill and pushed for an amendment to have the costs offset, but the summary does not mention this.\n5. The article states that the bill will be signed into law by President Obama, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article. The summary only mentions one aspect of the article (the thorny issue of payments to Medicare providers), but omits many other important details included in the article. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
