The first red flag is the repeated use of the phrase \"Oscar-winning\" in the summary. The article only mentions that the actors have won Oscars once, but the summary exaggerates this by repeating the phrase multiple times.\n2. The second red flag is the lack of specific information about the actors' roles in the summary. The article provides detailed information about each actor's role, but the summary only mentions the actors' names without any context.\n3. The fourth red flag is the lack of information about the film's release date. The article mentions that the film will be released on March 17, 2017, but the summary does not include this information.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Emma Watson, who is an Oscar-winning actress, has been cast as Belle.\n2. The summary does not mention Emma Watson or any other specific actor.\n3. The article mentions that Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, and Josh Gad will also star in the film, but the summary does not mention them.\n4. The article mentions that Bill Condon will direct the movie, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include any information about the actors or the director mentioned in the article.
