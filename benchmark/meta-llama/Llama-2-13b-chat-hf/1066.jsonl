Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that the company is releasing a new Android smartphone, but the summary does not mention anything about Android. Instead, it mentions \"downloading products to android smartphones.\"\n2. The article states that the phone offers improved security over rival Android devices, but the summary does not mention anything about security.\n3. The article mentions that the phone will cost less than the company's previous handset, Priv, but the summary does not mention anything about pricing.\n\nTherefore, based on the inconsistencies listed above, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article."}
