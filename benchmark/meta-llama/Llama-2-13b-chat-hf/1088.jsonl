Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the man fell from a cherry picker at about 13:45 GMT on Thursday, while the summary states that a man fell from a first-floor window on the Isle of Wight. These two locations are not the same, and the article does not mention the Isle of Wight at all.\n2. The article mentions that the police are conducting an investigation, but the summary does not mention any investigation.\n3. The article states that the Health and Safety Executive is also involved in the investigation, but the summary does not mention any involvement of the Health and Safety Executive.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, my answer is:\n\nNO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
