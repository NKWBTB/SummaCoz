{"document": "Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known\u00a0as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

However, the article provides information about septum piercing, but it does not mention the process as \"severing the wall between the two cheeks.\" Instead, it briefly discusses the historical and cultural significance of septum piercing in various regions and its modern use as a fashion trend. The summary's statement about the process of septum piercing is not accurately supported by the article.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the septum piercing is a trend that has been around for years, and that it was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes.\n2. The article also mentions that the septum ring is used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look in the UK, America, and Australia.\n3. However, the summary states that the UNK ring is the process of severing the wall between the two cheeks. This is not supported by the article, as the article only mentions the septum piercing, not the UNK ring.\n4. Additionally, the summary states that the UNK ring is used as a way of controlling and handling bulls, which is not mentioned in the article.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, and it also omits important details mentioned in the article. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
