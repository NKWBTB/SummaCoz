The summary implies that a man accused of causing a pensioner's death by careless driving has told a court he was \"truly sorry\" he had been.\n2. However, the article does not mention that the accident resulted in the pensioner's death. It states that Sylvia Blackburn suffered serious head injuries but does not confirm her death. The article discusses Brian Wright's admission that he struck Mrs. Blackburn but denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. There is no mention of the man admitting to causing her death in the article.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the defendant, Brian Wright, is accused of causing the death of Sylvia Blackburn by dangerous driving.\n2. The summary only mentions that the defendant is accused of causing the death of Sylvia Blackburn, but it does not mention the word \"dangerous\" driving.\n3. The article states that the defendant hit Mrs. Blackburn while she was escorting a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road, and that the traffic lights were red at the time.\n4. The summary does not mention any details about the circumstances of the accident, such as the fact that the traffic lights were red.\n5. The article quotes the defendant as saying that he is \"truly sorry\" for what he has done to Mrs. Blackburn and her family.\n6. The summary does not include any quotes from the defendant.\n\nBased on these differences, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not include all of the information from the article, and it does not accurately convey the details of the accident and the defendant's statements. Therefore, the answer is no."}
