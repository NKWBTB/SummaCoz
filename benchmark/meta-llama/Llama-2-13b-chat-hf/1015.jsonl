The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that three former royal navy frigates could be put up for sale. However, the article states that Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall were decommissioned.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the three former Royal Navy frigates, HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, and HMS Chatham, are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour.\n2. The article also mentions that bidders had until January 23rd to register their interest in the ships, and that viewings are set to take place in late February and March.\n3. The article quotes Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, as saying that she would like to see at least one of the frigates saved from the scrapyard and turned into a reef or diving attraction.\n4. The article also mentions that the Ministry of Defence will consider all options for the frigates to ensure the best financial return for the taxpayer.\n5. The summary states that three former Royal Navy frigates could be put up for sale in the future.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides specific information about the current location of the frigates, the bidding process, and the potential future of the ships, while the summary only states that the frigates could be put up for sale in the future. The summary does not provide any additional information or context beyond what is already stated in the article."}
