The summary mentions the Women's Equality Commission as EHRC. However, EHRC is \"The Equality and Human Rights Commission\" in the article.\n2. The summary states that the EHRC criticized the company for its \"controversial'sexism' campaign\", but the article does not mention a campaign. Instead, it reports on the company's job advertisements that have been criticized for being sexist and discriminatory.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called Matching Models' ads \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women.\"\n2. The article quotes Rebecca Hilsenrath, the chief executive of the EHRC, as saying that the agency's hiring practices are \"almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation.\"\n3. The article mentions that women's equality campaigners have described the ads as \"straight out of the 1970s.\"\n4. The article quotes Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, as saying that the ads are \"extraordinary\" and \"a timely reminder\" of the need to advance gender equality.\n5. The article states that the agency's founder, Nathalie Jansen, defended the ads, saying that \"looks are important\" to the agency's clients.\n6. The article quotes an employment lawyer, James Lynas, as saying that the ads are \"clearly unlawful\" and that anyone could complain to the EHRC about the agency's hiring practices.\n7. The article mentions that the agency has hired 5,000 people worldwide, including for clients such as MTV, Louis Vuitton, and Harrods.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the EHRC's criticism of the agency's campaign, but it does not provide any details about the specific issues with the ads or the agency's hiring practices. The article, on the other hand, provides several specific examples of how the ads are discriminatory and unlawful, and quotes several experts and campaigners who have criticized the agency's practices. The summary does not convey the same level of detail and criticism as the article."}
