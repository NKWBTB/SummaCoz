All of the information in the summary is supported by the article, including the fact that the Scottish SPCA is calling for new rules on airguns, the cat was injured in a shooting in East Ayrshire, and the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons last year. The summary accurately conveys the main points of the article."}
