Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the last sighting of seahorses at South Beach was in 2013.\n2. The summary mentions nothing about seahorses or South Beach. Instead, it mentions a girl on a yacht in the North Sea.\n3. The article does not mention anything about the North Sea or a girl on a yacht.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article discusses seahorses and their decline in a specific location, while the summary mentions a completely different topic (a girl on a yacht) in a different location (the North Sea). Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
