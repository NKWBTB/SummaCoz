Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, but the summary says he signed for Bristol Rovers on loan from Brentford. These two statements are inconsistent, as Premiership Well and Bristol Rovers are different teams.\n2. The article mentions that Clarkson has been playing for the U20s and training hard to keep his match fitness up, indicating that he is currently a member of the St Mirren team. However, the summary states that he signed for Bristol Rovers on loan, which suggests that he is joining a different team.\n3. The article quotes Clarkson as saying that he is ready to play and has been training hard, which suggests that he is currently fit and available to play for St Mirren. However, the summary states that he signed for Bristol Rovers on loan, which implies that he will be joining a different team and may not be available to play for St Mirren.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Clarkson signed for Bristol Rovers on loan, but the article does not mention this and instead focuses on his current status as a member of the St Mirren team. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
