The summary states that the council has said that businesses and businesses on the Isle of Wight are to be allowed to free up the new chain ferry.\n2. However, the article discusses the issues and challenges faced by the new chain ferry on the Isle of Wight, including breakdowns, grounding, and suspension by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It mentions that the council has made the Cowes crossing free until 2 July for various reasons, but it doesn't explicitly state that this is to \"free up\" businesses.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary implying that the council's decision to make the ferry crossing free is primarily aimed at benefiting businesses, while the article provides a broader context of the ferry's problems and the council's response without specifying that the decision is solely for the benefit of businesses.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the council has ordered a review of the project by auditors due to the \"frustrating and disappointing start\" to the ferry. This suggests that the council is taking a critical look at the project and its performance.\n2. The article mentions that the ferry has broken down, run aground, and been suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to \"training issues\". This indicates that there have been significant problems with the ferry's operation.\n3. The article quotes a shopkeeper who expresses concern about the impact of the ferry's problems on her business, and asks if the council will compensate local businesses for their losses. This suggests that the ferry's issues are having a real-world impact on local businesses.\n4. The article states that the council leader has announced that the crossing at Cowes will be free until 2 July \"in recognition of the problems\" and to allow feedback. This suggests that the council is taking steps to address the issues and is willing to provide some relief to affected businesses and residents.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that businesses will be allowed to use the ferry for free, but it does not mention the significant problems with the ferry's operation or the council's efforts to address these issues. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
