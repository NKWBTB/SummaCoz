The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that Sutton United has signed Akil Wright on a two-year deal.\n2. However, the article states that Akil Wright potentially purchases 20% of Billericay and becomes a club director.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests that Akil Wright has signed with Sutton United on a two-year deal, while the article discusses Akil Wright's potential involvement with Billericay Football Club and becoming a club director.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the deal is for 20% of the club, while the summary only mentions a two-year deal for midfielder Akil Wright. This information is not consistent, as the article mentions a larger investment deal, while the summary only mentions a player transfer.\n2. The article mentions that Wright will become a club director, while the summary does not mention this information. This is another inconsistency, as the article provides additional information about Wright's role beyond just being a player.\n3. The article mentions that the club is in the Isthmian League Premier Division and is three points adrift of a play-off place, while the summary does not provide any information about the club's league position. This is a minor inconsistency, but it suggests that the summary may not be providing a complete picture of the situation.\n4. The article mentions that the club has been taken over by a multi-millionaire investor, while the summary does not mention this information. This is a significant inconsistency, as the article provides important context about the club's ownership and financial situation.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides only a limited amount of information about the deal and does not include several key details mentioned in the article. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
