The summary states \"a motorcyclist killed in a crash with a tractor and a tractor in lincolnshire has been named. \". However, the article states the collision is between a motorcycle and a tractor, not between two tractors. The summary sentence is misleading and not coherent.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the motorcyclist killed in the collision lived locally, but the police have not released any further details about the victim. The summary does not mention the victim's name or any other identifying information.\n2. The article states that the B1191 was closed in both directions between the B1192 Tattershall Road junction in Woodhall Spa and the A158 Jubilee Way junction in Horncastle. The summary does not mention the road closure.\n3. The article appeals for witnesses to the collision to come forward. The summary does not mention anything about witnesses or the police appealing for information.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief and vague description of the crash, while the article provides more detailed information about the location, the parties involved, and the police appeal for witnesses. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
