Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Chechen Muslim clerics met on April 3 and passed a resolution condemning the publication of a report by Chechnya's state news agency.\n2. The resolution called for \"retribution\" against the true instigators of the report, whoever and wherever they are.\n3. The article notes that this amounts to a call for \"reprisals against journalists\" and that the Russian authorities should do everything possible to prevent such actions.\n4. The article also mentions that the report by Novaya Gazeta included allegations of homophobia and human rights abuses in Chechnya, and that the Chechen authorities have denied these allegations.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions a resolution passed by Chechen Muslim clerics condemning the publication of a report, but it does not mention any of the other details included in the article, such as the allegations of homophobia and human rights abuses, the call for \"retribution,\" or the denials by the Chechen authorities. The summary is too brief and does not provide a complete picture of the situation."}
