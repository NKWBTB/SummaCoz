More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the \"most severe public health emergency seen in modern times\" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. \"Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks,\" the latest WHO report said.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the \"most severe public health emergency seen in modern times\" has revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. This suggests that the Ebola epidemic has had a significant impact on global public health systems and has exposed weaknesses in these systems.\n2. The article also states that while the intensity of the epidemic has died down, dozens of new cases are still being reported each week. This indicates that while the epidemic may be subsiding, it is still ongoing and there is a continued risk of new infections.\n3. The article mentions that in Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much that there are more treatment facilities than demand. This suggests that the epidemic has had a significant impact on these countries and that there is a need for continued vigilance to prevent new infections.\n4. However, the article also states that in Guinea, there were reports of 21 unsafe burials and seven confirmed deaths from April 5. This suggests that there are still areas of concern and that the epidemic is not yet under control.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the Ebola epidemic is still ongoing and that there is a continued risk of new infections. Therefore, the statement \"this is the lowest Ebola epidemic in history has died down\" is not consistent with the article. The correct statement would be \"the Ebola epidemic is still ongoing and there is a continued risk of new infections, although the intensity has died down somewhat.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
