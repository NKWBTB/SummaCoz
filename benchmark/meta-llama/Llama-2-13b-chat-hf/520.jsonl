Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the family is from Northern Ireland, but the boy's identity is being protected to maintain his privacy.\n2. The family has been trying to find a special school for the boy, but all the special schools in the South Eastern Education Board area are full to capacity.\n3. The boy's mother has expressed concerns that her son is being isolated at home and is missing out on social interactions with other children.\n4. The family has been told that an extra classroom assistant has been employed at a local special school, but there is no guarantee that the boy will be able to start there.\n5. The mother is worried that the same situation will happen to other families, as the special needs school system is packed to capacity.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that the family is struggling to find a place for the boy, but it does not provide any information about the boy's special needs or the challenges the family is facing in finding a suitable school. The article provides much more detail about the boy's situation and the challenges the family is facing, including the fact that the boy has special needs and that all the special schools in the area are full to capacity."}
