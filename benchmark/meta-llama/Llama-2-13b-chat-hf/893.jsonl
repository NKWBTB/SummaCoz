The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that rick baker will be auctioned off on may 29.\n2. The article states that it is actually rick baker's collection that will be auctioned off on may 29.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the collection of props and puppets from Rick Baker's Cinovation Studio will be auctioned off on May 29th at the Hilton Universal City in Los Angeles, California, and on PropStore.com.\n2. The summary only mentions that the Grinch costume from the Jim Carrey film How the Grinch Stole Christmas is listed at $8,000.\n3. The article provides a detailed list of the items that will be auctioned off, including props and puppets from various films such as Men in Black, Batman Forever, and Gremlins 2: The New Batch.\n4. The summary does not mention any of these films or the other items that will be auctioned off.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one item (the Grinch costume) while the article provides a comprehensive list of items that will be auctioned off. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
