Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the company is releasing a new Android handset, the Dtek50, which offers improved security over rival Android devices.\n2. The article does not mention anything about switching to a different platform or operating system.\n3. The summary states that the company is switching its Android handset in the UK, which is not supported by the article.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article only discusses the release of a new Android handset, while the summary mentions switching to a different platform. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
