The summary does not mention any location or specific details about the incident.\n3. The article mentions that the family is upset and that the victim will be greatly missed.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about the family's feelings or the victim's identity.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
