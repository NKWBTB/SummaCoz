Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Tighter measures:\u00a0Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation\u2019s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade. This would disclose whether they had a clean criminal record or had committed offences. A Home Office spokesman said: \u2018This power will enable us to require those applying for a visa to provide a criminal record certificate covering the last ten years \u2013 an additional tool to help stop criminals from coming to our country.\u2019 Some 1.9million people arriving on visitor visas, or those from 56 countries and territories which do not need visas, will not need to provide their criminal histories because this would be \u2018disproportionate\u2019 in terms of time, cost and bureaucracy.

The article does not mention anything about the EU being subject to these new measures. In fact, it specifically states that the new measures will apply to \"foreigners from outside the EU.\"\n4.
