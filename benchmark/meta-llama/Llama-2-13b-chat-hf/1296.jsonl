Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that UK Sport has cut funding to several Olympic sports, including badminton, basketball, handball, and volleyball.\n2. The article quotes UK Sport CEO Liz Nicholl as saying that the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly and that the organization had to prioritize to protect and enhance the medal potential.\n3. The article also quotes Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy as saying that the decision represents a \"catastrophic impact on the sport\" and that the sport will \"fight for the hopes and dreams\" of its players.\n4.

The summary only mentions that UK Sport has withdrawn funding for Olympic sports, but the article provides more details about the specific sports that have been affected and the reasons for the funding cuts. Additionally, the article mentions the target set by UK Sport for Team GB's medal haul in Tokyo and the investment made in Olympic and Paralympic sports, which are not mentioned in the summary."}
