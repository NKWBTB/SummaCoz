The summary does not mention anything about a second election. Instead, it mentions a fine of up to 50% for an unspecified reason.\n3. The article states that one of the main sticking points in reaching agreement between the two parties is water charges. The summary does not mention water charges or any other specific issues.\n4. The article mentions that Fianna F\u00e1il wants to see the immediate removal of water charges, while Fine Gael sees a role for them. The summary does not mention any specific policies or proposals.\n5. The article states that the two parties are considering a commission to consider the future of national water utility Irish Water. The summary does not mention any such commission or any other specific proposals.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a fine of up to 50% for an unspecified reason, while the article focuses on the negotiations between Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il to form a government and the sticking points in reaching agreement. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
