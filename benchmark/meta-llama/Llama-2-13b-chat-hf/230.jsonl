VIDEO: Scroll down to watch sickening alleged punch that knocks out Oldham youngster . Jack Touhy is struck from behind in the head, apparently with no provocation, by an opponenent . The Oldham youth player is knocked from his feet by the force of Sam Livesey's alleged punch . A red card for violent conduct would normally carry a three-match ban but officials believe such a punishment may be too lenient and have stepped in. A spokesman for the FA said: 'The charge is an allegation that Mr Livesey's behaviour in or around the 71st minute constitutes violent conduct in circumstances where the standard punishment that would otherwise apply following his dismissal is clearly insufficient.' It is understood that Livesey, on loan to Morecambe from Preston North End, has admitted the charge. His case will now be heard by an Independent Regulatory Commission. Livesey has now been charged with violent conduct by the FA and is understood to have admitted the charge . Tuohy spent four hours at hospital after the game after complaining of concussion-like symptoms . Morecambe say they are dealing with the matter internally. A spokesman for Preston North End said: 'At the time of the incident, Sam Livesey was playing for Morecambe and we therefore have no comment to make.'

The summary states sam livesey, 18, was captured on a clip of oldham's jack tuohy. But the truth in article is Sam Livesey, 18, was captured on a clip obtained by Sportsmail appearing to strike Oldham's unsuspecting Jack Tuohy in the temple, it was capture by Sportsmail not the oldham's jack tuohy.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that Sam Livesey, an 18-year-old footballer, was captured on video allegedly punching Jack Tuohy in the face during a match.\n2. The FA has charged Livesey with violent conduct, and officials believe that the standard three-match ban for violent conduct may be too lenient in this case.\n3. Tuohy was knocked from his feet by the force of Livesey's punch and spent four hours in the hospital with concussion-like symptoms.\n4. The article quotes a spokesman for the FA as saying that the charge is an allegation that Livesey's behavior in or around the 71st minute constitutes violent conduct.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not mention the video footage of the alleged punch, nor does it mention that Tuohy was knocked from his feet or spent time in the hospital. Additionally, the summary does not mention the FA's belief that a standard three-match ban may be too lenient, or the fact that the charge is an allegation. Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate summary of the article."}
