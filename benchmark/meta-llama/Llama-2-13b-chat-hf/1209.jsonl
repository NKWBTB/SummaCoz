Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Anzac Day commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One, which was the Gallipoli landings.\n2. The summary does not mention the Gallipoli landings or any specific battle. Instead, it refers to a day of celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of an unspecified event.\n3. The article mentions that the national anthems of New Zealand and Australia were sung during the service, which suggests that the event commemorated was related to both countries.\n4. The summary does not mention any joint events or commemorations involving both New Zealand and Australia.\n5. The article states that the service was held at Westminster Abbey, which is a prominent location in London.\n6. The summary does not mention any location or venue for the celebrations.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article commemorates a specific historical event (the Gallipoli landings) and focuses on the sacrifices of Australian and New Zealand forces, while the summary refers to a day of celebrations without specifying any particular event or historical context. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
