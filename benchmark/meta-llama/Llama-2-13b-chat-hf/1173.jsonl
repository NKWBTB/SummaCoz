Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that J.K.

The article also mentions that Rowling had been called \"a traitor\" for her political views and had blocked some abusive Twitter users she believed had been supporters of the Scottish National Party (SNP).\n3. However, the summary states that the SNP has hit back at Twitter after Rowling tweeted that she's not doing enough to protect her from abusive behavior.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it appears that the SNP is not the one who is hitting back at Twitter, but rather Rowling is the one who is expressing her concerns about abusive behavior on the platform. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nSo, the answer is no. The summary is not consistent with the article."}
