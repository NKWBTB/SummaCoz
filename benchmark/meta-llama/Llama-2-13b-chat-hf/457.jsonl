However, the article also states that Unite regional officer Steve Harley said that all current agreements would be honored, including the pension scheme.\n4.

The summary states that the turkey co-founder Bernard Matthews has been given the green light by the Unite union, but there is no mention of this in the article. The article focuses on the takeover of the company by Ranjit Boparan and the assurances given by Unite that the existing pension scheme would be honored."}
