The prosecution alleges that Ms. Rose failed to detect Mr. Barker's swollen optic discs during a routine eye test and did not refer him for further investigation, which led to his death.\n3. The article quotes the prosecutor, Jonathan Rees QC, as saying that Ms. Rose's conduct was \"so far below the expected standard it was criminal.\"\n4. The article states that the prosecution alleges that Mr. Barker's death was preventable and would have been prevented had Ms. Rose done her job properly.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
