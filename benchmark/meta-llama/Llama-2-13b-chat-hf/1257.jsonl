{"document": "It works by looking for a combination of \"markers\" in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease.\nDelegates at the Alzheimer's Research UK Conference heard that the University of Nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics.\nIt could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said.\nThe test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and APOE.\nBut through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease.\nMost notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test.\nProf Kevin Morgan from the University of Nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients.\nBut he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising.\n\"Our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's using a blood test.\n\"As blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.\"\nHe said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment.\nIt could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained.\nPotentially, it could be a \"cheap and easy pre-screen\" test which enabled Alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said.\n\"The way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk.\n\"If they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing.\"\nDr Eric Karran, director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"Giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the test uses a combination of markers in the blood to distinguish between healthy people and those with Alzheimer's disease.\n2. The summary only mentions an \"international test for Alzheimer's disease\" without providing any information about the markers used in the test.\n3. The article highlights the potential benefits of the test, including earlier diagnosis, better treatments, and more accurate diagnosis.\n4. The summary does not mention any of these potential benefits, and only states that the test has been developed.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide enough information about the test to determine if it is consistent with the article's details. The article provides specific information about the markers used in the test and the potential benefits of the test, while the summary only mentions the existence of the test without providing any additional information. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
