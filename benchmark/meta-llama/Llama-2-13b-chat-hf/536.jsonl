However, the article discusses a situation where Peter Wright may potentially buy 20% of a football club (Billericay), and it mentions that he could become a club director. \n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Peter Wright is a celebrity reality TV star, but the summary does not mention this.\n2. The article states that Wright is set to take over at Billericay Town, but the summary does not mention the name of the club.\n3. The article mentions that Wright will become a club director, but the summary does not mention this.\n4. The article mentions that the deal is yet to be released, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not include all the information provided in the article, and it also includes some inaccuracies (such as the mention of \"celebrity reality tv star timericayericay town\"). Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
