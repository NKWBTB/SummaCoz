Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the testimonial game will be played between Manchester United and Everton, which is Rooney's only two professional clubs. The summary does not mention anything about Manchester United playing against Manchester United.\n2. The article mentions that the game will be streamed globally, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n3. The article states that the proceeds from the game will be distributed to Rooney's four chosen charities, but the summary does not mention anything about charities.\n4. The article mentions that the game will mark Rooney's 12 years of service at Manchester United, but the summary does not mention this.\n5. The article mentions that the game will be the first home appearances for Jose Mourinho's three summer signings, but the summary does not mention anything about the signings.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions Rooney playing for Manchester United, but the article provides much more information about the game, including the charities that will benefit from the proceeds, the global streaming of the game, and the first home appearances of the summer signings. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
