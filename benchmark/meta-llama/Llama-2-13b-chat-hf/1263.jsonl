Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Barca were poor in the first half but looked set to close the gap on unbeaten Real to three points before Ramos headed home Modric's free-kick. This suggests that Barca were not at their best in the first half, but they still had chances to win the game.\n2. The article also states that Enrique was happy to see captain Andres Iniesta return from an injury that has kept him out for six weeks. Iniesta came on as a second-half substitute and set up a Lionel Messi chance, which the Argentine missed, with a brilliant through ball. This suggests that Iniesta's return was a positive for Barca, and he was able to contribute to the team's performance.\n3. The article quotes Enrique as saying that his side's performance was not the best, but they deserved to win. This suggests that Enrique was not entirely satisfied with his team's performance, but he still believed that they deserved to win the game.\n4. The summary states that Barca's performance in their 2-1 win over Real Madrid at the Nou Camp was \"over.\" This is not supported by the article, as the article states that Barca's performance was not the best, but they deserved to win.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not suggest that Barca's performance was \"over,\" but rather that they had a mixed performance and deserved to win the game. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article's content."}
