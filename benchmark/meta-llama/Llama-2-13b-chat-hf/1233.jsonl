The summary states that Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) coaches have appointed Martyn McBryde as their new coaches, which is not supported by the article. The article mentions that McBryde will assume head coach responsibilities for the third time, but does not mention him being appointed as a new coach. Additionally, the article mentions that the WRU will appoint assistant coaches for the summer tour, but the summary does not mention this."}
