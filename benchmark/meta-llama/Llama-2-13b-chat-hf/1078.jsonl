Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Vincent Barker died in July 2012, five months after he had a routine eye test at Boots in Ipswich.\n2. The prosecution alleges that the eye specialist, Honey Rose, failed to detect Vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test and did not refer him for further investigation, which is at the heart of the prosecution case.\n3. The prosecution argues that Vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had Ms. Rose done her job properly.\n4. The article states that Ms. Rose denies a charge of gross negligence manslaughter.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, here is my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a man accused of murdering Vincent Barker 30 years ago, but there is no mention of this in the article. The article only discusses the death of Vincent Barker in 2012 and the gross negligence manslaughter charge against Honey Rose. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
