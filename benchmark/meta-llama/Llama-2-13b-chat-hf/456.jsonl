The summary mentions a new pension scheme to restore Bernard Matthews' chicken and chicken with guarantees from the Unite union.\n2. However, the article does not provide any information about a new pension scheme related to chicken restoration. It focuses on the continuity of existing pension arrangements and the new owner's plans to make the business more profitable through investments and cost savings.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the new owners of Bernard Matthews, Ranjit Boparan, have given guarantees that all current agreements will be honored, including the pension scheme.\n2. The article also mentions that the existing pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that current employees have an alternative pension scheme that is unaffected by the takeover.\n3. The summary states that a new pension scheme will be introduced to restore Bernard Matthews's chicken business.\n\nBased on the information above, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about a new pension scheme being introduced, and instead emphasizes that the current pension arrangements will continue under the new ownership. The summary, on the other hand, mentions a new pension scheme being introduced to restore the chicken business, which is not supported by the article."}
