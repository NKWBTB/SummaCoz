The summary states that a man has been jailed for eight years after being convicted of attempting to blackmail a woman and sexual activity with her boyfriend.\n2. However, the article does not mention that the man was convicted of \"attempting to blackmail a woman and sexual activity with her boyfriend.\" Instead, the article provides information about Clive Weatherhogg, who was found guilty of coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man. The charges against Weatherhogg involve arranging sexual encounters for the woman through an adult website and sending explicit material to the victim's sister, but it doesn't mention \"blackmailing a woman\" or \"sexual activity with her boyfriend.\"\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Clive Weatherhogg was convicted of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity with her boyfriend.\n2. The summary states that Weatherhogg was convicted of attempting to blackmail the woman.\n\nBased on these two points, it appears that there is a discrepancy between the article and the summary. The article does not mention blackmail, while the summary does.\n\n3. The article does mention that Weatherhogg sent a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day, which could be interpreted as a form of blackmail.\n4. However, the article does not explicitly state that Weatherhogg attempted to blackmail the woman.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While the article does mention some of the same information as the summary, it does not use the same language or emphasize the same points. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
