The article states that the fan trouble occurred after Raja's 2-1 victory over Chabab Rif Al Hoceima, and that the fans threw flares and ripped up parts of the Mohammed V stadium.\n2. The summary does not mention anything about the game or the stadium, and instead states that the football club has been fined \u00a37,000.\n3. The article does not mention anything about the club being fined. Instead, it states that the DGSN security service arrested 31 people for \"acts of vandalism\" and that prosecutors have opened an inquiry into the fan trouble.\n4.
