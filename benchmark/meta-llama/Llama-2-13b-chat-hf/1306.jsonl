The article states that the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit, and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.

The article states that the total cost of the project is \u00a333m, and that the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The summary does not mention the cost of the project.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article.
