Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt.
