Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Tesco is selling its Fresh & Easy chain to Yucaipa, a private equity company.\n2. The summary does not mention anything about Tesco selling its Fresh & Easy chain. Instead, it simply repeats the name \"Fresh & Easy\" several times.\n3. The article states that around 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees will transfer to the new business as part of the deal. The summary does not mention anything about employees or their transfer.\n4. The article states that Tesco will loan the new business around \u00a380m. The summary does not mention anything about a loan or financing.\n5. The article states that Fresh & Easy has lost money since opening in 2007. The summary does not mention anything about the financial performance of Fresh & Easy.\n6. The article states that Tesco will pay \u00a3150m to dispose of the Fresh & Easy brand, but part of that is a loan which may be paid back. The summary does not mention anything about the cost of disposing of the brand or any potential repayment of the loan.\n7. The article states that Yucaipa is a Los Angeles-based private equity company focused on supermarket and restaurant businesses, and that it is run by billionaire investor Ron Burkle. The summary does not mention anything about Yucaipa or its ownership structure.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide any information about the key points of the article, such as the sale of Fresh & Easy, the transfer of employees, the financing of the new business, or the financial performance of Fresh & Easy. Instead, the summary simply repeats the name \"Fresh & Easy\" several times. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
