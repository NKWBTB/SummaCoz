However, the article does not mention that the millionaire accused of murdering his wife made any statement at a murder trial. In fact, the article discusses the circumstances of Barry Pring's death, his wife Ganna Ziuzina's actions after his death, and the coroner's verdict regarding his death. There is no mention of a murder trial in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies that there is an ongoing murder trial and that the accused millionaire made a specific statement in the trial.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Barry Pring was killed in a hit and run accident in Kiev in 2008.\n2. The coroner at Exeter County Hall, Dr Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, stating that Barry's guard was lowered by inebriation and the car that hit him had stolen license plates and did not brake or stop.\n3. The article mentions that Ms. Ziuzina, Barry's wife, was 19 years younger than him and tried to claim his assets within days of his death.\n4. The article states that the couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement.\n5. The article mentions that Ms. Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat, and moved funds from his bank account.\n6. The article states that the Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death in 2011, but relaunched it as a murder inquiry.\n\nBased on these points, here is my conclusion:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a murder trial, but the article does not mention any trial or criminal charges against Ms. Ziuzina. Instead, the article focuses on the inquest into Barry's death and the coroner's verdict of unlawful killing. Additionally, the summary does not mention any of the details about the couple's background or the circumstances of Barry's death that are included in the article."}
