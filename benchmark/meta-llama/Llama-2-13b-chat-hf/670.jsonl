The summary implies that a lollipop lady was hit on the head by a lollipop lady as he walked her home from school.\n2. However, the article states that Sylvia Blackburn, a lollipop lady, was hit by a car driven by Brian Wright, resulting in serious head injuries. The article does not mention another lollipop lady hitting her on the head.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces an inaccurate and confusing statement about two lollipop ladies, which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Sylvia Blackburn, a 72-year-old lollipop lady, was hit on the head by a car while she was escorting a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road.\n2. The summary does not mention that Sylvia Blackburn was a lollipop lady, nor does it mention that she was hit on the head. Instead, it simply states that a lollipop lady was hit by a car.\n3. The article states that the driver, Brian Wright, is accused of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The summary does not mention any charges or allegations against the driver.\n4. The article mentions that Sylvia Blackburn is now being treated in residential care, which suggests that she was seriously injured in the incident. The summary does not mention her current condition or any details about her injuries.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately convey the details of the incident as reported in the article, and it does not provide the same level of information about the accused driver or the victim. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
