The summary implies that James Haskell's Instagram photo dressed as Iron Man is the main focus of the article. However, the article primarily discusses James Haskell's rugby career and his return to Wasps in 2012, with a brief mention of his Instagram post at the beginning.\n2. The article states that James Haskell posted the Iron Man photo on Instagram and briefly mentions the premiere of the Avengers: Age of Ultron movie but does not provide extensive details about the movie premiere or the A-list cast.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary focuses on the Instagram post and the movie premiere, while the article is primarily about James Haskell's rugby career and return to Wasps.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions that James Haskell posted an Instagram photo dressed as Robert Downey Jr.'s character Iron Man. The article does not mention anything about Haskell posting an Instagram photo.\n2. The summary states that the highly-anticipated movie premiered at Westfield London shopping centre on Tuesday evening. The article does not mention the specific location or date of the movie premiere.\n3. The summary mentions that fans queued up to see the A-list cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson. The article does not mention the cast or the queues of fans.\n4. The summary states that Haskell returned to Wasps for the 2012 season after spells with Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams, and Glasgow. The article does not mention Haskell's return to Wasps or his spells with other teams.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary includes information that is not present in the article, such as Haskell's Instagram post and the movie premiere location, and omits information that is present in the article, such as Haskell's return to Wasps and his spells with other teams. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
