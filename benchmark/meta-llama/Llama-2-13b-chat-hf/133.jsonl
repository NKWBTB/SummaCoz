The summary implies that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday, and the tower itself did not have significant damage, and the fire was halted around midnight.\n2. However, the article states that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday in the bell tower, specifically in the wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower as it undergoes restoration. The article mentions that the emergencies ministry for Moscow reported the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, and the fire's spread had been halted around midnight. The summary incorrectly mentions that the blaze broke out at the convent and in wooden scaffolding without specifying the bell tower. This creates a factual inconsistency.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary does not specify that the blaze occurred in the bell tower of the Novodevichy Convent and incorrectly attributes the lack of significant damage to the entire convent, not just the tower.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the blaze broke out in the wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower, while the summary states that the blaze broke out at the convent. This is inconsistent, as the article specifically mentions the tower as the location of the fire.\n2. The article states that the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, while the summary does not mention this detail. This is inconsistent, as the article provides important information about the condition of the tower after the fire.\n3. The article mentions that the fire was halted around midnight, while the summary does not mention this detail. This is inconsistent, as the article provides a specific time frame for when the fire was halted.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary omits important details from the article, such as the location of the fire and the condition of the tower after the fire, and includes inaccurate information, such as the statement that the blaze broke out at the convent instead of the tower. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
