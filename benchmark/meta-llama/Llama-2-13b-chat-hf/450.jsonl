The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that St Mirren has signed striker Jeremy Clarkson on a season-long loan from Dundee.\n2. However, the article does not mention any transfer of Jeremy Clarkson to St Mirren. Instead, the article discusses a player named Clarkson (without specifying the first name) who joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship. The player in question appears to be a footballer, not the well-known TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary assumes Jeremy Clarkson, the TV presenter, has been signed by St Mirren, while the article discusses a different individual who is a footballer.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Clarkson joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July, but the summary only mentions that he signed for St Mirren on a season-long loan. This information is not consistent, as the article does not mention a loan deal.\n2. The article states that Clarkson has featured mainly as a substitute this term, but the summary does not mention this information. This suggests that the summary may not be providing a complete picture of Clarkson's situation.\n3. The article mentions that Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level, but the summary does not include this information. This suggests that the summary may not be providing a complete picture of Clarkson's experience and background.\n4. The article mentions that St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa, but the summary does not include this information. This suggests that the summary may not be providing a complete picture of the team's current situation.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary does not provide a complete picture of Clarkson's situation or the team's current situation, and it omits important information such as Clarkson's experience and the team's position in the league. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
