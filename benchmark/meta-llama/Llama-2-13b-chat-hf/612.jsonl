The summary states that Barcelona has rejected a bid from Barcelona to sign Neymar from Barcelona for an unspecified amount.\n2. However, the article does not mention Barcelona rejecting a bid to sign Neymar from themselves. Instead, the article is about Neymar's transfer from Santos to Barcelona for a fee of \u00a348.6 million. It discusses the tax-related issues surrounding the transfer and the total cost of acquiring Neymar. The article does not mention Barcelona receiving a bid from themselves.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that Barcelona rejected a bid from themselves to sign Neymar from themselves. The article is primarily about Neymar's transfer from another club to Barcelona and the related financial and legal matters.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Barcelona paid \u00a348.6m for Neymar, and the summary does not mention any bid from Barcelona to sign Neymar. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article on this point.\n2. The article mentions that Neymar's parents received \u00a334m of the fee, but the summary does not mention this. This is another inconsistency between the two.\n3. The article states that the total cost of Neymar to Barcelona will be \u00a3106.8m, taking into account signing-on fees, wages, agents' fees, and tax payments. The summary does not mention any of these additional costs.\n4. The article mentions that Sandro Rosell resigned as Barcelona president following accusations of misappropriation of money, and that he is being investigated but denies any wrongdoing. The summary does not mention any of this.\n5. The article states that a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide accurate information about the transfer of Neymar to Barcelona, and omits several key details mentioned in the article. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
