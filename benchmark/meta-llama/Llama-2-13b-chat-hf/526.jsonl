The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that Newport Gwent Dragons will not be given a contract before the end of the season, as stated by the rugby football league (Foxall).\n2. However, the article does not mention any statement from the rugby football league or its CEO (Foxall) regarding Newport Gwent Dragons or the issuance of a contract.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which attributes a statement to the rugby football league CEO without supporting evidence in the article. The article primarily discusses Newport County's lease and potential impact from the Welsh Rugby Union's takeover bid, but it does not reference the rugby football league CEO or the specific statement mentioned in the summary.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has made a takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, and that the bid will be put to a vote on May 9th.\n2. The article also states that Newport County, who currently play at Rodney Parade, have a lease to use the ground until 2023 and have primacy of fixtures on the venue if they remain in the Football League.\n3. The article quotes Newport County chairman Mike Foxall as saying that the club has a contract to use the ground until 2023 and that they expect the contract to be honored.\n4. The summary states that Newport Gwent Dragons will not be given a contract before the end of the season.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about Newport Gwent Dragons not being given a contract before the end of the season. Instead, the article focuses on the WRU's takeover bid for the Dragons and the impact it could have on Newport County's use of Rodney Parade.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \"no\". The summary is not consistent with the article."}
