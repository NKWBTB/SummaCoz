Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Wedgwood Museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire is not in London.\n2. The summary mentions that the museum is in London, which is inconsistent with the article.\n3. The article explains that the museum was facing auction due to pension debt, but a public fundraising campaign saved the collection and it will remain on display at the museum.\n4. The summary does not mention the reason for the museum being at risk or the fundraising campaign that saved it.\n\nTherefore, based on the inconsistencies above, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it mislocates the museum and omits important details about the fundraising campaign. The answer is therefore \"no\"."}
