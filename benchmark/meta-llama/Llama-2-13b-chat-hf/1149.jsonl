Instead, the arcile states that the woman was the fourth of five cyclists to die in London in nine days.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Venera Minakhmetova died after being struck by a lorry in central London.\n2. The summary does not mention the location of the incident, only referring to \"lorry in central London.\"\n3. The article states that Ms. Minakhmetova was the fourth of five cyclists to die in London in nine days, and that there have been 13 cyclist deaths in London this year, with eight of those involving HGVs.\n4. The summary does not mention the number of cyclist deaths or the involvement of HGVs.\n5. The article quotes Ms. Minakhmetova's sister, Dina, who thanked people for their support following her sister's death and urged anyone with information to come forward.\n6. The summary does not mention any quotes or statements from Ms. Minakhmetova's family or loved ones.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only provides a brief and incomplete summary of the article's content, omitting important details such as the location of the incident, the number of cyclist deaths, and the quotes from Ms. Minakhmetova's sister. Therefore, the answer is no."}
