{"filename": "val_reranking.json", "label": 0, "document": "(CNN)Spirit Airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes. The low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $69 round-trip fares in April and May that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply. Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act. \"We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,\" reads the offer on Spirit's website. \"It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.\" Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. \"You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked,\" wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis. Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture. \"Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. We enjoy being different than other airlines,\" said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications. \"When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.  But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. They get lots of attention,\" he added. \"The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently.\" The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday. Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights. Based in Florida, Spirit Airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can. The airline's defense is simple: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want. Airline plans $15 flights to Europe .", "claim": "spirit airlines has a new fare deal with sex jokes. the low-cost carrier is celebrating $ 69 round-trip fares in april. some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and crossed the limits of good taste. round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $ 34.50.", "cnndm_id": "f237c468e2e9cb25a09c59b8743a066890b6c6eb", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Spirit Airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes.", "The low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $69 round-trip fares in April and May that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply.", "Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight.", "But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act.", "\"We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,\" reads the offer on Spirit's website.", "\"It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles).", "Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.\"", "Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste.", "\"You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked,\" wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis.", "Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture.", "\"Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be.", "We enjoy being different than other airlines,\" said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications.", "\"When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.", " But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent.", "They get lots of attention,\" he added.", "\"The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are.", "We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently.\"", "The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday.", "Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights.", "Based in Florida, Spirit Airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can.", "The airline's defense is simple: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want.", "Airline plans $15 flights to Europe ."], "sum_sents": ["spirit airlines has a new fare deal with sex jokes.", "the low-cost carrier is celebrating $ 69 round-trip fares in april.", "some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and crossed the limits of good taste.", "round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $ 34.50."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 2, 7, 19], "cot": "1.

The summary mentions spirit airlines has a new fare deal with sex jokes, but the fact in article isSpirit Airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes. The 'with sex jokes' is for 'announcing it with'.\n2. The summary mentions round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $ 34.50, but it missed the information in article that $34.50 is for one-way, without this information, the reader won't know what is $34.50 for.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The summary states that Spirit Airlines has a new fare deal with sex jokes. The article does mention that the airline is using cheeky ad copy to promote its $69 round-trip fares, but it does not explicitly state that the jokes are about sex. Therefore, the summary is not entirely accurate in this regard.\n2. The summary mentions that some observers have criticized the promotion as sophomoric and in poor taste. The article does quote one observer who made this criticism, but it also notes that the promotion has received a lot of attention and that many customers find the ads humorous. Therefore, the summary oversimplifies the mixed reaction to the promotion.\n3. The summary states that round-trip purchase is not required, and that customers could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. This is correct, as the article does mention that round-trip purchase is not required and that customers can purchase one-way tickets for $34.50.\n\nBased on these points, I would say that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While it accurately reports some aspects of the promotion, it oversimplifies other aspects and contains inaccuracies (such as the claim that the jokes are about sex). Therefore, the answer is NO."}
