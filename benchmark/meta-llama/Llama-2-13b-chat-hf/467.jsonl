The summary implies that an investigation has been launched into the cause of a fire at a recycling site in Greater Manchester.\n2. However, the article does not explicitly state that an investigation into the cause of the fire has been launched. It provides information about the fire incident, the suspension of Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste, and actions taken by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service and the Environment Agency. It also mentions that the cause of the fire remains undetermined. While these details are related to the fire, the article does not confirm the launch of an investigation into its cause.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire. This suggests that the EA took action against the company due to the fire.\n2. The article also states that the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit for the site, effective August 7th, if the company does not appeal the decision. This indicates that the EA has taken enforcement action against the company.\n3. The article mentions that the fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport, and the environment. This suggests that the fire service and the EA have been working together to address the issues at the site.\n4. The article states that the company, Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, was \"broadly compliant\" with fire safety law, according to the fire service. This suggests that the company was not in complete violation of fire safety regulations.\n\nBased on these points, here is my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions an investigation into the cause of the fire, but the article provides more information about the actions taken by the Environment Agency (EA) and the fire service. The article mentions that the EA suspended the company from accepting waste and is revoking their environmental permit, which suggests that the company has been found to be non-compliant with regulations. Additionally, the article mentions that the fire service raised concerns to the EA in February, which is not mentioned in the summary."}
