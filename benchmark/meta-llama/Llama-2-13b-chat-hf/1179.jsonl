Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Jak Trueman, a 15-year-old boy from Scotland, died in hospital after a long battle with gamma delta T-cell lymphoma.\n2. The summary only mentions that the family of the teenager has paid tribute to him, without providing any details about his illness or death.\n3. The article provides specific details about Jak's life, including his love of Rangers FC, his meetings with former football players, and his positive attitude despite his illness.\n4. The summary does not mention any of these details, and only mentions the teenager's death in a very general way.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides much more information about Jak's life and death, while the summary only mentions the family's tribute to him. Therefore, I would answer \"no\" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
