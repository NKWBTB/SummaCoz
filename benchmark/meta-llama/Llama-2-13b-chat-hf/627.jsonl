Instead, the article discusses the circumstances of Barry Pring's death, the coroner's verdict, and the suspicions regarding his wife's involvement. There is no information about a Ukrainian millionaire being cleared of the crime.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies an entirely different outcome of the case (being cleared) compared to the article, which focuses on the coroner's findings regarding the death and suspicions but doesn't mention any clearance of a Ukrainian millionaire.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Barry Pring was killed by a speeding car while trying to hail a taxi on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway in Kiev in 2008.\n2. The coroner at Exeter County Hall, Dr Elizabeth Earland, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, stating that Barry's guard was lowered by inebriation and the car had stolen licence plates and did not brake or stop.\n3. The article mentions that Ms. Ziuzina, Barry's wife, was 19 years younger than him and tried to claim his assets within days of his death.\n4. The article states that the couple met online in 2006 and were married in 2007 following a four-day engagement.\n5. The inquest heard that Ms. Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat, and moved funds from his bank account.\n6. The article mentions that Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said \"strenuous attempts\" had been made to get Ms. Ziuzina to attend the inquest, but without success.\n7. The article states that Ms. Ziuzina made \"three separate statements to Ukrainian police\" and did not believe she could \"add anything further\".\n8. The article mentions that witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing \"as a deliberate act\".\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the article is not consistent with the summary. The summary states that a Ukrainian millionaire has been cleared of killing his wife, but the article states that the coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and that the case is still active as a murder inquiry. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
