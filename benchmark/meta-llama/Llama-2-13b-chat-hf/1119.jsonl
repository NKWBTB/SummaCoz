Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the race was held in Lithuania, but the summary does not mention this detail.\n2. The article states that the race was a 380-meter course with obstacles such as haystacks, a steep slope, and water pistols, but the summary does not mention any of these details.\n3. The article mentions that the race was open to all combinations of competitors, including men carrying women, men carrying men, and one woman carrying a woman, but the summary only mentions \"a pair of paralympian pistols\" setting up a marathon.\n4. The article states that the winners, Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna, will compete at the World Championships in Finland in July, but the summary does not mention this detail.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not accurately convey the details of the race or the participants, and it does not mention the World Championships in Finland. Therefore, the answer is no."}
