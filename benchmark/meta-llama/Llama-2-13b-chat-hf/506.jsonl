Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that the event took place in Nottwil, Switzerland, but the summary states that the event was held in London. This is a contradiction, as London is not mentioned in the article.\n2. The article mentions that the event was the track cycling world championships, but the summary only mentions the 100m title. This is an inconsistency, as the article does not mention the 100m event.\n3. The article states that Storey won the event by more than two minutes, but the summary does not mention the margin of victory.\n4. The article mentions that Storey is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, but the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains inaccuracies and omissions that are not supported by the information in the article. Therefore, the answer is no."}
