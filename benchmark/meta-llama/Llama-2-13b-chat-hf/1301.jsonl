The summary states that Manchester City have been given a one-match touchline ban, but the article does not mention anything about a touchline ban. Instead, the article states that two players (Aguero and Fernandinho) have been given suspensions, and the club has been charged with violent conduct. The summary does not accurately reflect all of the information in the article."}
