The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that the police investigating the murders of two British tourists on the Thai island of kodge are to travel to Thailand.\n2. However, the article does not mention the island of kodge. Instead, the articles mention the bodies were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao.\n3. The article also states that the police have already traveled to Thailand and have completed their work.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the bodies of two British tourists, David Miller and Hannah Witheridge, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on September 15.\n2. The Metropolitan Police have sent officers to Thailand to work with Thai police on the investigation.\n3. The UK detectives have completed their work in Thailand and will now return to the UK to compile their report and update the families of the victims.\n4. Two Burmese suspects, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape, and robbery.\n5. The UK Foreign Office has expressed concerns about the police investigation, specifically regarding the verification of DNA samples and allegations of mistreatment.\n\nNow, let's compare the summary to the article:\n\n1. The summary mentions that the police are investigating the murders of two British tourists on the Thai island of Koh Tao. This is consistent with the article.\n2. The summary does not mention the names of the victims or the dates of the discoveries, which are included in the article.\n3. The summary does not mention the involvement of Metropolitan Police officers or the fact that the UK detectives have completed their work in Thailand.\n4. The summary does not mention the charges against the suspects or the concerns expressed by the UK Foreign Office.\n\nBased on the above comparison, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides only a brief and general overview of the investigation, while the article provides more detailed information about the case, including the names of the victims, the dates of the discoveries, the involvement of Metropolitan Police officers, and the concerns expressed by the UK Foreign Office."}
