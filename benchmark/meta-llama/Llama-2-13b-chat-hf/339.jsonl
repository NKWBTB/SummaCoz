The summary only mentions that it was a \"swarm day\" for the team, without any mention of danger or any specific events that occurred.\n3. The article describes the Asian carp emerging from the water and attacking the team's boat, with one fish flopping on a team member's legs.\n4. The summary does not mention any of these details, and instead only refers to it being a \"swarm day\" for the team.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides specific details about the team's experience with Asian carp, while the summary only provides a vague and general description of the day.
