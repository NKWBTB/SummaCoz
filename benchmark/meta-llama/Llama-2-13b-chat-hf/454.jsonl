The summary states that the new owners of Bernard Matthews have said they believe a new pension scheme will be changed.\n2. However, the article does not mention any intention or need to change the pension scheme. In fact, the article emphasizes that the new owner, Ranjit Boparan, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies that there will be changes to the pension scheme under the new ownership, while the article explicitly states that the current pension arrangements will be honored and continued without any changes.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the new owners, Ranjit Boparan, have given guarantees that all current agreements, including the pension scheme, will be honored.\n2. The article also mentions that the existing pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that current employees have an alternative pension scheme that is unaffected by the takeover.\n3. The summary states that the new owners are \"confident\" a new pension scheme will be introduced.\n\nBased on the information in the article, it appears that the new owners are not planning to change the existing pension scheme, but rather to continue with the current arrangements. The word \"confident\" in the summary could be interpreted as a statement of intent to introduce a new pension scheme in the future, but there is no indication in the article that this is the case.\n\nTherefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not mention any plans to change the pension scheme, while the summary suggests that such changes may be forthcoming.\n\nSo, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
