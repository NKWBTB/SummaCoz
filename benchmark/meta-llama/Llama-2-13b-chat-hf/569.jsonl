The summary states that a 23-year-old man has died after a shooting outside a house in Sheffield.\n2. However, the article provides different information. It mentions that the victim was fatally injured outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, Sheffield, but it does not specify the age of the victim. The article provides details about the location of the incident, the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and other incidents in Sheffield but does not mention the victim's age.\n3. The inconsistency arises from the error in the summary, which inaccurately states the age of the victim as 23 years old and specifies that the shooting occurred outside a house, while the article provides a more general description of the location without mentioning the victim's age.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the victim was fatally injured outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, close to the city centre.\n2. The summary only mentions that the shooting took place in Sheffield, without providing a specific location.\n3. The article states that the victim was found with a gunshot wound to his chest, and that he was taken to Northern General hospital but died from his injuries.\n4. The summary does not mention the victim's injuries or their fatality.\n5. The article mentions that there have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, but the summary does not provide any context or information about previous incidents.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide enough information to accurately convey the details of the article, and it omits important information such as the victim's injuries and fatality. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
