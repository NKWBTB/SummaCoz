The summary does not mention the gender of the baby or the date of birth.\n3. The article states that Ms. Jones was concerned about her fertility after filming a documentary, but the summary does not mention anything about fertility or a documentary.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
