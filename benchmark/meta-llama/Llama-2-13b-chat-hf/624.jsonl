Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that four out of five children in England who eat school lunches have tried food at school that they have not tried at home. This suggests that school lunches are exposing children to a variety of new foods that they may not have tried before.\n2. The article also states that half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. This suggests that children are not only trying new foods at school, but they are also requesting these foods at home.\n3. The summary states that parents who eat lunches at school are more likely to eat a meal than their children. This is not supported by the article, as the article does not mention anything about parents eating school lunches.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article focuses on the variety of foods that children are exposed to at school, while the summary makes a claim about parents and their eating habits."}
