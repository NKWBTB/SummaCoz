{"document": "However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation.\nIn 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.\nA further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.\nThese events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.\nRancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.\nIn September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.\nIn 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.\nFiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.\nThe two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.\nMixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.\nThere are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.\nAlthough the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing.\nNonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.", "claim": "fiji, fiji, fiji, fiji and fiji have been one of the country\\'s best-known economies since the 2011 coup.", "bbcid": "14919066", "model_name": "TranS2S", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "doc_sents": ["However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation.", "\nIn 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition.", "This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.", "\nA further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.", "\nThese events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.", "\nRancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it.", "The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.", "\nIn September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy.", "It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.", "\nIn 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties.", "Following the elections the Commonwealth re", "-instated Fiji as a member.", "\nFiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.", "\nThe two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee.", "Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.", "\nMixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.", "\nThere are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.", "\nAlthough the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse.", "Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing.", "\nNonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid."], "sum_sents": ["fiji, fiji, fiji, fiji and fiji have been one of the country\\'s best-known economies since the 2011 coup."], "rel_index": [0, 3, 4, 19], "extra": "[\n  \"country\\\\'s best-known economies since the 2011 coup\"\n]", "cot": "1.

The summary mentions Fiji as one of the country's best-known economies since the 2011 coup, implying that Fiji's economy has been consistently strong and stable.

However, the article states nothing about the 2011 coup.\n3.

Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Fiji has been experiencing political instability and international isolation since 1987, with several coups taking place in that time period.\n2. The article mentions that the 2000 coup, led by George Speight, caused great harm to the economy, particularly the tourism industry.\n3. The article states that Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth in 2009 due to its lack of progress towards democracy.\n4. The article mentions that the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, which led to the re-instatement of Fiji as a member of the Commonwealth.\n5. The article states that the population of Fiji is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, with indigenous Fijians making up a small overall majority.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions \"Fiji\" four times, while the article provides a detailed overview of Fiji's political and economic history, including the impact of coups and international isolation on the country's economy. The summary does not provide any information about the country's political instability, international isolation, or the impact of coups on the economy. Additionally, the summary does not mention the population divide between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, or the country's reliance on sugar and tourism industries for foreign exchange. Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
