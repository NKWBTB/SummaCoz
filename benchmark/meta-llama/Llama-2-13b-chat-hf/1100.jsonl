Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article mentions that Dan Groves said the \"finer points\" of a deal which could see Wright buy 20% of the club are yet to be released. This suggests that there is a deal in place for Wright to buy a significant stake in the club, but the details have not been fully disclosed.\n2. The summary states that Crawley Town have signed right-back Glenn Groves from non-league side Leway Town. This is not mentioned in the article at all.\n3. The article does mention that Billericay have recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, but there is no mention of Glenn Groves or any transfer dealings.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions a player named Glenn Groves joining Crawley Town, but there is no such player mentioned in the article. Additionally, the article focuses on Billericay and their takeover by Glenn Tamplin, while the summary mentions Crawley Town.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
