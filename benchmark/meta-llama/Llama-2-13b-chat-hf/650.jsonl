The summary states that National League side Torquay United has signed striker Myles Anderson on a two-year contract after he was released by the National League club.\n2. However, the article states that Centre-back Anderson has canceled his Barrow contract by mutual consent and is joining their National League rivals. The article does not mention any signing of Myles Anderson by Torquay United on a two-year contract. Instead, it discusses the departure of Centre-back Anderson from Barrow.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies that Torquay United signed Myles Anderson after his release, whereas the article provides information about another player, Centre-back Anderson, who canceled his contract with Barrow.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Anderson has cancelled his contract with Barrow by mutual consent to join Torquay United.\n2. The summary only mentions that Anderson has signed a two-year contract with Torquay United, without mentioning that he left Barrow by mutual consent.\n3. The article also mentions that Anderson has played for other clubs in the past, including Aldershot and Exeter, and that he has also played in Italy.\n4. The summary does not mention any of these details.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include all of the information provided in the article. Specifically, it does not mention that Anderson left Barrow by mutual consent, and it does not provide any details about his past clubs or international experience.\n\nTherefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
