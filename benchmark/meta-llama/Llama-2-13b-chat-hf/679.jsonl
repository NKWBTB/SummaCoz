The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, the area being searched in Dublin, the involvement of the Irish police (Garda\u00ed), and the release of CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.\n3.

The summary does not mention the month or date when Trevor Deely was last seen.\n3. The article mentions that a search is under way for Trevor Deely, and that it is expected to take a number of weeks.\n4. The summary does not mention any search or investigation.\n5. The article mentions that detectives have been conducting a complete review of Trevor Deely's disappearance, and that they have enhanced CCTV footage from the night he went missing.\n6. The summary does not mention any investigation or CCTV footage.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not provide any information about the investigation or search for Trevor Deely, while the article provides detailed information about these aspects of the case. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
