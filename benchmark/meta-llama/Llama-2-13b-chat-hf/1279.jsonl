Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that the Lib Dems and Labour have teamed up to inflict defeats on the government regarding the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.\n2. The article also mentions that the two parties have a track record of forming alliances to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.\n3. However, the article states that the Lib Dems are determined to insist on their amendments, despite MPs rejecting them, and that Labour is prepared to defer to the Commons.\n4. A Labour source in the Lords is quoted as saying that the Lib Dems' actions are \"fairly obvious grandstanding\" and that they are building up false hope with people.\n5. The article concludes by stating that the two parties have a history of forming alliances, but that there may be \"residual tensions\" due to the Lib Dems' rejection of Labour's calls to set up a Brexit deal with the EU.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the Lib Dems have rejected calls to set up a Brexit deal with the EU, but the article does not mention this. Instead, it highlights the cooperation between the two parties in the past and the current tensions between them. Therefore, the answer is no. The summary is not consistent with the article."}
