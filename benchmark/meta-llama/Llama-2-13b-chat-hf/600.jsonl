The summary does not mention anything about Vincent Barker's death or the trial of Honey Rose. Instead, it mentions a man accused of murdering Vincent Barker 30 years ago.\n3. The article states that the prosecution alleges that Vinnie's death was preventable and that Ms. Rose's conduct was so far below the expected standard that it was criminal.\n4. The summary does not mention anything about the preventability of Vinnie's death or Ms. Rose's conduct.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
