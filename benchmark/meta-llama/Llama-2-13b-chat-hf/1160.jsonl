The article states that Wanda Campbell was found guilty of acting with others to take money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013.\n2. The article also states that Campbell was jailed for three years and ordered to pay compensation of \u00a3110,000.\n3. The summary states that the woman was jailed for three years for conspiring to steal more than \u00a3110,000 from a Dumfries castle.\n\nBased on these points, here's my answer:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the woman was jailed for conspiring to steal money, but the article does not use the word \"conspiring.\" Instead, it states that Campbell was found guilty of acting with others to take money. Additionally, the article does not mention the amount of money that was taken, while the summary states that it was more than \u00a3110,000."}
