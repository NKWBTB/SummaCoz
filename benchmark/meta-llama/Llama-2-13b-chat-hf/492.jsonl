The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has expressed surprise about his party's election victory.\n2. However, the article does not mention any election victory for Mike Nesbitt or his party, nor does it provide any information about an election victory.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that Mike Nesbitt has won an election and is surprised by it, while the article discusses his comments and positions but does not mention an election victory.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf": "  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The article states that Mike Nesbitt, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, made a speech at the launch of his party's manifesto, in which he said that \"Domination doesn't work, partnership does.\"\n2. The article also reports that Nesbitt's comments have turned the focus onto the Ulster Unionists, particularly after one of his senior party colleagues, Danny Kennedy, publicly distanced himself from Nesbitt's remarks.\n3. In response to journalists' questions, Nesbitt denied having any regrets or making a mistake, and reiterated his call for voters to support the Ulster Unionists and any candidate they believe will do the right thing.\n4. The article highlights that Nesbitt spent time knocking on doors in heavily unionist areas and received little criticism, which he takes as a sign of confidence in his position.\n5. The manifesto, entitled 'Real Partnership', includes calls for action in various areas, such as tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers, and prioritizing the York Street interchange.\n\nNow, based on the information provided in the article, here's my answer to the question:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Nesbitt was \"surprised\" by the response to his party's election victory, but the article does not mention any such surprise or reaction from Nesbitt. Instead, the article focuses on Nesbitt's comments about partnership and the response to those comments, as well as the Ulster Unionists' manifesto and their calls for action. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article."}
