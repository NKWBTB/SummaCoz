The article states that the fire's spread was halted around midnight, but the summary does not mention this detail.\n\nBased on these differences, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not include all the information provided in the article, and it does not accurately convey the details of the fire and the convent's status. Therefore, the answer is no.
