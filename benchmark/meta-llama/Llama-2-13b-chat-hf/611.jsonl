It provides details about the transfer, including the amounts paid and the tax-related issues surrounding the transfer. It does not mention Barcelona trying to sign Neymar from themselves.\n3.

This information is not mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the total cost of Neymar to Barcelona, the investigation into the transfer, or the complimentary tax declaration made by the club. Therefore, the answer is NO."}
