{"document": "There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity\u00a0in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium.
