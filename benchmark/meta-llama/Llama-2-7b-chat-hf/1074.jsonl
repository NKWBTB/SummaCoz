Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"ayr united\" while the article uses \"Pars\" to refer to the home team. This is consistent, as the article explicitly states that the match was between Pars and Ayr United.\n2. The summary mentions \"two late goals\" while the article mentions \"two quick fire goals\" in the first half. This is consistent, as the article does mention two goals scored by Ayr United in the first half, and the summary accurately summarizes this information.\n3. The summary does not mention any details about the goals scored by Ayr United, but the article provides specific information about the goals, including the scorers and the method of each goal. This is consistent, as the article provides more detailed information about the goals than the summary does.\n4. The summary does not mention any information about the second half of the match, but the article does mention a late chance saved by the Pars goalkeeper. This is consistent, as the article provides more information about the second half of the match than the summary does.\n\nBased on these comparisons, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
