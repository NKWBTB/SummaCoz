The summary states that one of the world's biggest physicists has warned that artificial intelligence could be used in humans.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about AI being used in humans. Instead, it talks about the potential risks and benefits of AI, and how OpenAI aims to advance digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity.\n3. The article quotes Stephen Hawking as saying that AI could potentially \"re-design itself at an ever increasing rate\", but this is not the same as saying that AI will be used in humans.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"one of the world's biggest physicists\" warning about AI being used against humans, which is supported by the article as it quotes Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking as warning about the potential dangers of AI.\n2. The summary mentions AI being used in a way that could threaten humanity, which is also supported by the article as it quotes Musk as saying that AI is humanity's \"biggest existential threat\" and Hawking as warning that AI could potentially \"re-design itself at an ever increasing rate\" and supersede humans.\n3. The summary mentions the venture's goal of advancing digital intelligence in a way that benefits humanity, which is supported by the article as it quotes OpenAI's statement saying that the venture aims \"to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\"\n4. The summary mentions the tiny fraction of the $1 billion pledged that will be spent in the next few years, which is supported by the article as it mentions that only a small fraction of the $1 billion pledged will be spent in the next few years.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article as it accurately represents the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is (yes)."}
