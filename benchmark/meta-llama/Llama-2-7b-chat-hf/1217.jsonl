The summary mentions the location of the incident, Kilkee, which is consistent with the article's mention of the \"Marian estate in Kilkee.\"\n3. The summary mentions the charge against the accused, Robbie Walsh, which is consistent with the article's mention of \"assault causing serious harm\" and the accused's remand in custody.\n4. The summary mentions the involvement of multiple individuals in the fight, which is consistent with the article's mention of \"other individuals\" arriving at the scene and becoming involved in the fight.\n5. The summary mentions the recovery of weapons, including a knife handle and blade, which is consistent with the article's mention of \"knives and golf clubs\" being recovered at the scene.\n6. The summary mentions the time of the incident, early hours of Sunday, which is consistent with the article's mention of \"01:00 on Sunday.\"\n7. The summary mentions the outcome of the incident, the death of Karl Haugh, which is consistent with the article's mention of \"Mr Haugh was brought by ambulance to Limerick University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 06:00 local time.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
