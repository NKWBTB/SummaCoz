The summary mentions a new pension scheme to restore Bernard Matthews' chicken and chicken with guarantees from the Unite union.\n2. However, the article does not provide any information about a new pension scheme related to chicken restoration. It focuses on the continuity of existing pension arrangements and the new owner's plans to make the business more profitable through investments and cost savings.\n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"a new pension scheme to restore Bernard Matthews's chicken and chicken has been given guarantees by the Unite union.\"\n2. In the article, Unite regional officer Steve Harley is quoted as saying, \"We had productive talks and we were given guarantees that all current agreements will be honoured.\" This suggests that the Unite union was involved in negotiations with the new owners and secured guarantees for the existing workers' pension scheme.\n3. The article also states that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004, and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected by the takeover. This is consistent with the summary's mention of a \"new pension scheme\" being introduced.\n4. The Boparan Private Office, the \"chicken king\" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed in the article that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary accurately reflects the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is (yes) the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
