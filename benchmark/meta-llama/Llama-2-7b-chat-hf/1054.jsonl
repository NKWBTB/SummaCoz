Here's why:\n\n1.

The article explains that the ACT test was due to be held at 56 test centers in both South Korea and Hong Kong on Saturday morning, which is consistent with the summary's statement that the test was taken in South Korea.\n3. The article mentions that the ACT Inc, an Iowa-based non-profit organization that was operating the test, took the decision after receiving \"credible evidence that test materials intended for administration in these regions have been compromised,\" which is consistent with the summary's statement that the test was cancelled due to compromised materials.\n4. The article also mentions that all students will get a refund but will only be able to resit when the tests are held again in September, which is consistent with the summary's statement that the students will have to wait until Monday to take the test.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
