Here's why:\n\n1. The location of the incident is mentioned in both the article and the summary. In the article, it is stated that the incident occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale in Caithness, while in the summary, it is mentioned that the incident occurred on the A9 between Dumfries and Galloway. This is a minor inconsistency, as the article does not specify the exact location of the incident, only that it occurred on the A9 north of Berriedale.\n2. The number of people injured in the crash is consistent in both the article and the summary. In the article, it is stated that several other people received minor injuries in the crash, while in the summary, it is mentioned that a man has died. This inconsistency can be explained by the fact that the summary is focusing on the fatality aspect of the incident, while the article is providing more general information about the crash.\n3. The road closure and diversion information is consistent in both the article and the summary. In the article, it is stated that the road was closed and diversions were put in place via the A897 Helmsdale to Melvich road, while in the summary, it is mentioned that the road was closed and diversions were put in place via the A9. This inconsistency can be explained by the fact that the summary is using more general language to describe the road closure and diversion information.\n4. The statement that police inquiries are ongoing is consistent in both the article and the summary.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
