The summary mentions that plans for a disused power station in Southampton have been given the go-ahead by the government.\n2. However, the article provides information about the plans for the disused Fawley power station and the proposed development but does not mention government approval explicitly.\n3.

The article states that the power station is located on the western shore of Southampton Water, and the summary does the same.\n3. The article mentions the height of the chimney, which is 198 meters, and the summary also provides the same information.\n4. The article highlights the significance of the chimney, stating that it dominates the Solent skyline, and the summary also acknowledges this.\n5. The article mentions the number of miles of cable laid within the power station, which is 1,100 miles, and the summary provides the same information.\n6. The article states that the power station was capable of powering one million homes, and the summary repeats this information.\n7. The article quotes an architect from Fawley Waterside developers, Aldred Drummond, who expresses the company's intention to preserve the chimney, and the summary also includes this quote.\n\nBased on these similarities and consistencies, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article.
