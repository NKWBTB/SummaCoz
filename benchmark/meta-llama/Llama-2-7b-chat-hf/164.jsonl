A fake psychologist was caught running a bogus counselling course after setting her students a series of increasingly bizarre tasks including climbing a tree and riding a bike in the rain. Jacqueline Crane, 52, of of St Austell, Cornwall,\u00a0pretended to be a professor of psychology and claimed she was qualified to train people to become counsellors. She set her students bizarre tasks including scaling trees, cycling in bad weather and taking candlelit baths and would then ask for feedback on how the wacky practices made the students feel, a court was told. But her students - who spent thousands of pounds on her courses - became suspicious because of her increasingly strange ideas and bad spelling. The finally caught her out when a group of her students discovered she had used old exam papers to test them. Crane then invented a fake family and forged doctor notes claiming she was too ill to attend court. Despite her best efforts she was jailed for 18 months at Truro Crown Court after pleading guilty to fraud by making a false representation, perverting the course of justice and benefit fraud. The court heard Crane set up the course in May 2012 and ran it for 18 months, pretending to be a doctor of psychology to con her seven long-term and numerous other short term students out of nearly \u00a38,000. Speaking after the hearing two of her former students have spoken of the damage caused after being hooked by Crane's lies. They said they were reeled in by fake photos of Crane in a university cap on her graduation day. Mother-of-five Jessica Brewster, 35, was one of those sucked in to Crane's fantasy world and spent hundreds of wasted hours trying to improve her future. She said: 'I was a taxi driver for Jacqui and she told me she was going to set up a counselling course, which was something I had always wanted to do. Jessica Brewster (pictured) who was one of the students to be conned by fraudster Jacqueline Crane . 'But from the start there were hints that things weren't what they seemed. 'One of the girls kept pointing out that there were spelling mistakes on these slides and asking where she had got them from. Jacqui didn't like that.' Another of the victims, known only as Jane, said: 'She would set us these exercises. One of them was to ride around on a bike in the rain, which I did on Jess' patio. 'One was to have a candlelit bath. Another was to climb a tree. She asked us to think about how it made us feel.' Ms Brewster said they went on a group outing in Truro where they were set another bizarre task. She said: 'She asked us to go up to random people and start conversations with them. 'It sounds silly but I feel humiliated thinking about it now.' An incident involving fake exam papers finally revealed the truth. The group had got together to go over some past papers and then realised that Crane had just given them one for real. Jane said: 'That's when it all hit home.' Crane has now been jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to fraud at\u00a0Truro Crown Court (pictured) Crane was jailed for 12 months for the fraud against her students and three months each for perverting the course of justice and benefits fraud. They will run consecutively. Judge Simon Carr said: 'The money they had saved up to improve their education has been completely wasted.'
