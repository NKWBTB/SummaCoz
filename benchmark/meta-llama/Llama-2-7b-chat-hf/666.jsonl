The summary implies that a prison official has stated that drones could be used to smuggle drugs into a prison.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. While the article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison, it does not mention a prison official stating that drones could be used for smuggling. The article mentions a former inmate claiming that drones were used but notes that the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which attributes the statement about drones to a prison official while the article does not include such a statement.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"drones could be used to smuggle drugs into a prison,\" which is supported by the article. The article states that the Ministry of Justice has introduced laws that mean people who smuggle packages over prison walls could be jailed for up to two years, and there is no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site.\n2. The summary also mentions \"drugs,\" which is a specific type of contraband that is mentioned in the article as one of the issues with prison security. The article states that the jail is \"notorious\" for being \"flooded\" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis, which are also types of contraband.\n3. The summary does not include any information that is not supported by the article. For example, the article does not mention drones being used to smuggle drugs into the prison, so the summary's mention of this is not consistent with the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
