Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the relocation of the Central Library and the Citizens Advice Bureau, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n2. The article states that the council will work with traders to find a private buyer for the Victorian indoor market, which is consistent with the summary's mention of \"plans to close a library in Truro town centre and move to publicise local street view.\"\n3. The article quotes Councillor Bill Dixon as saying that the authority made tough choices but listened to public comment during a consultation, which is consistent with the summary's statement that the plans have been scrapped.\n4. The article mentions that the Labour-run authority blames \"severe austerity cuts imposed by central government\" for the cuts, which is consistent with the summary's lack of mention of any specific reason for scrapping the plans.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article."}
