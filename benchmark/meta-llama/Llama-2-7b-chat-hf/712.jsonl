The summary implies that Hungary's Foreign Minister, Szijjarto, stated that his country does not want European Union countries to withdraw from the EU.\n2. However, the article does not mention Szijjarto making a statement about Hungary not wanting other EU countries to withdraw from the EU. The article primarily discusses Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and the support from Poland to veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights.\n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions the foreign minister of Hungary, Sziji Szijjarto, who is quoted as saying that Hungary does not want European Union countries to withdraw from the EU. This is consistent with the article, which mentions Szijjarto's statement to Reuters that Hungary should not interfere with \"domestic issues\" and that EU institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues.\n2. The summary mentions the three laws that are the subject of controversy: asylum seekers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and higher education. These are the same three areas of concern mentioned in the article, where the EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and NGOs, and the higher education law that could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University.\n3. The summary mentions the potential consequences of Hungary's actions, including the possibility of EU sanctions. This is consistent with the article, which mentions the pressure from European institutions on Hungary to withdraw the three laws and the possibility of EU sanctions if Hungary does not comply.\n4. The summary does not mention any information that is not supported by the article.\n\nTherefore, the summary is consistent with the article and can be answered with a yes."}
