However, the article states that Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall were decommissioned.

Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions that the decommissioned Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham, and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n2. The article states that bidders had until January 23 to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships, and the summary mentions that three former royal navy frigates could be put up for sale in the future.\n3. The article explains that the government's Disposal Services Authority is handling the sale and wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n4. The article quotes Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, as saying that it's important UK recyclers have the chance to prove themselves in the field but also that she wants at least one of the frigates saved from the scrapyard, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the frigates being put up for sale in the future.\n5. The article provides information about the Type 22 frigate's design and capabilities, including its anti-submarine, anti-surface, and anti-aircraft weapons systems, and its command and control and communication facilities, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on these similarities and consistencies, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
