There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"", "claim": "the local authorities in scotland have \" serious problems \" with the council tax system, a report has found.", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "33811105", "model_name": "BERTS2S", "annotations": [1, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "xsum", "error_type": "EntE", "doc_sents": ["Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this", "linkA", "review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system.", "It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.", "The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.", "Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.", "He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.", "But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.", "Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.", "Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.", "But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated.", "There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.", "He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.", "\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So", "whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.", "\"The", "commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.", "A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".", "He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.", "\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\""], "sum_sents": ["the local authorities in scotland have \" serious problems \" with the council tax system, a report has found."], "rel_index": [3, 10, 13, 16, 17], "cot": "1.

The summary suggests that local authorities in Scotland have encountered significant issues with the council tax system, as described in a report.\n2. However, the article discusses the problems and challenges associated with the council tax system but does not explicitly use the phrase or mention that local authorities in Scotland have \"serious problems\" with the system.\n3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of the specific phrase \"serious problems,\" which is not directly supported by the article. The article conveys issues with the council tax system but doesn't use this exact wording.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"serious problems\" with the council tax system, which is the same language used in the article to describe the issues with the current system.\n2. The summary notes that the council tax has \"built-in problems from day one,\" which is also mentioned in the article as a finding of the review by Prof Kenneth Gibb.\n3. The summary mentions that the commission found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen as a \"good tax\" by academics, which is consistent with the information provided in the article about the review of different systems of local taxation.\n4. The summary notes that a local income tax is generally perceived as fairer, which is also mentioned in the article as one of the findings of the review.\n5. The summary mentions that the commission intends to hold a public consultation before publishing its report, which is consistent with the information in the article about the commission's plans to gather input from the public.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points from the article, including the problems with the current council tax system, the findings of the review by Prof Kenneth Gibb, and the commission's plans for reform. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
