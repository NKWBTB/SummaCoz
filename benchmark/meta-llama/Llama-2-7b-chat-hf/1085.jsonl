The article states that the conference was held to improve the current tracking system, which relies on ground-based radars, and to enable satellites to receive transmissions from aircraft. The summary does not mention these details.\n4. The article mentions that the disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems and that the current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) in Geneva, where representatives from over 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for satellite tracking of planes. The summary also mentions a \"world radiocommunication conference\" in Malaysia.\n\t* Consistency: The article and the summary both mention a conference where the decision was made to dedicate part of the radio spectrum for global flight tracking.\n2. The article explains that the current tracking system relies on ground-based radars, but the new system will use satellites to receive transmissions called ADS-B, which will allow for real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world. The summary does not mention anything about ground-based radars or ADS-B transmissions.\n\t* Consistency: The article provides more details about the current tracking system and the new system, which are both consistent with the information provided in the summary.\n3. The article mentions the disappearance of flight MH370 and how it exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems, including the fact that around 70% of the world's airspace is uncovered. The summary does not mention anything about flight MH370 or the weaknesses in air navigation systems.\n\t* Consistency: The article provides context for the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum for global flight tracking, while the summary does not.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I can confidently say that the summary is consistent with the article."}
