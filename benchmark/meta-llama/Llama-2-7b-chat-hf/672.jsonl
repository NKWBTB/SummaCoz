The summary implies that a lollipop lady has been blinded in a \"world upside down\" after admitting causing the death of a lollipop lady.\n2. However, the article does not mention that anyone has been blinded or that a lollipop lady has admitted causing the death of another lollipop lady. The article primarily discusses an accident involving Brian Wright, who is accused of causing serious injury to Sylvia Blackburn, a lollipop lady, and denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The article does not mention any death or a lollipop lady admitting to causing another lollipop lady's death.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces incorrect information about blindness, a lollipop lady's admission of causing death, and a \"world upside down,\" which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the name of the victim, Sylvia Blackburn, which is consistent with the article.\n2. The summary states that Mrs. Blackburn was a lollipop lady, which is consistent with the article.\n3. The summary mentions that Mrs. Blackburn was struck by a car while escorting a woman and her child across the road, which is consistent with the article.\n4. The summary mentions that the driver of the car, Brian Wright, admitted to hitting Mrs. Blackburn but denied causing serious injury by dangerous driving, which is consistent with the article.\n5. The summary quotes Wright as saying he was blinded by the setting sun, which is consistent with the article.\n6. The summary mentions that the trial continues, which is consistent with the article.\n\nBased on these points, the summary provides a clear and accurate summary of the article.
