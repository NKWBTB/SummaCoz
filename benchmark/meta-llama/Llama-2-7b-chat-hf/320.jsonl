Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the issue of payments to Medicare providers, which is a key aspect of the article. The article specifically highlights the passage of a Medicare reform bill that includes a permanent solution to the \"doc fix\" and a two-year extension of a popular children's health insurance program.\n2. The summary accurately quotes Sen. Ron Wyden as saying that the bill will retire the outdated Medicare reimbursement system. This is consistent with the article, which notes that the bill aims to ensure payments to Medicare providers will keep up with inflation.\n3. The summary mentions the opposition of some conservative senators, including Ted Cruz, who pushed for offsets to the bill's costs. This is consistent with the article, which notes that some senators, including Cruz, balked at the bill's price tag and pushed for amendments to have the costs offset.\n4. The summary does not mention any information that is not supported by the article. For example, the article does not mention any specific details about the bill's cost or how it will be paid for, which are not mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article."}
