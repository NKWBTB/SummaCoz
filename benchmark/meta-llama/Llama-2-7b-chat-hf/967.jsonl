{"document": "(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for \"Barbara,\" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the \"warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited \"three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,\" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. \"For her to go to Mexico,\" Mate said, \"It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from.\" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to \"navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,\" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. \"Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,\" Mate said.

This statement is also incorrect, as the article does not mention anything about the north coast of Mexico being Russian for \"Barbara\".\n3.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that a North Pacific gray whale named Varvara has set a record for the longest migration of a mammal, with a distance of nearly 14,000 miles. The summary also mentions this record, stating that Varvara swam the longest distance of any mammal according to Guinness World Records.\n2. The article provides details about Varvara's migration route, which included crossing the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. The summary also mentions this route, stating that Varvara swam from the North Pacific to the North Coast of Mexico.\n3. The article quotes Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, as saying that Varvara's ability to navigate across open water over long distances is impressive and could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. The summary also quotes Mate, stating that Varvara's journey could suggest that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays.\n4. The article mentions that only 150 western gray whales are believed to exist, and that past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species. The summary also mentions this, stating that the number of western gray whales may be even lower.\n\nBased on these similarities, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary provides a brief overview of the article's main points, including Varvara's record-breaking migration, her route, and the implications of her journey for our understanding of the gray whale species."}
