The summary implies that fracking drilling has been confirmed in Lancashire by the British Geological Survey (BGS) following a major quake in April.\n2. However, the article discusses the suspension of shale gas drilling (known as \"fracking\") in Lancashire due to a 1.5 magnitude tremor, not a \"major quake.\" The article mentions the BGS's involvement in monitoring fracking-induced tremors but does not confirm fracking drilling as the cause of a \"major quake\" in April.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly characterizes the seismic event as a \"major quake\" linked to fracking drilling, whereas the article describes a smaller tremor and its impact on fracking operations.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.

The summary states that the British Geological Survey (BGS) has confirmed the presence of fracking in Lancashire, which is supported by the article as the BGS has indeed confirmed the presence of the process in the area following the recent earthquakes.\n3. The summary mentions the location of the earthquakes in Poulton-le-Fylde, which is the same location mentioned in the article as the epicenter of the recent earthquakes.\n4. The summary quotes Dr. Brian Baptie, the head of seismology at the BGS, who is also quoted in the article.\n5. The summary mentions the similarity of the waveforms of the two recent earthquakes, which is also mentioned in the article as a similarity between the two events.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article as it accurately represents the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is (yes)."}
