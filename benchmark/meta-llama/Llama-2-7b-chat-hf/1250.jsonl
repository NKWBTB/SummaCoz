The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary mentions a plan to demolish a five-storey hotel. However, there is no mention of \"a five-storey hotel\". Instead, the article states that three Victorian hotels will go to make way for a six-storey, four star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the location of the development as East Cliff in Bournemouth, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n2. The article states that three Victorian hotels will be demolished to make way for a six-storey, four-star hotel and two assisted-living apartment blocks, while the summary simply mentions \"a five-storey hotel\" will be demolished. This discrepancy suggests that the summary may not be entirely accurate.\n3. The article quotes Councillor David Kelsey as saying that the buildings earmarked for demolition are no longer \"necessarily functional,\" which is consistent with the summary's mention of \"a five-storey hotel\" that is \"no longer functional.\"\n4. The article provides more details about the proposed development, including the number of rooms in the new hotel and the height of the assisted-living apartment blocks, which are not mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. The summary mentions a different location and a different number of floors for the hotel, and does not provide the same level of detail about the proposed development as the article does. Therefore, I would answer (no) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
