The summary states that a horse died after being hit by a horse in Cheltenham, as per what a trainer has said.\n2. However, the article reports that the horse, named Many Clouds, collapsed and died after narrowly beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. There is no mention in the article of the horse being \"hit by a horse.\" The horse's death is attributed to a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that the horse died from being hit by another horse, whereas the article provides a different cause of death, a severe pulmonary haemorrhage, which is unrelated to being hit by another horse.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Reasoning:\n\nThe article provides detailed information about the incident, including the horse's breed, the race it was competing in, and the cause of death. The summary, on the other hand, is very brief and lacks specific details. The summary only mentions that a horse died after being hit by another horse in Cheltenham, without providing any context or information about the incident.\n\nHere are some key points from the article that are missing from the summary:\n\n* The horse's breed and name\n* The race it was competing in (Cotswold Chase)\n* The cause of death (severe pulmonary haemorrhage)\n* The horse's previous health issues (post-race ataxia)\n* The trainer's comments on the horse's condition\n\nTherefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it lacks important details that are provided in the original text.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
