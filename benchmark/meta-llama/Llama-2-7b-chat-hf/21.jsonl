Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the name of the footballer involved, which is consistent with the article as it mentions the name of the footballer, Sam Livesey, multiple times.\n2. The summary mentions the alleged incident of punching a rival in the face, which is consistent with the article as it reports on an incident where Livesey allegedly punched Oldham's Jack Tuohy in the temple without provocation.\n3. The summary mentions the charge brought against Livesey by the Football Association, which is consistent with the article as it reports on the FA charging Livesey with violent conduct.\n4. The summary mentions the potential punishment for Livesey's actions, which is consistent with the article as it reports on the FA considering a lengthy ban for Livesey.\n5. The summary does not mention any information that is not present in the article, such as any additional details about the incident or Livesey's response to the charge.\n\nBased on these points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article.
