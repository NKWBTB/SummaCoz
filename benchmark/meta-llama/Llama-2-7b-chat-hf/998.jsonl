{"document": "A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December \u2013 but didn\u2019t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: \u2018I stopped because I couldn\u2019t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.\u2019 Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff . The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner\u2019s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to \u2018use an ATM\u2019 before making a run for it. \u2018The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi \u2013 I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,\u2019 Mr Robinson told the inquest. \u2018Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.\u2019 Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker . A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out. \u00a0Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were . Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: \u2018It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. \u2018There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.\u2019 Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend\u2019s house but he and his friends didn\u2019t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by \u2018dodging\u2019 the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the \u2018pitch black\u2019 and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade \u2013 also called The Dardanelles.
