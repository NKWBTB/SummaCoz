Here's why:\n\n1. Location: The article mentions the location of the crash as the southbound carriageway near the Hindhead tunnel at Bramshott, while the summary mentions central London. However, the article does not provide a specific location for the crash, only mentioning the general area of London. Therefore, the summary's mention of central London is not inconsistent with the article.\n2. Number of vehicles involved: The article mentions several vehicles were involved in the crash, while the summary only mentions one vehicle. However, the article does not provide a specific number of vehicles involved, so the summary's mention of one vehicle is not inconsistent.\n3. Fatality: The article confirms that a 32-year-old man died in the crash, while the summary simply states that a man has died. This is consistent with the article, as it does not provide any information about the identity of the deceased.\n4. Arrest: The article mentions that a 33-year-old man from Waterlooville was arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention, while the summary does not mention any arrest. However, the article does not provide any information about the arrest, so the summary's lack of mention is not inconsistent.\n5. Road closure: The article mentions that the road was closed between Thursley and Liphook until early evening while officers investigated the scene, while the summary does not mention any road closure. However, the article does not provide any information about the duration of the road closure, so the summary's lack of mention is not inconsistent.\n\nBased on these comparisons, I can confidently say that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
