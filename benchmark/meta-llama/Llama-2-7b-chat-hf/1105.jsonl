The summary claims that supermarkets of state-run paper in Singapore have been canceled due to the haze, while the article states that only seven firms, including major supermarkets, have been asked to declare that they are not sourcing materials from companies suspected of contributing to the haze.\n2. The summary uses the phrase \"state-run paper paper,\" which is not a correct phrase. The article does not mention anything about a state-run paper company, and it is likely that the summary is a typo or a misunderstanding.\n3.

The summary mentions the haze caused by the air, which is also mentioned in the article as the cause of the haze in Singapore and other countries in the region.\n3. The summary mentions the removal of products from one Indonesian firm, which is also mentioned in the article as a response to the haze.\n4. The summary mentions the request from the government to retailers to declare that they have not procured or used wood, paper, and/or pulp materials from firms accused of contributing to the haze, which is also mentioned in the article.\n5. The summary mentions the commitment of retailers to sustainable procurement processes and the support of consumers for brands with environmentally friendly practices, which is also mentioned in the article as a way for retailers to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and for consumers to show their support for brands with environmentally friendly practices.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article as it accurately summarizes the main points and information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is (yes)."}
