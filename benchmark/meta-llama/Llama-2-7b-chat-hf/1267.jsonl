The summary states that police are investigating a suspicious fire at a house in county antrim.\n2. However, the article does not mention a fire in county antrim.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the location of the fire as the Sangomore area of Durness, while the summary simply says \"county Antrim.\" While the article does not provide the exact location of the fire in Antrim, it does mention the location of the fire in Durness, which is in the Scottish Highlands. Therefore, the summary's mention of \"county Antrim\" is not inconsistent with the article.\n2. The article quotes Detective Inspector Richard Baird as saying that the fire is not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused has prevented entry to the property. The summary simply repeats this information without providing any additional details.\n3. The article mentions that a joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out, and that structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property. The summary does not provide any information about a joint investigation or structural engineers.\n4. The article does not mention anything about police investigating a suspicious fire at a house in county Antrim. While the summary does mention \"police are investigating a suspicious fire,\" it does not provide any information about the location of the fire.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I can confidently say that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary provides information that is not supported by the article, such as the location of the fire being in county Antrim instead of the Scottish Highlands, and the mention of a joint investigation and structural engineers without any supporting evidence in the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (no) the summary is not consistent with the article."}
