It mentions a former inmate's claim about the use of drones for smuggling but does not mention a statement from the prison secretary about inmates being \"notorious\" due to a \"breakdown.\"\n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"inmates at a prison in Essex\" which is also mentioned in the article as \"residents\" of Chelmsford Prison.\n2. The summary refers to the prison being \"notorious\" for contraband smuggling, which is also mentioned in the article as the prison being \"flooded\" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis.\n3. The summary mentions \"a breakdown\" in the prison's security, which is also mentioned in the article as the Ministry of Justice acknowledging that more needs to be done to prevent contraband from getting into prisons.\n4. The summary mentions \"laws have been introduced which mean people who smuggle packages over prison walls could be jailed for up to two years,\" which is also mentioned in the article as the Ministry of Justice stating that staff work \"extremely hard\" to stop contraband from getting into prisons and that laws have been introduced to address the issue.\n\nBased on these similarities, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Therefore, the answer is (yes)."}
