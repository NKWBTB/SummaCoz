{"document": "Although there is some common ground between the two governments on, for example, the need for free trade within the single market, Carwyn Jones has complained that he didn't see the letter before it was published on Wednesday. (He has that in common with most of Mrs May's cabinet).\nThe first minister told AMs: \"I discussed the Article 50 letter in general terms with the prime minister when we met in Swansea last week.\n\"I should be clear, though, that I didn't see the letter before today and we were not invited to contribute to its drafting. This is unacceptable and is the culmination of a deeply frustrating process in which the devolved administrations have persistently been treated with a lack of respect.\n\"It is all the more regrettable given the UK government's stated aim was to develop a negotiating framework for the whole of the UK.\"\nMr Jones may have been playing to an audience, but Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns hit back: \"I'm a bit disappointed in that. The prime minister has been in Wales three times in the last six weeks.\n\"We've been talking about the contents of this letter for many months.\n\"We've clearly all made our representations but, ultimately, the UK government needs to act in the interests of the whole of the UK and that's what we're doing, specifically with Wales being mentioned.\"\nMrs May did indeed mention Wales in the letter.

Farming? Economic aid? And will the money follow the powers?\nAlun Cairns wouldn't answer those questions, although Carwyn Jones has said he fears there won't be any money to accompany the powers after 2020.

The article also mentions that Alun Cairns, the Welsh Secretary, hit back at Jones' criticism, suggesting that the UK government has been working on the contents of the letter for months and will act in the interests of the whole of the UK.\n\nThe article provides several specific examples of how the letter mentions Wales, including the expectation that the UK government will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

The summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, including Jones' criticism of the letter and the mention of Wales in the letter. The summary also captures the tone of the article, which is focused on the tensions between the UK government and the devolved administrations over the Brexit process."}
