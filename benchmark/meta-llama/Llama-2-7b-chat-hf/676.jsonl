The summary mentions Laura Muir's target for the Commonwealth Games, which is consistent with the article's mention of Muir's desire to compete at the Commonwealth Games despite missing out on a medal at the Glasgow Indoor Grand Prix.\n2. The summary mentions Muir's studies, which is consistent with the article's mention of Muir's veterinary medicine studies and how they will prevent her from being with the Scotland team at the Commonwealth Games.\n3.
