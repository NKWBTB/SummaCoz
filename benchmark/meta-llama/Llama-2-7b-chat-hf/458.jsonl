The summary states that the council has said that businesses and businesses on the Isle of Wight are to be allowed to free up the new chain ferry.\n2. However, the article discusses the issues and challenges faced by the new chain ferry on the Isle of Wight, including breakdowns, grounding, and suspension by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It mentions that the council has made the Cowes crossing free until 2 July for various reasons, but it doesn't explicitly state that this is to \"free up\" businesses.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary implying that the council's decision to make the ferry crossing free is primarily aimed at benefiting businesses, while the article provides a broader context of the ferry's problems and the council's response without specifying that the decision is solely for the benefit of businesses.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the council leader, Dave Stewart, making a call to provide free crossings until July 2 to address the problems with the new ferry. The summary also mentions the council allowing businesses on the Isle of Wight to use the ferry for free. This is consistent with the article's mention of the council leader making a call to provide free crossings.\n2. The article highlights the issues with the new ferry, including breakdowns, running aground, and being suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to training issues. The summary does not mention any of these issues.\n3. The article quotes Transport Councillor Ian Ward saying that compensation is up for discussion. The summary does not mention anything about compensation.\n4. The article mentions the council authorizing the manufacture of ramp extensions to resolve the problem of vehicles scraping the concrete. The summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article in terms of the information provided. However, the summary does not provide the same level of detail or context as the article, and it does not mention some of the key issues raised in the article. Therefore, I would answer (yes) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the article."}
