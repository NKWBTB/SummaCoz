The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that Google has pledged $1 billion to research and development of artificial intelligence (AI).\n2. However, the article does not mention Google at all. Instead, it talks about a venture called OpenAI, which is backed by several companies and individuals, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions the venture's backers, including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Infosys, and Amazon Web Services. The summary also mentions Google, which is consistent with the article as it mentions Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as backers.\n2. The article states that Open AI aims to advance digital intelligence in a way that is most likely to benefit humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. The summary also mentions that the venture aims to research AI without financial obligations, which is consistent with the article's statement on Open AI's goals.\n3. The article quotes Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk as expressing concerns about the potential threats of AI to humanity. The summary does not mention any quotes or statements from these individuals, but it does mention that other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote, which is consistent with the article's tone of presenting a balanced view on the topic.\n4. The article mentions that only a tiny fraction of the $1 billion pledged will be spent in the next few years. The summary does not provide any specific information on the amount of funding, but it does mention that Google has pledged $1 billion (\u00a3800m) to research and development of AI, which is consistent with the article's information on the venture's funding.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article in terms of the information it provides and the tone it adopts. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes."}
