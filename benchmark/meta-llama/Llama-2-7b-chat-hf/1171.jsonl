Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later.\n\"It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,\" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading.\n\"The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies).\n\"John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either.\n\"It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books.\"\nThis year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner.\nLast year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries.

The summary refers to the book as \"The Lives of Others,\" which is the same title as the book mentioned in the article.\n3. The summary mentions the book's focus on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism, which is consistent with the article's description of the book as set in Calcutta in 1967 and focusing on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism.\n4. The summary mentions the book's sales figures, which are consistent with the article's mention of the book's sales figures.\n5. The summary quotes David Brauner, a professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading, who is quoted in the article as saying that the list of shortlisted authors is weak and that the strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's \"J.\" This is consistent with the article's mention of Brauner's comments on the strength of the list and the potential reluctance to award the prize to a repeat winner.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article.
