{"document": "Presiding officer Tricia Marwick shed tears after veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil bid farewell to the parliament.And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: \"It's goodbye from me... for now\".Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May.Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was \"not divided, but diverse\".He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: \"Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland.\"And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that\".He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign.There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \"major attraction down south today\".He then added: \"However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.\"And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, \"albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm\".He concluded his address by saying: \"Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament.\"There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country.\"And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now\".Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had \"served the parliament and Scotland with distinction\".The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999.Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system.He said: \"It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary.\"We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.\"He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster.But Mr McNeil said: \"It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.\"Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.In her speech, she joked she would miss her dealings with Finance Secretary John Swinney, especially \"his huge outbursts of faux indignation\".", "claim": "former first minister alex salmond and scottish first minister alex salmond had to address the scottish parliament at holyrood.", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "35820385", "model_name": "TranS2S", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "xsum", "error_type": "OutE", "doc_sents": ["Presiding officer Tricia Marwick shed tears after veteran Labour MSP Duncan McNeil bid farewell to the parliament.", "And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: \"It's goodbye from me... for now\".", "Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May.", "Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was \"not divided, but diverse\".", "He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: \"Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided.", "There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland.", "\"And we are definitely stronger -

The summary states that former first minister Alex Salmond and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond had to address the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood.\n2. However, the article provides information about Alex Salmond, a former First Minister of Scotland, addressing the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. The article mentions that Alex Salmond is stepping down as an MSP (Member of the Scottish Parliament) and delivers a valedictory address. There is no mention of another individual named \"Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond\" in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary introducing a \"Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond\" alongside the actual former First Minister Alex Salmond, which is not supported by the content of the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"former first minister Alex Salmond\" and \"Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond,\" which is consistent with the article's use of both titles to refer to Salmond.\n2. The summary states that Salmond had to address the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood, which is consistent with the article's mention of Salmond delivering a valedictory address in the parliament.\n3. The summary mentions Salmond's belief that Scotland is \"not divided, but diverse,\" which is consistent with the article's mention of Salmond repeating this belief in his valedictory address.\n4. The summary notes that Salmond welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, which is consistent with the article's mention of Salmond expressing support for the bill.\n5. The summary mentions Salmond's jokes about competition from a \"major attraction down south today\" and his wishing everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, which is consistent with the article's mention of Salmond's lighthearted moments during his address.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points and sentiments expressed by Salmond in the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes) the summary is consistent with the article."}
