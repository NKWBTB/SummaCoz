Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"the Scottish dairy industry\" while the article specifically refers to \"Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group.\" This is consistent because the article is focused on Harbro Group, a company within the Scottish dairy industry.\n2. The summary states that the industry reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.5m for 2015, which is consistent with the article's mention of Harbro Group's pre-tax profit increasing by \u00a3800,000 to \u00a33.5m in the year to the end of June 2016.\n3. The article mentions that Harbro Group has a network of 19 shops across Scotland operating under the Country Store brand, and the summary does not contradict this information.\n4. The article quotes the company as saying that the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict, and the summary does not provide any information that contradicts this statement.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
