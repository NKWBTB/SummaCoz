A drinking competition went tragically wrong when a student died after downing 25 shots of vodka. Humberto Moura Fonseca, 23, had been partying at the university of Julio de Mesquita in the city of Bauru, in southwest Brazil, when organisers suggested the drinking game to see who could drink 25 shots in less than 60 seconds. His friend Rodrigo Pancetti, 23, said: 'We were all having a great time and someone came up with the idea of the drinking competition. 'I knew I'd already had too much and there was no way I was going to be able to drink five, let alone 25. But Humberto and the others were really up for it. 'On his Facebook there is a quote, a motto, from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky which says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom. I never thought that would become reality. 'But once he had finished he said he felt ill and suddenly collapsed. 'We assumed it was because he was drunk but then six others also collapsed, including the winner, so we called an ambulance.' Medical crews rushed the students to hospital but Mr Fonesca died on the way. A hospital spokesman said: 'They all had alcohol poisoning and are in a critical state, with three still in intensive care.' Now police say they are looking to charge the organisers with homicide.
