The summary states that the assembly's assembly has approved a motion to pardon convictions for gay and bisexual men in England and Wales.\n2. However, the article does not mention any approval or motion being passed by the \"assembly's assembly\". Instead, the article discusses a proposal to bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales in granting pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, referred to as 'Turing's Law.' The article mentions that a motion is expected to be presented in the Northern Ireland Assembly for approval, but it does not confirm the approval itself.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary inaccurately suggesting that the Northern Ireland Assembly has already approved the motion, while the article deoe not mention such information and discusses the intention to propose such a motion for consideration.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"the assembly's assembly\" which is the same language used in the article to refer to the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n2. The summary states that the motion has been approved, which is consistent with the article's mention of the motion going before the assembly for approval.\n3. The summary mentions \"convictions for gay and bisexual men in England and Wales,\" which is the same language used in the article to describe the proposed pardons.\n4. The summary does not mention any additional provisions or changes to the article's information.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary accurately represents the information in the article. Therefore, the answer is (yes) the summary is consistent with the article."}
