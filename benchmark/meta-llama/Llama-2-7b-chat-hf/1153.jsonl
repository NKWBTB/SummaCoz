Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions the Serbs losing to Brazilians Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares in Rio, while the summary mentions defending champion Novak Djokovic suffering a surprise defeat by Juan Martin del Potro in the first round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto. This is a clear contradiction, as the article is referring to a different tournament than the one mentioned in the summary.\n2. The article does not mention anything about Djokovic losing to American Sam Querrey, as mentioned in the summary.\n3. The article does mention Djokovic's 12-time Grand Slam win and his 30th Masters title, which is consistent with the summary's mention of Djokovic's success in tennis.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is (no)."}
