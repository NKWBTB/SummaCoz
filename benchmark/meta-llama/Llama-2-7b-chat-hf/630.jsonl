However, the article does not mention a Russian air strike in Turkey being shot down and killed by a Russian jet. Instead, the article discusses the downing of a Russian Su-24 jet by Turkish F-16 fighters near the Turkish-Syrian border. The incident is described as a dispute between Russia and Turkey involving a Russian military aircraft and Turkish fighter jets. It doesn't involve a Russian air strike.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly portrays the incident as a Russian air strike in Turkey being shot down by another Russian jet, which is not what the article reports.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"a Russian air strike in Turkey\" which is consistent with the article's mention of the Su-24 jet being shot down by F-16 fighters.\n2. The summary states that the Russian president has said that the jet was shot down, which is consistent with the article's quote from Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, saying that flight information appeared to be missing.\n3. The summary does not mention any information that contradicts the article. For example, the article mentions that the downing of the jet plunged relations between Russia and Turkey into crisis, while the summary does not mention any information that would suggest the crisis was not related to the shooting down of the Su-24.\n4. The summary does not introduce any new information that is not present in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, I can confidently say that the summary is consistent with the article."}
