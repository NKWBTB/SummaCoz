The article actually refers to \"Pop Recs Ltd\" which is a record shop in Sunderland.\n2. The summary states that the band has been given the green light to sell the building, but the article does not mention anything about the band selling the building. In fact, the article mentions that the council is selling the building for student accommodation.\n3. The summary does not provide any information about the history of Pop Recs Ltd or its significance to the community, which is a major aspect of the article.\n4. The summary does not mention any quotes from Dave Harper, the drummer who runs the shop, or any other members of the community who have benefited from the shop's activities.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (no)."}
