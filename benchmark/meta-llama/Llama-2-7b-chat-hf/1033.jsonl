The summary has a repetitive phrase \"celebrity celebrity\".\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"celebrity reality TV star Peter Wright\" taking over from \"celebrity reality TV star Tim Ricayericay town.\" The article mentions \"Dan Groves\" saying that the \"finer points\" of a deal which could see Wright buy 20% of the club are yet to be released. This suggests that Wright is involved in the takeover of the club, which is consistent with the summary.\n2. The summary mentions \"Billericay\" and \"Glenn Tamplin,\" who recently took over the club. The article mentions Billericay being taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said he was \"comfortable\" investing \u00a310,000 a week. This confirms that Tamplin is the new owner of the club, as mentioned in the summary.\n3. The summary mentions \"Paul Konchesky,\" a former England international who signed for Billericay at the start of March. The article does not mention Konchesky, so this information is not supported by the article.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the summary is consistent with the article in terms of the information it provides about the takeover of Billericay Football Club. Therefore, the answer is (yes)."}
