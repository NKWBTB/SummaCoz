Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill. To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds. Scroll down for video . A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail.\u00a0Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket . The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes. This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed. Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, R\u00e9union and Mauritius. Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. Lifespan: Two to five years . Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth. The tongue\u2019s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself. In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion. The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved. Previous studies didn\u2019t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said. When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics.

The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that the panther shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds.\n2. But the fact in article is the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds.\n3. The chameleon is the key word in the sentence mentioned in article but the summary missed it, thus it is inconsistent with article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the speed at which the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue, which is consistent with the article's claim of the tongue reaching around 41G - four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The article provides a specific time frame of \"little more than 0.07 seconds\" for the tongue's movement, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n2. The summary highlights the bone in the base of the tongue that fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. This is consistent with the article's explanation of how the tongue's muscles are fixed in place by a bone and special tissue, which allows for rapid movement.\n3. The summary mentions the tongue's tip forming a small suction cup as it hits its prey, which is consistent with the article's description of the tongue's tip being a bulbous ball of muscle that forms a suction cup to drag in prey.\n4. The summary does not mention any information that contradicts the article's content.\n\nBased on the above, I can confidently say that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
