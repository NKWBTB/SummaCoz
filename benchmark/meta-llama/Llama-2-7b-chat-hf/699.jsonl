However, the article does not mention any such charge against a man for causing the death of a woman in Limavady, County Londonderry. The article discusses an incident at Joe's Bar in Dungiven, involving a sudden death, violations of liquor licensing hours, legal actions against individuals associated with the bar, and fines imposed on them. There is no mention of a man being charged with causing a woman's death in Limavady.\n3.
