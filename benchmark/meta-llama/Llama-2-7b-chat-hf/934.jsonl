{"document": "Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone. Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'", "claim": "Hull City are six points adrift of safety and Steve Bruce is adamant they can avoid relegation.", "label": 0, "model_name": "M20", "cnndm_id": "dm-test-3785743303ddb8b594be7c449a37458b99e83812", "cut": "val", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "summeval", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "error", "doc_sents": ["Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up.", "At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.'", "Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing.", "Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation .", "They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United.", "But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it.", "If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line.", "'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year.", "I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation.", "Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone .", "'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope.", "We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.'", "Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players.", "At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three.", "Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all.", "Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope.", "We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.'", "James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth .", "Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday.", "But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice.", "Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone.", "Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'"], "sum_sents": ["Hull City are six points adrift of safety and Steve Bruce is adamant they can avoid relegation."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 3, 9], "cot": "1.
