The summary states that a collection of valuable items has been put up for sale at a museum in Staffordshire.\n2.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that about 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters, and photographs are being auctioned to pay off the pension debt of the pottery firm. The summary also mentions a collection worth up to a certain amount being put up for sale at a museum in Staffordshire, which aligns with the article's mention of the Wedgwood Museum inheriting the pension bill of Waterford Wedgwood plc.\n2. The article quotes Administrator Bob Young as saying that the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire. The summary does not mention anything about the collection being moved or sold to a different location.\n3. The article highlights the significance of the collection, stating that it charts a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and plays a crucial part in defining the country's national identity today. The summary does not diminish or contradict this point in any way.\n4. The article quotes Alison Wedgwood as saying that the collection was important for Staffordshire and risked being sold and scattered around the globe had the money not been raised. The summary does not provide any opposing viewpoints or contradictions to this statement.\n5. The article quotes Tristram Hunt MP as saying that the sale is \"fantastic news\" and that the items contained within the Wedgwood collection chart a significant part of Britain's cultural development over centuries and play a crucial part in defining the country's national identity today. The summary does not provide any opposing viewpoints or contradictions to this statement.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
