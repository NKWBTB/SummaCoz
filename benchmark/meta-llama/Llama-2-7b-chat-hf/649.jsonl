Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"defender Scott Anderson\" joining Torquay United, while the article mentions \"centre-back Anderson\" joining the club. This is a minor inconsistency, but it suggests that the summary may not have been carefully proofread.\n2. The summary states that Anderson has \"cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent,\" while the article does not mention anything about Barrow. This is an inconsistency, as the article clearly states that Anderson was previously at Aldershot and Exeter before joining Torquay United.\n3. The summary mentions \"striker Keating, 21,\" while the article only mentions \"striker Keating\" without providing an age. This is a minor inconsistency, but it suggests that the summary may not have been carefully written.\n4. The summary states that Keating was \"recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams,\" while the article does not mention anything about Micky Adams. This is an inconsistency, as the article clearly states that Keating was recommended to Nicholson by Adams.\n5. The summary mentions \"the Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone,\" while the article does not provide any information about the team's current standing in the league. This is an inconsistency, as the article clearly states the team's position in the league table.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, it is likely that the summary was not carefully written or proofread, and may contain errors or inaccuracies. Therefore, the answer to the question is (no) the summary is not consistent with the article."}
