The article does not mention anything about schools or encouraging dogs to eat at schools. The article only mentions that the restaurant began serving puppy platters after a new law was introduced allowing dogs to eat at restaurants outdoors.\n4.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that the restaurant began serving puppy platters after a new law was introduced, which is consistent with the summary's statement that the restaurant took place in London to encourage dogs to eat at schools in England and Wales.\n2. The article mentions that the law allows dogs to eat at restaurants as long as they are outdoors, which is consistent with the summary's statement that the restaurant is in London.\n3. The article does not mention any specific location outside of London, which means that the summary's statement that the restaurant is in London is not contradictory to the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article and the summary, it is consistent to say that the summary is supported by the article. I answer (yes) to the question."}
