The summary mentions the location of the incident as \"London's Al\" which is not accurate as the article clearly states that the incident occurred in Morocco, specifically at the Mohammed V stadium.\n2. The summary talks about fans throwing flares and flares at the stadium, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only mentions that 31 people were arrested for \"acts of vandalism\" and that the country's DGSN security service revealed 10 people had been arrested prior to the game.\n3. The summary mentions a fine of \u00a37,000, which is not mentioned in the article. The article states that FMRFF has banned fans from the next five Raja home matches and fined the club 100,000 dirhams (\u00a37,170).\n4. The summary mentions the fans being dressed in the club's green colors, which is mentioned in the article as footage on Moroccan media showed the fans, dressed in the club's green colors, charging at each other.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, it can be concluded that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.
