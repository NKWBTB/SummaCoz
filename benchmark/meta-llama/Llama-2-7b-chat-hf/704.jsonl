The article also mentions Jak's name multiple times, including in the headline and throughout the text.\n2. The summary states that Jak died from his cancer. The article confirms this by quoting Jak's mother, Allison, who broke the news of her son's death on his Facebook page.\n3. The summary mentions that Jak had been documenting his life and treatment on social media. The article also highlights Jak's social media presence, including his Facebook page called \"Jak's Journey,\" where he shared updates on his cancer battle and his meetings with former Rangers FC players.\n4. The summary mentions that Jak attended a prom held in his honor, where he was greeted by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson. The article also mentions the prom and how Jak managed to make it for 10 minutes before feeling unwell and having to leave.\n5. The summary does not provide any additional information beyond what is mentioned in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article, the summary is consistent and accurate in its summary of Jak Trueman's story.\n\nAnswer: Yes"}
