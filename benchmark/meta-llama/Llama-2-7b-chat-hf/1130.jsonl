Here's why:\n\n1. The article discusses the impact of sea-level rise on the Dawlish to Teignmouth rail line, which connects Cornwall and Devon to the rest of the UK. The summary also mentions the line's vulnerability to sea-level rise.\n2. The article quotes academics from Plymouth University, the University of Leeds, and the University of York as saying that there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales, south-east England, the Cumbrian coast, and Scotland. The summary does not mention any other regions.\n3. The article mentions that Network Rail hopes to develop \"long-term interventions\" to secure the future of the line, and that the Department for Transport has invested \u00a331m into improving the resilience of the route. The summary does not provide any additional information on the department's investment or the long-term interventions.\n4. The article quotes Dr David Dawson from the University of Leeds as saying that the long-term future of the line is \"really worrying\". The summary does not provide any additional quotes or information on Dawson's views.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article in that it mentions the same topic (the impact of sea-level rise on the Dawlish to Teignmouth rail line), quotes academics and officials from the article, and does not provide any contradictory information. Therefore, the answer is (yes) the summary is consistent with the article."}
