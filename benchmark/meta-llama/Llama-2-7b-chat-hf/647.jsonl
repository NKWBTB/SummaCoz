The article provides a breakdown of the campaign expenditure for each party, including the Liberal Democrats, and the summary accurately reflects this information.\n3. The article states that the Liberal Democrats lost 11 of their 12 MEPs, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the party losing \"11 of their MEPs.\"\n4.
