The summary implies that a maritime attraction has been canceled due to a lack of funds and is at the center of a public inquiry.\n2. However, the article does not mention the cancellation of a maritime attraction or a public inquiry related to it. The article discusses issues with a new chain ferry, breakdowns, grounding, and problems with the ferry's operation, but it doesn't mention the cancellation of a maritime attraction due to a lack of funds.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a completely unrelated topic of a maritime attraction being canceled, which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions a maritime attraction that has been cancelled due to a lack of funds, which is consistent with the article's mention of the new vessel and its problems.\n2. The summary refers to a public inquiry, which is also mentioned in the article as a means of addressing the issues surrounding the new ferry.\n3. The summary quotes a shopkeeper named Angie Booth who expresses concern about the impact of the ferry's problems on local businesses, which is consistent with the article's mention of local businesses being damaged by the ferry's issues.\n4. The summary mentions that compensation is up for discussion, which is consistent with the article's mention of Transport councillor Ian Ward saying that compensation was being considered.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
