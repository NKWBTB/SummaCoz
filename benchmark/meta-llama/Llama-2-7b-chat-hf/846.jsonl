{"document": "A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday as part of what began with a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington. Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city. Scroll down for video Critical: A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA. The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports. The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed. According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C. The barricade caused a collision between the suspect's car and a police cruiser, NBC reports. The suspect was shot several times. Two police officers were also wounded in the showdown, but reportedly had non-life threatening injuries.", "claim": "the shooter , only described as a man in his 30s or 40s , may even be tied to another shooting that occurred thursday in the southeast UNK of the city . police believe the shooter had barricaded himself inside after noticing a couple fighting in a car .", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "281d340a0b9ba6fa2f5526ecd59db7cdcc1de4cc", "model_name": "s2s", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "LinkE", "doc_sents": ["A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died Thursday as part of what began with a suspect kidnapping his own wife at gunpoint in Washington.", "Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates.", "However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street.", "Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city.", "Scroll down for video", "Critical:", "A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C.", "Shooter:", "Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside", "'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA.", "The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports.", "The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed.", "According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car.", "He went to investigate and it cost him his life.", "Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports:", "Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects", "The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported.", "But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC.", "Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C.", "The barricade caused a collision between the suspect's car and a police cruiser, NBC reports.", "The suspect was shot several times.", "Two police officers were also wounded in the showdown, but reportedly had non-life threatening injuries."], "sum_sents": ["the shooter , only described as a man in his 30s or 40s , may even be tied to another shooting that occurred thursday in the southeast UNK of the city .", "police believe the shooter had barricaded himself inside after noticing a couple fighting in a car ."], "rel_index": [1, 3, 8, 12], "cot": "1.
