The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that the family of an 11-year-old boy from County Fermanagh has not been able to go to school because of a special education system.\n2. However, the article states that the family has been unable to secure a place for the boy in a special school due to the lack of available capacity in the special schools in the South Eastern Education Board area. It doesn't imply that the special education system itself is preventing the boy from going to school.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests that the special education system is the direct cause of the boy not being able to go to school, while the article specifies that it's the lack of available places in special schools that is the issue.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions the location of the boy's family, which is consistent with the article's mention of the boy being from Northern Ireland.\n2. The summary mentions the boy's age, which is consistent with the article's mention of the boy being 11 years old.\n3. The summary mentions the boy's inability to attend school due to a special education system, which is consistent with the article's mention of the boy's parents making the difficult decision to remove him from mainstream schooling because he was not coping.\n4. The summary mentions the family's concern about the lack of availability of special schools in the area, which is consistent with the article's mention of the Education Authority being unable to provide a place for the boy at a special school despite the family's request.\n5. The summary mentions the Education Authority's response to the family's concerns, which is consistent with the article's mention of the Education Authority's spokesperson saying that they could not comment on individual cases due to privacy concerns.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, including the location of the boy's family, his age, the reason for his inability to attend school, and the response of the Education Authority. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
