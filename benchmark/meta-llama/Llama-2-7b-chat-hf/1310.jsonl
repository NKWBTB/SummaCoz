Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions that Nationalist MPs will take control of the UK Parliament's energy and climate change select committee and Scottish affairs select committee. The summary also mentions a \"holyrood committee\" setting up a committee to give MPs more powers to the Scottish Parliament. This is consistent with the article as it mentions that the SNP will be chairing select committees, which is a parliamentary convention.\n2. The article states that the SNP won 56 of the 59 Westminster constituencies at the general election two weeks ago, which resulted in the party being the third largest, behind the Conservatives and Labour. The summary does not mention anything about the number of constituencies won by the SNP, but it does mention a \"holyrood committee\" setting up a committee to give MPs more powers to the Scottish Parliament. This is consistent with the article as the SNP being the third largest party at Westminster is a factor in determining which committees they will chair.\n3. The article quotes SNP chief whip Mike Weir as saying that the committees are especially important to Scotland in this parliament, and that the SNP chairing these committees will allow them to make progress on important issues and get the best deal for Scotland. The summary does not include any quotes from Mike Weir or provide any additional context beyond the mention of a \"holyrood committee\" setting up a committee to give MPs more powers to the Scottish Parliament. This is consistent with the article as the article provides context and quotes from SNP officials to explain the significance of the committees being chaired by the SNP.\n\nBased on the above, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
