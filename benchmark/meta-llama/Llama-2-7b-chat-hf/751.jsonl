{"document": "Ander Herrera has caught the eye in recent weeks after cementing a spot in Manchester United's starting line-up but it appears he does not actually have a clear sight at goal. Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net.
