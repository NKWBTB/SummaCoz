Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the company's new smartphone, the Dtek50, which offers improved security over rival Android devices. The summary does not mention anything about downloading products to Android smartphones.\n2. The article states that the Dtek50 is the company's second Android handset after switching focus away from its struggling BB10 platform. The summary does not provide any information about the company's previous handset or any other devices.\n3. The article quotes an analyst as saying that the phone was the \"right move\" but that the company still faced an \"uphill battle\" with devices. The summary does not include any quotes or references to an analyst.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer is (no) the summary is not consistent with the article."}
