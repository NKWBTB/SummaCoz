The summary states that the government has confirmed that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men. Instead, the article discusses the intention to pardon gay and bisexual men who were convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, in line with England and Wales' plans for automatic pardons under 'Turing's Law.' The article mentions the process of presenting a motion in the assembly for approval, securing executive agreement, and the aim of equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary inaccurately suggesting that the pardons are specifically for those convicted of sexually abusing gay men, while the article focuses on the broader context of pardoning men convicted of abolished sexual offences.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men\" which is a direct quote from the article. The article specifically mentions that the motion will allow for pardons for both posthumously and for living men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, including those related to sexual abuse.\n2. The summary accurately summarizes the contents of the article by stating that the government has confirmed the motion will go before the assembly for approval. The article mentions that the minister has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offences.\n3. The summary does not add any new information or interpretations that are not present in the article. It simply provides a concise summary of the main points mentioned in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, the summary is consistent with the article."}
