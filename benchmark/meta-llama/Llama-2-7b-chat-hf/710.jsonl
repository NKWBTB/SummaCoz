Purpose of the project: The summary mentions building a new theatre in the grounds of Alexandra Palace, while the article is about the restoration of the existing theatre and studios at the palace. The article also mentions the goal of transforming Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.\n3. Funding: The summary mentions a \u00a31m project, while the article mentions a much larger project with a budget of \u00a326.6m. The article also mentions that the Heritage Lottery Fund is contributing \u00a318.8m towards the project, while the summary does not provide any information about funding.\n4. Historical significance: The article mentions that the theatre at Alexandra Palace was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays, and early cinema screenings, and that it still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place. The summary does not provide any information about the history of the theatre.\n\nBased on these inconsistencies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article.
