The summary implies that the article is about police investigating the disappearance of a man in County Antrim and releasing CCTV footage of a man they want to trace.\n2. However, the article is about the search for Trevor Deely, a specific individual who went missing in Dublin, not County Antrim. The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, the area being searched in Dublin, the involvement of the Irish police (Garda\u00ed), and the release of CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly places the events in County Antrim, while the article is specific to the case of Trevor Deely in Dublin.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. Location: The summary mentions \"county Antrim,\" which is the same location mentioned in the article as the location where Trevor Deely was last seen.\n2. Disappearance: Both the article and the summary are discussing the disappearance of a man, specifically Trevor Deely in the article and an unnamed man in the summary.\n3. CCTV footage: The article mentions that CCTV footage of a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street was enhanced using specialist technology, and that detectives released the footage in April and appealed for the man to come forward. The summary does not mention any specific CCTV footage, but it does mention that police have released CCTV footage of a man they want to trace, which is consistent with the article.\n4. Garda\u00ed: Both the article and the summary mention the Irish police force, Garda\u00ed, who are investigating the disappearance.\n\nBased on these similarities, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is (yes)."}
