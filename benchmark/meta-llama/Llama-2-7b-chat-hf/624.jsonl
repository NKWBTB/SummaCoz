According to the article, \"Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.\" This suggests that children are more likely to eat foods that they have tried at school, rather than foods that their parents have cooked at home.\n2. The summary mentions that school meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and increase the variety of foods in their diet, which is also supported by the article. According to the article, \"School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.\"\n3. The summary mentions that school meals have moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety, which is supported by the article. According to the article, \"School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.\" This suggests that school meals have become healthier and more varied in recent years.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article.
