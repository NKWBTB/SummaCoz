The article states that witnesses heard up to a dozen shots being fired, which is consistent with the summary's mention of \"at least 12 people\" being killed.\n3. The article mentions that the suspects fled the scene, which is also mentioned in the summary.\n4. The article does not mention anything about the shooting occurring in New York City, but the summary does. However, this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the article is written in English, while the summary is written in a different language (German).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the article and the summary, it appears that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
