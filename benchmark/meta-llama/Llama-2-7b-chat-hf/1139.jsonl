The summary states that the site of a former power station in the Solent is set to be turned into a former oil chimney site. However, the article does not mention anything about the site being turned into a former oil chimney site.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the site of a former power station in the Solent, which is the same location as the Fawley Power Station mentioned in the article.\n2. The summary refers to the chimney of the power station as the \"former oil chimney site,\" which is the same term used in the article to describe the 198-meter-high chimney that dominates the Solent skyline.\n3. The article mentions that the power station was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the power station being \"former.\"\n4. The article also mentions that the site was sold to Fawley Waterside developers in 2016, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the site being turned into a former oil chimney site.\n5. The article quotes Aldred Drummond of Fawley Waterside as saying that the company would be \"mad to knock the chimney down,\" which is consistent with the summary's mention of the chimney being the \"signature piece of infrastructure.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
