{"document": "The humble honeybee may only be small, but scientists are hoping to use its brain to power a series of futuristic-style drones. Boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee. Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects. Scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee Professor James Marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made 'tremendous advances' The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex. One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions. 'Bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling,' Professor James Marshall reportedly told the BBC. 'If we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance.' Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see. To do this they mapped out the  brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain, Discovery Magazine reported. The software is then uploaded into the drone's circuitry which enables it to  fly around in a similar fashion to the bee. The projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot, each with unique abilities and configurations. Tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the University of Sheffield. In a video footage showing initial tests the drone, powered by the artificial bee brain, can be seen flying down a corridor. On the Green Brain website it states: 'Since the start of the project, the GB team has setup the lab, built and tested our robots, and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual-based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment. 'Current projects include navigation using the GB models, flight tests of our models with the BeeBot quadcopter, developing a Ground Control Station, initial testing with the chemosensors and more.'

The summary implies that scientists are working to create a robot that thinks, senses, and acts just like a boa (a type of snake), repeating this information multiple times.\n2. However, the article is about scientists working to recreate the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee, not a boa. The article discusses creating an artificial brain based on the honeybee's abilities and building drones that can mimic the behavior of honeybees.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which repeatedly mentions a \"boa\" instead of the intended \"bee.\" The article focuses on bees and their cognitive abilities, not boas.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the same project and goal as the article: \"scientists are working to create a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a boa.\" This is consistent with the article's focus on the Green Brain Project and its aim to recreate the cognitive abilities of the honeybee.\n2. The summary mentions the same key players as the article: \"scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects.\" This is consistent with the article's mention of Professor James Marshall and the Green Brain Project.\n3. The summary mentions the same technologies and techniques as the article: \"Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see.\" This is consistent with the article's description of the Green Brain Project's use of circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain and the uploading of software into the drone's circuitry.\n4. The summary mentions the same potential applications as the article: \"One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions.\" This is consistent with the article's mention of the potential uses of the robotic drones, such as pollination and search and rescue missions.\n\nBased on these similarities, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
