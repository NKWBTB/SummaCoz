The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states, \"a row has broken out between the Isle of Wight's troubled ferry service.\"\n2. However, the article discusses the problems and challenges faced by the new ferry service on the Isle of Wight, such as breakdowns, groundings, and damage to cars. It also mentions discussions about compensation for local businesses and the council's decision to offer free crossings until 2 July.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests a \"row\" between parties but does not provide a clear context for the dispute.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions a \"row\" has broken out, which is consistent with the article's mention of a \"scrutiny meeting\" of the council to discuss the problems surrounding the new vessel.\n2. The summary refers to \"problems surrounding the new vessel,\" which is consistent with the article's mention of the chain ferry breaking down, running aground, and being suspended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency due to \"training issues.\"\n3. The summary mentions \"local businesses,\" which is consistent with the article's mention of shopkeeper Angie Booth expressing concerns about the impact of the ferry problems on her business.\n4. The summary quotes Transport councillor Ian Ward as saying that compensation is up for discussion, which is consistent with the article's mention of the council authorizing the manufacture of ramp extensions to resolve the problem of vehicles scraping the concrete.\n5. The summary does not mention any information that is not present in the article, such as any specific details about the ferry's design or construction, or any quotes from other council members or stakeholders.\n\nBased on these points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
