Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport, which is consistent with the summary's mention of a flight from Inverness to Heathrow Airport.\n2. The article also states that Hial, the operator of Highlands and Islands Airports Limited, said the flights would allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home, which is consistent with the summary's mention of more flights to and from the Highlands.\n3. The article does not mention any flights to Heathrow Airport, which is consistent with the summary's focus on flights from Inverness to Heathrow.\n\nBased on the above, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
