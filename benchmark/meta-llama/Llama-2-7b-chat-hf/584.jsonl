However, the article discusses the Hebridean Celtic Festival (HebCelt) taking place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis from 19 to 22 July and mentions the use of an app for augmented reality experiences but does not mention the launch of a new augmented reality headset.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary introducing the concept of a new augmented reality headset, which is not mentioned in the article. The article focuses on the app and its features at HebCelt.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that visitors to the Hebridean Celtic Festival will be able to use an app to trigger online information from items such as signs and posters on the site. The summary also mentions an \"augmented reality headset\" without specifying what it is in relation to. However, since the article already mentions an app, it is likely that the summary is referring to the same thing.\n2. The article states that videos and band interviews will be among the online material available to view on phones and tablets. The summary does not mention any specific content, but it does mention \"information and interviews,\" which aligns with the article's mention of videos and band interviews.\n3. The article quotes HebCelt director Caroline Maclennan as saying, \"We are offering the new augmented reality experience as an extra feature to add to the enjoyment of visiting the festival this year.\" The summary does not attribute any quote to Caroline Maclennan, but it does mention \"the new augmented reality experience\" in the same context as the article.\n4. The article mentions that the augmented reality experience will be available during the festival, which takes place from 19 to 22 July. The summary does not provide a specific date range, but it does mention \"the isle of isle of lewis,\" which is the location of the festival.\n\nBased on these similarities, it seems likely that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
