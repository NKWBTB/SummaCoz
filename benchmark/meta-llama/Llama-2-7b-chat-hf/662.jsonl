The article mentions that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives, including the decision on whether to bring charges against suspects.\n3. The article specifically mentions that 23 suspects have been referred to the CPS for decisions on whether to bring charges, and that these include 15 related to the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and 8 related to an Independent Police Complaints Commission probe into the conduct of South Yorkshire and West Midlands Police.\n4. The summary only mentions \"six people have been charged in connection with the Hillsborough disaster,\" without providing any information on the number of suspects or the specific charges they face.\n\nTherefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article as it only provides a partial and inaccurate account of the information provided in the article.
