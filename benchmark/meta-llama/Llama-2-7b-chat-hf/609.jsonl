The article also mentions that these sides were meeting again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday.\n3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the error that implies the match was a one-day T20 international in Nagpur, while the article states that the match was a T20 cricket match in Greater Noida.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.

The summary mentions the early dismissal of Ireland's opener Paul Stirling, which is consistent with the article's mention of Stirling being dismissed for a duck.\n4. The summary mentions the partnership between Wilson and Wilson, which is consistent with the article's mention of Wilson and Porterfield adding valuable runs to Ireland's total.\n5. The summary mentions the contributions of Afghanistan's opening batsmen, Shahzad and Najeeb Tarakai, which is consistent with the article's mention of Shahzad and Tarakai putting on an opening stand of 51.\n6. The summary mentions the performance of Afghanistan's spinner Amir Hamza, which is consistent with the article's mention of Hamza being the only bowler to take more than one wicket on a day when the bat dominated.\n7.
