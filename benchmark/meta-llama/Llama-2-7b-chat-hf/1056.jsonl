The summary states that the threats were made through \"calls that were both pre-recorded and live,\" which is consistent with the article's mention of \"suspects using voice-disguising technology.\"\n3. The summary mentions the White House's response to the incidents, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer stating that such actions are \"unacceptable\" and President Trump making it \"abundantly clear\" that hate-motivated violence has no place in the country. This is consistent with the article's mention of President Trump's condemnation of the threats.\n4. The summary also mentions the FBI investigating possible civil rights violations in connection with the threats, which is consistent with the article's mention of the FBI and the US justice department investigating the incidents.\n5. The summary does not mention any information that is not present in the article, such as the exact locations of the threatened centers or the identities of the suspects.\n\nTherefore, the summary is consistent with the article and provides a concise summary of the main points."}
