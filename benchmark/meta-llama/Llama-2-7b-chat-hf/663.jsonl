The summary implies that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will be charged over the Hillsborough disaster, and this announcement has been made by the CPS.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses the CPS's upcoming meeting with victims' relatives to reveal its intentions regarding potential charges related to the Hillsborough disaster. It does not state that the CPS itself will be charged; instead, the CPS is responsible for considering charges against individuals in connection with the disaster.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which states that the CPS will be charged, whereas the article focuses on the CPS's role in deciding whether to bring charges against individuals in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) being charged over the Hillsborough disaster, which is supported by the article. The article states that the CPS will reveal its intentions at a meeting with victims' relatives regarding the disaster.\n2. The summary mentions the disaster occurring in 1989, which is consistent with the article's mention of the disaster happening on April 15, 1989.\n3. The summary mentions the deaths of 96 football fans, which is consistent with the article's mention of 96 fans being fatally injured in the disaster.\n4. The summary mentions new inquests into the disaster concluding that the fans were unlawfully killed, which is consistent with the article's mention of new inquests being held last year and finding that the fans were unlawfully killed.\n5. The summary mentions files of evidence being referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought, which is consistent with the article's mention of files of evidence being referred to the CPS last January.\n6. The summary mentions the CPS deciding whether charges should be brought against 23 suspects, which is consistent with the article's mention of 23 suspects being referred to the CPS.\n7. The summary mentions the decisions being made by Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the CPS, which is consistent with the article's mention of Sue Hemming being the head of the CPS's special crime and counter-terrorism division.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article.
