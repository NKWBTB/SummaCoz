Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the location of Fosse Park as being near junction 21 of the M1, which is consistent with the summary's mention of a west Yorkshire park.\n2. The article states that the park was bought in August for \u00a3345.5m, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the park needing more than 100 new parking units to improve facilities.\n3. The article quotes Ernie White, leader of Blaby District Council, as saying that the new owners of the park have met with the council to clear up \"potential planning questions\". This is consistent with the summary's mention of the council saying that more than 100 new parking units are needed to improve facilities at the park.\n4. The article quotes Paul Clarke, director of investments at Crown Estates, as saying that the park has become rather tired over the last few years and that they want to address parking and congestion issues around the park. This is consistent with the summary's mention of the need for more parking units.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
