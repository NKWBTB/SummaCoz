Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt.

The summary the three-year-old was seen outside of the macy's promenade in temecula at about 6am, but it didn't mention it is the mountain lion was seen outside, without mentioning the mountain lion just stating three-year-old, that would be misleading as it could be three-year-old people.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that the mountain lion was seen outside of Macy's at the Promenade Mall in Temecula, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the mall as the location where the mountain lion was spotted.\n2. The article states that a game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the game warden shooting the lion with a tranquilizer dart.\n3. The article reports that the lion died while it was being transported to another location for public safety, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the lion dying while it was being transported.\n4. The article mentions that the state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the department investigating the cause of the lion's death.\n5. The article quotes a spokesman with the department as saying that it is rare for an animal to die after being darted, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the lion's death being caused by a combination of stress and the drugs.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article in terms of the basic facts and details of the incident. Therefore, I would answer (yes) to the question."}
