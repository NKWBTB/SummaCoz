The summary states that the ban was imposed due to a US-made film that was condemned in the Muslim world, which is consistent with the article's explanation that the ban was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the amateur-made video \"Innocence of Muslims\" was uploaded to YouTube.\n3. The summary mentions that Google revealed last week that it had launched local versions of YouTube for Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, which is consistent with the article's statement that Google had launched a Pakistan-specific version of YouTube.\n4. The summary does not mention any information that is not supported by the article, such as any details of the deal between Google and the government or any specific terms of the agreement.\n\nTherefore, the summary is consistent with the article and can be considered a accurate summary of the article's content."}
