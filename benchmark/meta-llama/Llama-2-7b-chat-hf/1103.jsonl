Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions that Ashya King was treated for leukaemia, which is consistent with the article's mention of him having brain cancer.\n2. The summary states that Ashya suffered chemotherapy as a result of his treatment, which is supported by the article's mention of him receiving chemotherapy in Prague despite his parents' refusal.\n3. The summary does not mention any specific details about Ashya's treatment in Prague, such as the type of therapy he received or the duration of his stay, which is consistent with the article's focus on the breakdown in communication between the King family and the hospital.\n4. The summary does not include any quotes from the King family or other sources that are not present in the article, such as the family's claims about the hospital threatening them with a court order.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article without including any additional information or quotes that are not supported by the original source. Therefore, I answer (yes) to the question."}
