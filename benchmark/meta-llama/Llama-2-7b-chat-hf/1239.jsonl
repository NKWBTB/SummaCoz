The article does not mention anything about a student being taken to hospital. In fact, the article states that \"nobody was injured\" in the incident.\n3. The summary implies that the explosion was suspicious, while the article states that the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public.\n4. The article does mention that South Wales Police received a call after concerns about the safe storage of chemicals before a controlled explosion took place, which aligns with the summary's mention of \"a controlled explosion\".\n5. The article does not mention anything about the chemicals \"having become unstable\", which is mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is (no) the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
