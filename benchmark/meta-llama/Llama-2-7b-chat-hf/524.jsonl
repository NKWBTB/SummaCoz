However, the article states that Newport County has a lease to use the ground, and it mentions the uncertainty regarding the Welsh Rugby Union's (WRU) takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons and potential changes to the stadium.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which suggests that Steve Foxall's expectation of signing a new contract is the main focus, while the article discusses the broader context of stadium usage and potential changes due to the WRU takeover.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.

The summary states that Foxall expects to sign a new contract at Rodney Parade, which is consistent with the article as Foxall is quoted as saying that the club has a lease to use the ground until 2023 and that they expect the contract to be honoured.\n3. The summary mentions the WRU's takeover bid for Newport Gwent Dragons, which is consistent with the article as the WRU is indeed making a takeover bid for the club.\n4. The summary mentions the potential installation of an artificial surface at Rodney Parade, which is consistent with the article as the WRU has signaled their intention to install an artificial surface, which is against Football League rules.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article as all information in the summary is supported by the article.
