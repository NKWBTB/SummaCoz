Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the loss of more than 1,000 jobs at Wales' biggest steelworks, which is consistent with the article's mention of the impact of high energy prices on industry in Wales, including the steel industry.\n2. The summary quotes Economist Prof Calvin Jones as saying that Wales' growth areas have been in retail, hotels, back-office financial services, and the public sector, which is consistent with the article's mention of the Welsh government's efforts to support industries such as the chemical industry, other metals, and wood products.\n3. The summary quotes Rhun ap Iorwerth, the party's economy spokesman, as warning of deeper problems across a range of industries, which is consistent with the article's mention of the canary in the mine metaphor and the warning of deeper problems beyond the steel industry.\n4. The summary mentions the Welsh government's call on the UK government to address the impact of high energy prices on industry, which is consistent with the article's mention of the Welsh government's concerns about the impact of high UK energy prices on the competitiveness of Welsh industries and the Welsh government's request for the UK government to address this major problem.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
