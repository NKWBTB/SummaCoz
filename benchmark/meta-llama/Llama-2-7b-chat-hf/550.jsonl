The summary mentions plans for a glass tower on the edge of Southampton seafront.\n2. However, the article discusses plans for a glass structure at the disused Fawley power station, which is not located on the edge of Southampton seafront but rather on the western side of Southampton Water.\n3.

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the Fawley Power Station, which is located on the western shore of Southampton Water. The summary also mentions the location of the proposed glass tower, which is on the edge of Southampton seafront. This matches the information in the article.\n2. The article states that the power station was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes. The summary does not provide any information about the age of the power station or its power generation capacity. However, it does mention the Fawley Power Station, which suggests that it is the same station referred to in the article.\n3. The article quotes Aldred Drummond of Fawley Waterside developers as saying that the company would be \"mad to knock the chimney down\" and that it is their \"signature piece of infrastructure\". The summary does not include any quotes or references to the chimney or the developers' views on it.\n4. The article provides details about the size and features of the power station, including its 198-meter-high chimney, and mentions that 1,100 miles of cable were laid within the power station. The summary does not provide any information about the size or features of the power station or its chimney.\n\nBased on these comparisons, it appears that the summary is consistent with the article in terms of the location, age, and features of the Fawley Power Station, as well as the developers' views on the chimney. Therefore, I answer (yes) to the question."}
