Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that the decommissioned Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham, and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour, and bidders had until 23 January to register an interest in the former Devonport-based ships. The summary does not mention any plans to build a new generation of royal navy frigates on the Isle of Wight.\n2. The article states that the government's Disposal Services Authority is handling the sale of the frigates and wants to award at least one of them to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. The summary does not mention any plans to build a new generation of royal navy frigates.\n3. The article quotes Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, as saying that it is important for UK recyclers to have the chance to prove themselves in the field but also that she wants at least one of the frigates to be saved from the scrapyard. The summary does not mention any plans to build a new generation of royal navy frigates.\n4. The article provides information about the Type 22 frigates, including their original design as a specialist anti-submarine ship, their evolution into a powerful surface combatant, and their excellent command and control and communication facilities. The summary does not mention any plans to build a new generation of royal navy frigates.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions plans to build a new generation of royal navy frigates on the Isle of Wight, which is not supported by the article. Therefore, the answer is (no) the summary is not consistent with the article."}
