The summary does not mention any underlying health issues that could have contributed to the horse's death, which is consistent with the article's statement that there were \"no significant underlying health issues\".\n3. The summary does not mention any previous instances of the horse showing symptoms of post-race ataxia, which is consistent with the article's statement that the horse had shown no symptoms of post-race ataxia on Saturday.\n4. The summary does not suggest that the horse's death was linked to a pre-existing condition, such as a tendency to overheat, which is consistent with the article's conclusion that the horse was the victim of a rare hemorrhage.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is consistent with the article in its presentation of the facts surrounding the horse's death.
