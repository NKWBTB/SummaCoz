Here's why:\n\n1. The article mentions that the testimonial game will be available to 1.7 billion people worldwide via Rooney's and Manchester United's Facebook pages. The summary also mentions that Rooney has become the first player to play in Manchester United's match against Manchester United on Saturday, which suggests that the game will be streamed globally.\n2. The article states that proceeds from the game will be distributed to Rooney's four chosen charities. The summary does not mention anything about charities, but it does mention that Rooney is delighted that the game will be streamed globally, which suggests that he is happy that the game will raise awareness and increase donations.\n3. The article mentions that the game at Old Trafford will mark Rooney's 12 years of service at Manchester United. The summary does not mention anything about Rooney's service at Manchester United.\n4. The article mentions that Jose Mourinho's three summer signings, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, and Eric Bailly, are expected to make their first home appearances in the game. The summary does not mention anything about Mourinho's signings or their expected appearances in the game.\n5. The article mentions that Manchester United's Facebook page has more than 70 million likes, while Rooney's page has more than 25 million likes. The summary does not mention anything about the number of likes on either page.\n\nBased on these comparisons, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains several inaccuracies and omissions that are not present in the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (no)."}
