Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Northumberland County Council is planning to repair 145 potholes each day over the next four months. The summary also mentions \"repairs have been carried out\" to a major drainage system, which suggests that the council is actively working on addressing road damage caused by heavy rain.\n2. The article states that the council will be using Jetpatcher machines to tackle the holes, which is consistent with the summary's mention of \"repairs have been carried out.\"\n3. The article does not mention anything about a major drainage system being damaged in the UK for the first time. While the summary makes this claim, there is no evidence in the article to support it.\n\nBased on these points, I conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains additional information that is not present in the article, and it makes a claim that is not supported by the article's content. Therefore, the answer is (no) the summary is not consistent with the article."}
