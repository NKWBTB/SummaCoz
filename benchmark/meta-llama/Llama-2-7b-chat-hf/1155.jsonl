Here's why:\n\n1. The article is about the importance of protecting key transport routes, such as the Panama Canal, Suez Canal, and Turkish Straits, due to their role in global food trade. The summary, on the other hand, mentions nothing about the US or climate change.\n2. The article highlights the vulnerability of food supply and prices to unforeseen crises or climate change, and urges governments to invest in \"climate-resilient\" infrastructure and diversify food production and stocks. The summary does not mention anything about food security or climate change.\n3. The article quotes an author of the study, Laura Wellesley, who explains that there are risks for both the food security of importing countries and the economies of those exporting food due to climate change. The summary does not include any quotes or information from the article.\n\nBased on these discrepancies, I would answer (no) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
