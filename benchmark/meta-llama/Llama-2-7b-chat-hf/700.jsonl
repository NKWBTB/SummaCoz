The summary implies that thousands of unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton due to a shortage of landlords.\n2. However, the article does not support the idea that unlicensed landlords are being forced to enter their homes.

It mentions concerns of tenants, but it doesn't state that landlords are being forced to live in their own properties.\n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"thousands of unlicensed landlords\" which is supported by the article when it states that the council estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area.\n2. The summary states that landlords are being forced to enter their homes in Southampton due to a shortage of landlords, which is also supported by the article when it mentions that a small minority of landlords have resisted applying for their licence.\n3. The article mentions that mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people, which is consistent with the summary's mention of \"HMOs\" without specifying any specific requirements.\n4. The article does not mention any specific fines or penalties for unlicensed landlords, but the summary does mention a fine of up to \u00a320,000, which is consistent with the article's mention of the council gaining prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals.\n\nBased on the above, the summary is consistent with the article in terms of the information it provides and the tone it takes. Therefore, the answer is (yes) the summary is consistent with the article."}
