The summary implies that a fire that destroyed a disused waste site in Eamonn, County Down, is to be investigated by the Environment Agency.\n2. However, the article discusses a fire in Duncan Street, Greater Manchester, and actions taken by the Environment Agency (EA) and the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS). There is no mention of Eamonn, County Down, in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary makes by referencing a different location (Eamonn, County Down) that is not mentioned in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the location of the fire as \"Eamonn, county down,\" which is the same location mentioned in the article as the site where the fire occurred.\n2. The summary states that the fire destroyed a disused waste site, which is consistent with the article's mention of a fire at a site in Duncan Street that reduced train services and caused travel delays.\n3. The summary mentions the Environment Agency (EA) taking enforcement action against the site operators, which is consistent with the article's mention of the EA suspending Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.\n4. The summary quotes Geoff Harris, the area manager of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS), as saying that the site operators have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation, which is consistent with the article's mention of the fire service raising concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport, and the environment.\n5. The summary mentions the EA revoking the environmental permit of the site operators, which is consistent with the article's mention of the EA deciding to revoke the environmental permit of Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited.\n\nBased on these similarities, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
