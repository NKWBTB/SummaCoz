Instead, it discusses the proposal to pardon men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, including living gay and bisexual men.\n3.

The article states that \"the motion in the assembly is expected to contain the same provisions and allow for pardons both posthumously as well as for living gay and bisexual men.\" This means that the legislation being proposed in the assembly would allow for pardons for both posthumously and living gay and bisexual men, which is consistent with the summary.\n3. The article also states that \"Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval.\" This confirms that the motion being proposed in the assembly has been confirmed by the Justice Minister, which is consistent with the summary.\n4. The summary does not mention any other provisions or details that are not present in the article.\n\nBased on the above, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
