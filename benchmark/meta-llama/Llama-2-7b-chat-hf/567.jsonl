The summary states that a man is in a critical condition in hospital after being shot in the head in north Belfast.\n2. However, the article provides details of a different incident, which occurred in Sheffield, not in north Belfast. It describes a fatal shooting incident outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, Sheffield, where a man was fatally injured with a gunshot wound to his chest. It also mentions other recent shooting incidents in Sheffield, which are unrelated to the Belfast location.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary reports a completely different shooting incident in a different location (north Belfast) that is not related to the Sheffield incident described in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:\n\n1. Location: The article mentions the location of the shooting as Upperthorpe, Sheffield, which matches the location provided in the summary.\n2. Victim: The article identifies the victim as a man who was shot outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, which matches the victim's identity mentioned in the summary.\n3. Injury: The article states that the victim was shot in the chest, and the summary mentions that the man was in a critical condition after being shot in the head, which suggests that the same person was injured in both incidents.\n4. Time of incident: The article mentions that the shooting occurred at around 13:35 GMT, and the summary does not provide a different time for the incident.\n5. Number of incidents: The article mentions that there have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks, but the summary only refers to one incident in north Belfast.\n\nBased on these comparisons, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
