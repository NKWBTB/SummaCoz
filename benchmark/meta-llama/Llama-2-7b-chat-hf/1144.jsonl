The summary states that the EHRC criticized the company for its \"controversial'sexism' campaign\", but the article does not mention a campaign. Instead, it reports on the company's job advertisements that have been criticized for being sexist and discriminatory.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) criticizing Matching Models, which is the main point of the article.\n2. The summary quotes Rebecca Hilsenrath, the chief executive of the EHRC, saying that the agency's hiring practices are \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women.\" This is consistent with the article, which quotes Hilsenrath as saying that the agency's ads are \"straight out of the 1970s\" and that it would be writing to the agency to clarify its hiring practices.\n3. The summary mentions women's equality campaigners saying that the agency's ads are \"straight out of the 1970s,\" which is consistent with the article, which quotes Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, saying that the ads are \"extraordinary\" and \"almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation.\"\n4. The summary mentions the agency's founder, Nathalie Jansen, saying that the agency's clients are important to them, and that looks are important. This is consistent with the article, which quotes Jansen as saying that the agency's clients include high-end brands like Louis Vuitton and Harrods, and that they have hired 5,000 people worldwide.\n5. The summary mentions employment lawyer James Lynas saying that the advert for a \"sexy female driver\" is \"clearly unlawful,\" and that anyone could complain to the EHRC. This is consistent with the article, which quotes Lynas as saying that the use of phrases like \"beautiful and attractive\" are code for \"young\" and could be seen as discriminatory against older women.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately represents the main points of the article, including the EHRC's criticism of Matching Models and the agency's controversial hiring practices. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
