Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the location of the article, which is Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. The article also mentions the location of the small market town of Korem, which is north of Addis Ababa.\n2. The summary talks about the empty ward in the local hospital reserved for severely malnourished babies. The article also mentions the same ward, stating that it is almost empty due to the success of foreign aid in reducing child mortality.\n3. The summary mentions the growth of Ethiopia's economy, which has been growing at close to 10% a year for a decade. The article also provides data on Ethiopia's economic growth, including a 10.5% growth rate in 2013.\n4. The summary mentions the number of child deaths per 1,000 in 1984 and 2013, which has decreased significantly from 227 to 64. The article also provides data on child mortality rates, which have come down by two-thirds in the last five years.\n5. The summary mentions the focus on improving local tax collection and fighting illicit capital flight across Africa. The article also discusses the challenges ahead for Ethiopia, including the need to address issues of governance and human rights while continuing to achieve economic growth.\n\nBased on these similarities, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the article.
