The summary states that the rate of poverty in the US has fallen to its lowest level since 2011, which is consistent with the article's statement that the poverty rate was 15% in 2011 and stayed flat after three previous years of increases.\n2. The summary does not mention any increase in real median income of households, which is consistent with the article's statement that real median income of households in the country dropped by 1.5%.\n3. The summary does not mention the average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011, which is consistent with the article's lack of mention of this information.\n4. The summary does mention an increase in income inequality, measured by the Gini index, which is consistent with the article's statement that income inequality increased by 1.6% in 2011, the first time there has been an annual rise in the index since 1993.\n5. The summary does not mention the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance, which is consistent with the article's lack of mention of this information.\n6. The summary states that poverty in the US reached a record high in 2010, which is consistent with the article's statement that poverty in the US reached a record high in 2010, at 15.1%.\n\nBased on these comparisons, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
