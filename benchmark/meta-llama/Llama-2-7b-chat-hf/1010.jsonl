Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that concerns over job losses at the DVLA were raised after Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement in October 2014, where he announced the replacement of the tax disc with an electronic system.\n2. The article quotes Stephen Hammond, the Finance Minister, as saying in a letter to Mike Hedges, an AM from Swansea East, that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may result in a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received, which may lead to changes in job roles.\n3. The article also quotes Mr. Hammond as saying that any reductions in the number of people needed for these activities will be managed through redeployment to other growth areas of the business.\n4. The summary mentions that workers at the DVLA's car hire centre in Swansea will see redundancies cut in the next two years, which is consistent with the information provided in the article.\n\nTherefore, the summary is consistent with the article as it accurately reflects the information provided in the article."}
