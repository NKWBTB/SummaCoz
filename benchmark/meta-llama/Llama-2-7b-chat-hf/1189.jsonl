The summary mentions the use of an app to trigger online information, which is supported by the article as it states that visitors will be able to use an app to access online material, including videos and band interviews.\n2. The article mentions the festival taking place in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis from 19 to 22 July, and the summary does the same.\n3. The article quotes HebCelt director Caroline Maclennan as saying that the festival is offering an augmented reality experience as an extra feature, and the summary mentions that all images are copyrighted. This suggests that the summary is accurately summarizing the information provided in the article.\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, I answer (yes) to the question: Is the summary consistent with the corresponding article?"}
