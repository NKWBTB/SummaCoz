{"document": "An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter. Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama\u2019s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at \u2018the world at large\u2019. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out \u2018blindly\u2019. \u2018He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,\u2019 Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. \u2018He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.\u2019 The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly \u2018beside himself\u2019 with grief. The case is due to return to court on May 18.", "claim": "leon yeaman , 55 , was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker phillip pama , 28 , during a row in front of their north brisbane homes . mr yeaman was reportedly in his yard making a lot of noise at around 9pm thursday night . pama , a married father of three , works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time he was making a commotion .", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "0fa083cb7da10f1f697e7dab6210397f00c0a4cf", "model_name": "bert_sum", "annotations": [1, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "EntE", "doc_sents": ["An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter.", "Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes.", "Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night.", "Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion.", "Pama\u2019s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at \u2018the world at large\u2019.", "Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated.", "Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out \u2018blindly\u2019.", "\u2018He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,\u2019 Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama.", "\u2018He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.\u2019", "The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down", "Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night.", "Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music.", "Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday.", "The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week.", "Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly \u2018beside himself\u2019 with grief.", "The case is due to return to court on May 18."], "sum_sents": ["leon yeaman , 55 , was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker phillip pama , 28 , during a row in front of their north brisbane homes .", "mr yeaman was reportedly in his yard making a lot of noise at around 9pm thursday night .", "pama , a married father of three , works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time he was making a commotion ."], "rel_index": [1, 2, 3, 7], "cot": "1.

Mr. Yeaman was reportedly in his yard making a lot of noise at around 9 pm Thursday night. Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time he was making a commotion.\n2. However, the article states that Mr. Yeaman was the one making a lot of noise in his yard at around 9 pm Thursday night. It was not Phillip Pama who was making the commotion, but Mr. Yeaman. The article doesn't mention Pama making noise; instead, it describes him confronting Mr. Yeaman due to the noise created by the latter.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies Phillip Pama was making a commotion while sleeping, which contradicts the article's information that it was Mr. Yeaman who was making noise in his yard.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the names of the parties involved, including Leon Yeaman and Phillip Pama, which is consistent with the article.\n2. The summary states that the incident occurred in front of their north Brisbane homes, which is consistent with the article's mention of the location of the incident.\n3. The summary mentions that Mr. Yeaman was making a lot of noise at around 9pm on a Thursday night, which is consistent with the article's mention of the time and day of the incident.\n4. The summary states that Pama works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time of the incident, which is consistent with the article's mention of Pama's work schedule and his state of mind at the time of the incident.\n5. The summary mentions that Pama allegedly killed Mr. Yeaman with one punch, which is consistent with the article's mention of Pama's involvement in the incident and the cause of Mr. Yeaman's death.\n6. The summary states that Pama was granted conditional bail on Friday, which is consistent with the article's mention of the bail application and the outcome.\n\nBased on these points, I conclude that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
