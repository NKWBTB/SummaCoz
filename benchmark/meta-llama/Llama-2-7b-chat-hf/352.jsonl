To most of the outside world, this war-torn country is off limits, the weeks-long battle between Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces making it too dangerous to visit, and a no-fly zone rendering its international airport all but obsolete -- but on Tuesday, CNN was granted rare access on a desperate aid mission by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. The airport has previously been bombed. Hostilities are likely to resume before the day is out: a brief, peaceful window has been delicately negotiated following a special request from the U.N. -- but it won't last long. Unicef hopes there will be just enough time to deliver vital food and supplies, helping to ease the country's worsening humanitarian crisis. More than 100,000 Yemeni civilians have fled their homes since fighting began, and OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, estimates that 15.9 million people here are in need of assistance. The main terminal at El Rahaba Airport is under the control of the Houthi rebels. We can't get near it for fear of provoking trouble. But there is plenty to be done out on the tarmac. Within minutes of touching down, a small army of aid workers is busy unloading huge mounds of much-needed provisions. Gusts of wind blow dust across the runway, as crates and pallets of emergency nutrition and medical equipment pile up rapidly beside the plane. Unicef's team has overcome more than one hurdle just getting it this far -- now they'll have to work out how to distribute it to those most in need in a country paralyzed by a lack of resources. Even before Saudi airstrikes, most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs, according to the United Nations. As they work, an Air India plane is taxiing away from the terminal. Thousands have fled the country on evacuation flights in recent weeks as the situation in Yemen has deteriorated. But for those who have nowhere else to go and no chance of a flight out, mercy missions by Unicef and other NGOs like it are the only hope.

The article states \"but on Tuesday, CNN was granted rare access on a desperate aid mission by Unicef\".\n3.

Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"houthi rebels and saudi-led coalition forces\" as the parties responsible for the conflict in Yemen, which is consistent with the article's mention of \"Houthi rebels and Saudi-led coalition forces\" as the main actors in the conflict.\n2. The summary notes that the country is \"off limits\" due to the conflict, which is supported by the article's mention of the \"weeks-long battle\" and the \"no-fly zone\" that has made it difficult for outsiders to access the country.\n3. The summary mentions \"aid workers\" unloading supplies at the airport, which is consistent with the article's description of Unicef's team working on the tarmac to distribute aid to those in need.\n4. The summary notes that the situation in Yemen has deteriorated, leading to a humanitarian crisis, which is supported by the article's mention of the \"worsening humanitarian crisis\" and the estimate that over 15 million people in Yemen are in need of assistance.\n5. The summary mentions \"mercy missions\" by organizations like Unicef, which is consistent with the article's mention of Unicef's desperate aid mission to deliver vital food and supplies to those in need.\n\nOverall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, including the causes and consequences of the conflict in Yemen, the challenges faced by aid workers, and the humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the conflict. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
