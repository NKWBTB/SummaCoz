Joanne Baker, 31, and Gayle Smart, 37, were both left with deep scars above their\u00a0eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub. They believe someone smashed their heads together as they stood\u00a0outside the Rose and Crown on Newgate Street. Friends Gayle Smart (pictured left) and Joanne Baker (right) were both left with horrific injuries and deep scars above their eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub . But police say they are satisfied no crime has been committed. The women had gone out for drinks in the city centre on Friday night with Ms Baker's boyfriend John Burton, 26, when they ended up at the Rose and Crown. 'We had been in the pub then we went outside then the next thing I remember\u00a0is our heads were banged together,' said Ms Baker. Ms Smart, a waitress, added: 'As far as I can remember I was just\u00a0outside having a cigarette and our heads were just smashed together.' Gayle Smart (left) and Joanne Baker (right) believe someone smashed their heads together outside the pub . The incident took place outside the Rose and Crown pub in Newcastle (pictured) Neither realised how seriously injured they were until\u00a0they looked at one another's faces. Ms Baker said: 'I just saw Gayle's face and I was more\u00a0concerned about her. But she was looking at me and asking me\u00a0if I was OK.' Mr Burton ran to a nearby Greggs shop to get tissues to stem\u00a0the women's bleeding and police and paramedics arrived at the scene. Ms Smart,\u00a0who lives in Bensham, Gateshead, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary\u00a0by ambulance, while Ms Baker got a taxi back to her home in North Shields. Mother-of-two Ms Baker (pictured) said she had to tell her daughter her injury was fancy dress because the little girl was so shocked at her appearance . When she arrived home she discovered the true extent of her injuries and went to North\u00a0Tyneside General Hospital. 'When I got home I was really shocked,' Ms Baker said. 'The cut was so deep I\u00a0had to have internal stitches and eight external stitches.' The mother-of-two said: 'When my kids saw it they nearly passed out. I had to tell my daughter it was fancy dress because she was so shocked.' Mother-of-two Ms Smart said she now has to put up with awkward questions and curious\u00a0looks from customers at the pub where she works. The pair say they believe\u00a0someone deliberately banged their heads together but police say they can\u00a0find no evidence of a crime being committed. Ms Baker said: 'I'm going to be scarred for life. I just can't believe\u00a0all this has happened just from going to a bar. It just doesn't make sense. Ms Smart added: 'There was blood smeared across my forehead. When I\u00a0saw it I was in shock. And now it's going to scar.' A Northumbria Police spokeswoman said: 'Police were informed of a\u00a0disturbance in Newcastle city centre at around 8.35pm on Friday. 'Two women\u00a0suffered facial injuries. Officers attended and inquiries were carried out\u00a0and it was established no offences were committed. Suitable advice was\u00a0given to both parties.' Both women say they have been put off nights out in Newcastle city centre and  won't be returning.", "claim": "they believe someone smashed their heads together as they stood outside the rose.", "cnndm_id": "84d03301bfc126b975e622bf62153472ade153c2", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["Two mothers who went on a night out have been left with matching scars after suffering horrific injuries when their heads were 'banged together' outside a city centre pub.", "Joanne Baker, 31, and Gayle Smart, 37, were both left with deep scars above their\u00a0eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub.", "They believe someone smashed their heads together as they stood\u00a0outside the Rose and Crown on Newgate Street.", "Friends Gayle Smart (pictured left) and Joanne Baker (right) were both left with horrific injuries and deep scars above their eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub .", "But police say they are satisfied no crime has been committed.", "The women had gone out for drinks in the city centre on Friday night with Ms Baker's boyfriend John Burton, 26, when they ended up at the Rose and Crown.", "'We had been in the pub then we went outside then the next thing I remember\u00a0is our heads were banged together,' said Ms Baker.", "Ms Smart, a waitress, added: 'As far as I can remember I was just\u00a0outside having a cigarette and our heads were just smashed together.'", "Gayle Smart (left) and Joanne Baker (right) believe someone smashed their heads together outside the pub .", "The incident took place outside the Rose and Crown pub in Newcastle (pictured)", "Neither realised how seriously injured they were until\u00a0they looked at one another's faces.", "Ms Baker said: 'I just saw Gayle's face and I was more\u00a0concerned about her.", "But she was looking at me and asking me\u00a0if I was OK.'", "Mr Burton ran to a nearby Greggs shop to get tissues to stem\u00a0the women's bleeding and police and paramedics arrived at the scene.", "Ms Smart,\u00a0who lives in Bensham, Gateshead, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary\u00a0by ambulance, while Ms Baker got a taxi back to her home in North Shields.", "Mother-of-two Ms Baker (pictured) said she had to tell her daughter her injury was fancy dress because the little girl was so shocked at her appearance .", "When she arrived home she discovered the true extent of her injuries and went to North\u00a0Tyneside General Hospital.", "'When I got home I was really shocked,' Ms Baker said.", "'The cut was so deep I\u00a0had to have internal stitches and eight external stitches.'", "The mother-of-two said: 'When my kids saw it they nearly passed out.", "I had to tell my daughter it was fancy dress because she was so shocked.'", "Mother-of-two Ms Smart said she now has to put up with awkward questions and curious\u00a0looks from customers at the pub where she works.", "The pair say they believe\u00a0someone deliberately banged their heads together but police say they can\u00a0find no evidence of a crime being committed.", "Ms Baker said: 'I'm going to be scarred for life.", "I just can't believe\u00a0all this has happened just from going to a bar.", "It just doesn't make sense.", "Ms Smart added: 'There was blood smeared across my forehead.", "When I\u00a0saw it I was in shock.", "And now it's going to scar.'", "A Northumbria Police spokeswoman said: 'Police were informed of a\u00a0disturbance in Newcastle city centre at around 8.35pm on Friday.", "'Two women\u00a0suffered facial injuries.", "Officers attended and inquiries were carried out\u00a0and it was established no offences were committed.", "Suitable advice was\u00a0given to both parties.'", "Both women say they have been put off nights out in Newcastle city centre and  won't be returning."], "sum_sents": ["they believe someone smashed their heads together as they stood outside the rose."], "rel_index": [2], "cot": "1.
