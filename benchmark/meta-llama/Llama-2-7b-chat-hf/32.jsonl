Following the birth of Prince George, the Prince of Wales described the experience of becoming a first-time grandfather as \u2018a unique moment in anyone\u2019s life\u2019. But nearly two years after this very public display of affection, Charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young Prince\u2019s life. At the heart of the heir-to-the-throne\u2019s frustrations is the so-called \u2018Middletonisation\u2019 of his son William\u2019s life \u2014 specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in-laws Michael and Carole, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole\u2019s 60th. In fact, so vexed is Charles about the so-called \u2018March of the Middletons\u2019 that he has complained to friends: \u2018They never let me see my grandson.\u2019 Adds a source: \u2018Carole has rather taken over, dictating when George naps, when and what he eats. All in all, behaving like she\u2019s Queen Carole.\u2019 It is certainly true there have been few, if any, trips to Charles\u2019s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over the past year. Some think it\u2019s a deliberate move on William\u2019s part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff, and often unhappy, upbringing he endured. Certainly, Carole, who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house, is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with Charles\u2019s wife, Camilla. Most of William and Kate\u2019s time is spent at their Norfolk home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate, where the Prince has been busy revising for his Air Transport Pilot\u2019s Licence. The Middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household. They stayed there over Christmas, when William pointedly hosted lunch for them on Christmas Day rather than eat with the Queen, as is traditional. Last month, it emerged that William\u2019s housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at Anmer. Scroll down for video .
