Instead, it describes the events of the match, including the goals scored by other players and the final result being a draw (1-1).\n3.

The summary mentions the goalscorers, which is consistent with the article. The article mentions Nathan Delfouneso and Jamille Matt as the goalscorers for Blackpool, and Kurtis Guthrie for Colchester United.\n3.
