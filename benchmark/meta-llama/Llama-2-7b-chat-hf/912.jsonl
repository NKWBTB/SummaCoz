{"document": "Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions the same incident as the article, specifically the rescue of 8,480 migrants from Africa and the Middle East during the first weekend of April. The article also reports on this incident, stating that the Italian coast guard rescued 8,480 migrants from Friday to Monday.\n2. The summary mentions the same concern as the article, which is the possible fate of 400 missing migrants. The article quotes a spokesman for Save the Children as saying that the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, tells CNN that it has not found any evidence to confirm such an incident.\n3. The summary and the article both mention the same location where the migrants are attempting to reach, which is Italy. The article states that the migrants are attempting to make it to Europe, specifically Italy, and the summary mentions the Mediterranean Sea as the location where the migrants are crossing.\n4. The summary and the article both mention the same cause of death for the migrants, which is bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers. The article states that at least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers.\n\nBased on these similarities, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Therefore, I answer (yes) to the question."}
