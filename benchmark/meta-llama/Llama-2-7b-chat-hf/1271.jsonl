Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions the year 2016, while the summary does not. This suggests that the summary is not based on the article, as the article was published in 2016, but the summary does not provide a specific year.\n2. The article mentions the location of the study site as South Beach in the bay, while the summary does not. The article provides a specific location, which is consistent with the information provided in the article.\n3. The article mentions the number of seahorses recorded on the study site in 2008, which is 40. The summary does not provide any information about the number of seahorses spotted.\n4. The article mentions the name of the investigator, Miranda Krestovnikoff, and the organizations she is affiliated with, while the summary does not. This suggests that the summary is not based on the article, as the article provides the name of the investigator and the organizations she is affiliated with.\n5. The article does not mention anything about a girl being spotted on a yacht in the north sea. The summary provides this information, which is not supported by the article.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
