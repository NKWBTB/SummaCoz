Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"the rubber insulation between the submarine's light and pressure hull is on fire,\" which is directly quoted from Russia's RIA Novosti news agency. This information is supported by the article, which states that the fire began on a sub in the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia, and that the rubber insulation between the submarine's light and pressure hull is on fire.\n2. The summary also mentions that \"Nuclear fuel from the sub's reactor has been unloaded,\" which is supported by the article. According to the article, the sub had been undergoing repairs since November 2013, and that the nuclear fuel from the sub's reactor had been unloaded.\n3. The summary does not mention any information that is not supported by the article. For example, the summary does not mention the cause of the fire, which is not specified in the article.\n\nBased on the above, I can confidently say that the summary is consistent with the article. Yes, the summary is consistent with the article."}
