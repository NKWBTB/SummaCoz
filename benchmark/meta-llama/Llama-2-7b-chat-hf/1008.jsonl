The summary highlights the potential of the region to become a \"region of distilling excellence,\" which is consistent with the lead distiller's statement in the article about the region's rich abundance of wild food and the distillery's aim to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour palette and \"terroir.\"\n3.
