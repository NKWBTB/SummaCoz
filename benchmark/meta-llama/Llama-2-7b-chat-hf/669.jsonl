The summary implies that a prison in Essex is \"frightened\" after reports of people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. While the article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the prison wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, it does not mention the prison itself being \"frightened\" or people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which introduces a statement not found in the article and misrepresents the prison's reaction to the reported incidents.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf": "  Yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. Here's why:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"reports of people being thrown into a prison by drones in Essex,\" which is the same issue addressed in the article. The article specifically mentions the Chelmsford Prison in Essex, where there have been incidents of packages being hurled over the wall, and the use of drones to smuggle contraband into the prison.\n2. The summary uses similar language to the article, such as \"frightened\" and \"notorious,\" which are also used in the article to describe the situation at the Chelmsford Prison.\n3. The summary mentions \"drones\" as the means of smuggling contraband into the prison, which is also mentioned in the article as a method used by drug smugglers to get packages into the prison.\n4. The summary does not introduce any new information or claims that are not supported by the article.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the corresponding article."}
