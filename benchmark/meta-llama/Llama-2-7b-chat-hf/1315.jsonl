Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The summary mentions \"victory over bottom side Ayr United,\" which is consistent with the article's mention of \"Pars goalkeeper Sean Murdoch denied Jamie Adams in a first half of few chances before two quick fire goals put the visitors in control.\" This suggests that the game was played between Ayr United and the opposing team, which is consistent with the article's mention of \"Ayr United\" throughout.\n2. The summary mentions \"El Bakhtaoui raced on to a Ryan Wallace ball to score his first, before scoring a stunning 30-yard volley from Michael Paton's cross,\" which is consistent with the article's mention of \"El Bakhtaoui raced on to a Ryan Wallace ball to score his first\" and \"Craig Moore fired a late chance over for Ayr United.\"\n3. The summary does not mention any information that is not present in the article. For example, the article does not mention anything about Ayr United moving to within a point of the Scottish League One play-off places, which is mentioned in the summary.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, I can confidently say that the summary is consistent with the article."}
