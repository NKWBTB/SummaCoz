The summary refers to the RMT union claiming that some workers on board the freight boats were paid less than \u00a34 an hour, which is supported by the article's mention of the RMT union claiming that some workers were paid less than the national minimum wage.\n3. The summary mentions the new charter arrangement that will come into force early next month, which is consistent with the article's mention of a new charter basis that will allow the wage issue to be resolved.\n4. The summary mentions Serco Northlink being awarded the six-year \u00a3243m Northern Isles contract in 2012, which is consistent with the article's mention of Serco Northlink operating the service under a six-year contract worth \u00a3243m.\n5. The summary does not mention any information that contradicts the article, such as different numbers or details about the pay and conditions of the crew members.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the summary and the article, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article."}
