The article does not provide any information on the population size or any record highs or lows.\n2. The article does provide information on the poverty rate, which was 15% in 2011, meaning 46.2 million Americans were in poverty. The summary does not mention any change in the poverty rate.\n3. The article also provides information on the real median income of households, which dropped by 1.5%. The summary does not mention anything about median income.\n4. The article mentions the average poverty threshold for a family of four in 2011, which was $23,021 (\u00c2\u00a314,300). The summary does not provide any information on the poverty threshold.\n5. The article states that income inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased by 1.6% in 2011, which is consistent with the summary's mention of a rise in income inequality.\n6. The article also provides information on the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance, which fell to 15.7% from 16.3%. The summary does not mention anything about health insurance.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, and it omits important information that is provided in the article.
