Here's why:\n\n1. The article states that the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva on Wednesday. The summary, on the other hand, claims that Malaysia's aviation authority has decided not to broadcast a satellite tracking system for flight MH370.\n2. The article explains that the current tracking system relies on ground-based radars, which have limitations, and that the new system will enable satellites to receive transmissions from aircraft, allowing for real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world. The summary does not provide any information about the current tracking system or the need for a new system.\n3. The article quotes ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao as saying that the agency had \"responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.\" The summary does not mention any response from Malaysia's aviation authority.\n4. The article provides details about the conference where the decision was taken and the new tracking guidelines set by the UN's aviation arm, ICAO. The summary does not provide any information about the conference or the new guidelines.\n\nBased on the above discrepancies, it is clear that the summary is inconsistent with the corresponding article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes)."}
