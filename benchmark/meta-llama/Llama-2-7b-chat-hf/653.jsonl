Here's why:\n\n1. The article is about a 10-year-old Irish-bred horse that collapsed and died after winning a race at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. The summary, on the other hand, mentions an 11-year-old boy who died after falling from a balcony at Cheltenham. These are two completely different incidents.\n2. The article specifically states that the horse had no significant underlying health issues, whereas the summary does not provide any information about the boy's health.\n3. The article quotes Tony Welsh, acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, as saying that episodes like this are rare and can occur in horses with no underlying health issues. The summary does not include any quotes or information from a veterinary expert.\n4. The article provides details about the horse's past performances and its trainer's comments, whereas the summary does not include any information about the boy's background or the circumstances surrounding his death.\n\nBased on these differences, it is clear that the summary is inconsistent with the article."}
