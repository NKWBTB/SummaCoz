The summary mentions that a horse has died after suffering severe brain injuries in a horse race at the Cheltenham Festival, which is consistent with the article's mention of the horse collapsing and suffering from a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage\".\n2. The summary does not mention any underlying health issues that could have contributed to the horse's death, which is consistent with the article's statement that there were \"no significant underlying health issues\".\n3.
