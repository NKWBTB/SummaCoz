When we reached our rooms, we hide under the beds.\"\nShe said that their pursuers told them to come out of their hiding places, but she decided to hide in the wardrobe instead where she covered herself with some clothes.\nIt was then that the gunmen entered the room. Ms Cheroitich described a scenario that other survivors have alluded to.\nHer roommates were taken out and divided up between those who were able to recite verses of the Koran and those who were not.\nIt was not clear what happened to them.\nShe said she found some bottles of body lotion where she was hiding and \"drank all of them\", describing it as \"nice and lovely\".\nBut she was too scared to move. \"I was just praying to my God,\" she said.\nIt was not until 10:00 on Saturday, long after the attack ended, that the authorities were able to persuade her to come out.\nShe told AP: \"You know at first I did not believe it [when police came to rescue her], at first I was thinking that maybe they were the al-Shabab.
