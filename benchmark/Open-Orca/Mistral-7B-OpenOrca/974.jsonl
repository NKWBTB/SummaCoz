{"document": "It's crunch time this weekend at the top of the Premier League as second-placed Arsenal host table toppers Chelsea - and it appears one star of the former's team cannot wait for the ever-nearing kick-off. Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch. The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from \u00a3299 to \u00a313,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon. Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil (right) took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday . Ozil compared his watch to TV character Michael Knight in the hit action show Knight Rider . Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift, comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider. Accompanied with the caption: 'Excited about my new cool gadget! It's just like Michael Knight's watch, but a real one #knightrider #phone,' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday. The midfielder, who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season, is expected to start for Arsene Wenger's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Arsenal trail the Blues by 10 points with six league games remaining - but have been boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere. Wilshere was on the bench in their FA Cup semi-final win over Reading at Wembley on April 18 after five months out through injury. And club legend Ray Parlour believes that the 23-year-old\u2019s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield. \u2018I think he\u2019s the future of the club,\u2019 said Parlour. \u2018I think if he stays fit, he\u2019s a quality player, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Jack Wilshere (centre) was on the bench for Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading . Ray Parlour, who won three championships with Arsenal, has backed Wilshere to be the future of the club . \u2018The way he goes past players, the way he links up with people, I definitely think he\u2019s got a big role to play. \u2018But again, the big question mark is can he stay fit? Look at Abou Diaby. Diaby\u2019s a terrific player. But look at him, the injuries the last few years. \u2018The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period, like he hasn\u2019t had for the last three or four seasons.\u2019 Wilshere, the England international, is pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week .", "claim": "Parlour says the 23-year-old's fitness record is the one thing holding Wilshere back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield 'He's a very good player, he's a very technically gifted player and he's got a great attitude.
