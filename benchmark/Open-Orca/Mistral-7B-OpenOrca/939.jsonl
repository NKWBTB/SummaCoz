The German star was in fine form as the World Cup winners beat Georgia 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday, and is now setting his sights on the Premier League encounter with Liverpool at the weekend. And Ozil gave an insight into what he does in his downtime after taking a snap of him playing with his pet with the caption: 'Home Sweet Home'. Mesut Ozil posted a picture on Twitter relaxing with his dog on Wednesday after returning home to London . Ozil impressed on international duty as Germany beat Gerogia 2-0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday . The midfielder, who was signed for \u00a342.5million from Real Madrid in 2013, missed Arsenal's last game against Newcastle through illness, but will be expected to start against Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium. Ozil was said to have been spotted in a Berlin nightclub after missing the Gunners' 2-1 win at St James' Park, though manager Arsene Wenger rubbished those claims. He has been doing the business on the pitch after returning from injury though, \u00a0wracking up four assists and scoring three goals since January. And the former Schalke man says he is finally adjusting to English football, claiming he fits in 'perfectly'. 'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.'
