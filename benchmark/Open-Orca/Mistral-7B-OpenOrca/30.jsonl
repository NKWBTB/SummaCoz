Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far \u2014 and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship \u2014 Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . \u2018Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,\u2019 said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. \u2018Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. \u2018At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. \u2018We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.\u2019 Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker\u00a0Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England\u2019s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster\u2019s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England\u2019s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: \u2018We don\u2019t control it. It\u2019s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.\u2019 England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . England practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle . Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship\u2019s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born. His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England\u2019s chances, despite Saturday\u2019s missed opportunities. Captain Chris Robshaw knows his side face a tough test against the French if they want to claim a crucial win . England duo Richard Wigglesworth (left) and Robshaw will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy . \u2018It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,\u2019 he said. \u2018We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress. \u2018We\u2019re happy with what we have created. Now it is just a case of doing the last bit. The easier bit is the finishing. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll work on.
