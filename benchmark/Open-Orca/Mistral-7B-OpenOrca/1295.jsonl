{"document": "Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday, with almost 10% of pupils failing to reach the academy's standards.\nAngry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures.\nBut Hanson Academy claims it \"communicated clearly\" its expectations for this school year.\nPupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers.\nStudents are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed.\nPrincipal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday.\nShe said in an earlier statement: \"We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.\n\"As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.\n\"They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn.\"\nThe principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for \"adult life\".\nShe said: \"This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect.\n\"Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other.\n\"It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school.\"\nCaren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes.\nShe said: \"It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled.
