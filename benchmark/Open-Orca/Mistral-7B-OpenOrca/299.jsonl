Kirsty Jarvis said 11-year-old Freya has been looking forward to moving up to secondary school in September. But they have been left \u2018shocked and upset\u2019 by the decision by council admissions officers to give her a place at the Khalsa Secondary Academy, despite it not being named as one of her preferred choices. Khalsa Secondary Academy, where\u00a0Kirsty Jarvis does not want her 11-year-old daughter Freya to go as she would be a 'minority' The Sikh faith school opened in the village of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, last September despite protests from residents. Mrs Jarvis, who lives in the nearby village of Farnham Royal, said most of Freya\u2019s friends have been allocated places at a school in the town of Beaconsfield. \u2018We\u2019re a practising Christian family and while we aren\u2019t wanting her to go to a Christian school, my daughter should not be expected to attend a Sikh school,\u2019 said Mrs Jarvis. \u2018We knew we were ever so slightly out of the catchment for a number of our first choices but we never thought we would be given Khalsa. \u2018In this day and age I could not imagine ever sending my child to a school where she would become a minority. 'Although it\u2019s open to all, each day they take students off for morning prayers and my daughter would not be doing that, and she would, therefore, be taken out and isolated. I\u2019m not sure she would be able to cope with that.\u2019 St Giles Church in Stoke Poges. Khalsa Secondary Academy opened in the village in September . Khalsa Secondary Academy opened with 180 pupils, and aims to build up to 850. The school intends to cater for students from all backgrounds, with \u201850 per cent of places prioritised for non-Sikh students\u2019. Plans to open the school were put forward by Slough Sikh Education Trust in 2013. Khalsa Primary School was already open in Slough, which is just across the border in Berkshire and has a large Sikh population. But the trust said there was no suitable site for the new school in Slough. There was a legal battle over the plans to open the school after people in Stoke Poges protested, saying they were worried about extra traffic and the \u2018urbanisation\u2019 of their village. A Buckinghamshire County Council spokesman said: \u2018Where we can\u2019t meet any of a parent\u2019s preferences, then the nearest school is allocated. \u2018In Mrs Jarvis\u2019s case, Khalsa Academy is the nearest school at 1.771 miles away, although Burnham Park E-Act Academy is the catchment school where there are still places.
