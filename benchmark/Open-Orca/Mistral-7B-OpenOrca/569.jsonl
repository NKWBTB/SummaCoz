The summary states that a 23-year-old man has died after a shooting outside a house in Sheffield.\n2. However, the article provides different information. It mentions that the victim was fatally injured outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, Sheffield, but it does not specify the age of the victim. The article provides details about the location of the incident, the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and other incidents in Sheffield but does not mention the victim's age.\n3. The inconsistency arises from the error in the summary, which inaccurately states the age of the victim as 23 years old and specifies that the shooting occurred outside a house, while the article provides a more general description of the location without mentioning the victim's age.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca": " Step 1: Identify the main subject of the article - a fatal shooting incident in Sheffield.\nStep 2: Identify the victim's age - 23 years old.\nStep 3: Identify the location of the incident - outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe.\nStep 4: Identify the circumstances of the shooting - the man was either in or close to a black Mercedes car when he was shot.\nStep 5: Identify the response of the authorities - officers were called to the scene, armed police sealed off the area, and the victim was taken to Northern General hospital.\nStep 6: Identify the outcome of the incident - the victim died from his injuries.\nStep 7: Identify any additional information - the man was a member of a family who live close to the scene of the shooting, and there have been a number of shootings in Sheffield in recent weeks.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. So, the answer is yes."}
