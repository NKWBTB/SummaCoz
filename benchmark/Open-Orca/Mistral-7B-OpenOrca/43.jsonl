Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.' He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties. If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.' At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot . Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari . The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week .

'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop. It is absolutely appalling', he said. 'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead. 'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road. 'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless. 'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released. 'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his earlies twenties, slim, with receding black hair. 'He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue top with a hood.'
