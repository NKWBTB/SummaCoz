The summary only mentions Keatings joining Torquay United.\n\nStep 5: Check if the summary provides information about the players' roles - The article mentions that Anderson is a center-back and Keating is a striker. The summary does not mention this information.\n\nStep 6: Check if the summary provides information about the manager's opinion on the players - The article mentions that the Gulls boss, Kevin Nicholson, is excited about the addition of Keating and describes him as a leader-type and a young, hungry player.
