A young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn (pictured) has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life . The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child . 'I am scared for my future relationships,' the young woman said, according to News Corp. 'He has stolen my right to share my body with someone for the first time.' Van Ryn sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong. 'I didn't understand why he would do something like this. Does this happen to every kid? Do friends do this to other friends?' she said. 'I didn't know it was against the law.' Van Ryn (left) sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong . She said she hadn't spoken up about the abuse until the day she heard he had been caught, and since then had attempted to take her own life. 'I knew I had to say something.' Since then, however, she says she has been scared people will find out. 'I didn't want people to know what happened to me. I don't want people asking questions. She says she wonders when Van Ryn, who is now in custody will be out in the community again, and she worries what he did to her will forever affect how she relates to men. She said she has suffered depression since she was 14 and had been hospitalised for self harm and attempted suicide. The hearing continues.
