The summary implies that a teacher has been suspended from the profession for taking part in a special program for sex offenders in Dumfries and Galloway.\n2. However, the article does not mention the teacher taking part in a special program in Dumfries and Galloway. It discusses how the teacher, Timothy Geaney, admitted to taking or permitting explicit images of children to be taken between 2004 and 2014. He received a community payback order, was placed on the sex offenders register, and was removed from the teaching profession's register following a General Teaching Council Scotland hearing.\n3.
