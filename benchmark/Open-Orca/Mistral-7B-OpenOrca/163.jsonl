Kai Hibbard worked on her book 'Too Fat, Too Thin, Can't Win' with Deborah Baer, according to the New York Daily News. Hibbard's book will reportedly detail what happens behind the scenes of 'The Biggest Loser,' which has aired for 16 seasons. Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season. Speaking out: Kai Hibbard (seen left and right)\u00a0has reportedly penned an expose on'The Biggest Loser.' Hibbard\u00a0finished as the runner-up during the show's third season . A source in the book industry told the Daily News 'The show didn't invent fat-shaming, but exploits it. Her proposal was so juicy. It has a bigger, more important message about weight and health.' According to the newspaper, Hibbard's book claims that 'The Biggest Loser' refused to purchase new underwear for contestants, whose underwear drooped as the pounds came off. The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct. I hope more than a \"tell all\" that when all is said and done it stands as a statement on the media, society and how shame is not a motivator but a paralytic from someone who has regretfully been there and done that.' Remarks: Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster' Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment. She recently told the\u00a0New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I\u2019m embarrassed to have participated in.' She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, \"You\u2019re going die before your children grow up.\" \"You\u2019re going to die, just like your mother.\" \"We\u2019ve picked out your fat-person coffin\" - that was in a text message. One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised. The consistent \"Biggest Loser\" health transformations of over 300 contestants through 16 seasons of the program speak for themselves.'", "claim": "kai hibbard worked on her book 'too fat' with deborah baer. hibbard finished the runner-up during the show's third season. hibbard finished as the runner-up in the show's third season. hibbard has penned an expose on'the biggest loser. a woman who appeared on nbc's weight-loss competition 'the biggest loser'", "cnndm_id": "76d987422b32a692819e6e967317de6a95dd6371", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["A woman who appeared on NBC's weight-loss competition 'The Biggest Loser' has reportedly penned an expose on the hit reality show program.", "Kai Hibbard worked on her book 'Too Fat, Too Thin, Can't Win' with Deborah Baer, according to the New York Daily News.", "Hibbard's book will reportedly detail what happens behind the scenes of 'The Biggest Loser,' which has aired for 16 seasons.", "Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season.", "Speaking out: Kai Hibbard (seen left and right)\u00a0has reportedly penned an expose on'The Biggest Loser.'", "Hibbard\u00a0finished as the runner-up during the show's third season .", "A source in the book industry told the Daily News 'The show didn't invent fat-shaming, but exploits it.", "Her proposal was so juicy.", "It has a bigger, more important message about weight and health.'", "According to the newspaper, Hibbard's book claims that 'The Biggest Loser' refused to purchase new underwear for contestants, whose underwear drooped as the pounds came off.", "The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book.", "A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment.", "Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct.", "I hope more than a \"tell all\" that when all is said and done it stands as a statement on the media, society and how shame is not a motivator but a paralytic from someone who has regretfully been there and done that.'", "Remarks:", "Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster'", "Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment.", "She recently told the\u00a0New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I\u2019m embarrassed to have participated in.'", "She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, \"You\u2019re going die before your children grow up.\"", "\"You\u2019re going to die, just like your mother.\"", "\"We\u2019ve picked out your fat-person coffin\" - that was in a text message.", "One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.'", "Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out.", "My period stopped.", "I was only sleeping three hours a night.'", "At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised.", "The consistent \"Biggest Loser\" health transformations of over 300 contestants through 16 seasons of the program speak for themselves.'"], "sum_sents": ["kai hibbard worked on her book 'too fat' with deborah baer.", "hibbard finished the runner-up during the show's third season.", "hibbard finished as the runner-up in the show's third season.", "hibbard has penned an expose on'the biggest loser.", "a woman who appeared on nbc's weight-loss competition 'the biggest loser'"], "rel_index": [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8], "cot": "1.
