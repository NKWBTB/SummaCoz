The article provides details about the location of the incident, the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and other incidents in Sheffield but does not mention the victim's age.\n3. The inconsistency arises from the error in the summary, which inaccurately states the age of the victim as 23 years old and specifies that the shooting occurred outside a house, while the article provides a more general description of the location without mentioning the victim's age.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301": "Reasoning:\n- The article mentions a shooting that resulted in the death of a man.\n- The shooting occurred outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace in Upperthorpe, Sheffield.\n- The victim was found with a gunshot wound to his chest and was taken to Northern General hospital but died from his injuries.\n- The article does not provide the age of the victim, but it is consistent with the summary to say that he was 23 years old.\n\nConclusion: \nThe summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes"}
