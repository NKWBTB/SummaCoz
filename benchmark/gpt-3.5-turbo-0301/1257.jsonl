The article discusses the development of a blood test for Alzheimer's disease by researchers at the University of Nottingham. The test uses a combination of markers in the blood, including proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease and inflammation, to distinguish between healthy people and those with the disease. The test could lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
