{"document": "A Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York. The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'", "claim": "the idea is borrowed from the 2004 adam sandler film 50 first dates , in which drew barrymore 's character suffers a
