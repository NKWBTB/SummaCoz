{"document": "There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity\u00a0in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action. \u00a0Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans.
