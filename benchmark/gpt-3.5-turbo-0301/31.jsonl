But the corresponding sentence in article is but now conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23million chickens a year can be shown for the first time.

While the article does mention KFC's use of 23 million chickens a year, it provides much more detail about the conditions on the farms that supply KFC and the controversy surrounding those conditions. The summary is too brief and does not capture the main points of the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
