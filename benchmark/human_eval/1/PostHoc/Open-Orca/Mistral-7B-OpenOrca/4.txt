Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 1. Read the article carefully to understand the context and main points.
2. Identify the key information in the article: Marks & Spencer has a list of banned words, including 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ', which cannot be used in gift messages on bouquets of flowers.
3. Identify the inconsistency in the summary: The summary states that the word 'k' can also be included in messages, which is not mentioned in the article.
4. Compare the summary with the article to find the discrepancy: The summary does not accurately represent the information provided in the article.
5. Conclude that the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the banned words.
