Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions jim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special.
2. The original sentence in article is After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special.
3. The summary simply concatenate some words from the original sentence and discard the rest of words which express different meaning with article, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 1. Read the article and understand the main points.
2. Identify the key information in the article: Jim Hamilton's optimism about the team's potential, Scotland's recent struggles, and the belief that the team is on the verge of something special.
3. Compare the key information with the summary provided.
4. Notice that the summary only mentions Jim Hamilton being detached from reality, which is not the main point of the article.
5. Determine that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not capture the main points and focus on the team's potential and progress.
