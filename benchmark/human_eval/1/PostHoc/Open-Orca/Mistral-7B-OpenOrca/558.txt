Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 1. Read the article and the summary provided.
2. Identify the main points in the article:
   - Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval.
   - The motion will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales.
   - The law is called 'Turing's Law' and will allow posthumous pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences.
   - Living men convicted of such offences can also apply for a pardon.
   - The motion in the assembly is expected to contain the same provisions and allow for pardons both posthumously and for living gay and bisexual men.
   - The minister said that arrangements would be brought in "as soon as possible to ensure that there is equal treatment for gay and bisexual men here as for their counterparts in England and Wales."
   - The motion will now go forward for consideration by the assembly.

3. Compare the main points in the article with the summary:
   - The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland assembly.

4. Identify the inconsistency:
   - The summary claims that the proposal has been approved by the assembly, while the article states that a motion will go before the assembly for approval.

5. Conclusion:
   - The summary is not consistent with the article because it claims the proposal has been approved, while the article states that the motion is still awaiting approval by the assembly.
