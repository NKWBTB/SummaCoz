Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions jim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special.
2. The original sentence in article is After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special.
3. The summary simply concatenate some words from the original sentence and discard the rest of words which express different meaning with article, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Jim Hamilton believes Scotland is heading in the right direction under coach Vern Cotter, despite their poor performance in the Six Nations.
2. The article quotes Hamilton as saying, "I understand the results are the most important thing, but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future."
3. Hamilton cites young talent such as 21-year-old lock Jonny Gray as reasons for optimism going forward.
4. The article states that Scotland have shown glimpses of what they can do and have played some great stuff, but have been let down by silly mistakes that have cost them victory.
5. Hamilton is quoted as saying that winning is a habit they have simply got out of, and that they need to change their habit of losing.

Based on these points, it is clear that Jim Hamilton is not detached from the reality of Scotland's poor performance in the Six Nations. Instead, he is optimistic about the team's future and believes that they have the talent and potential to do something special. The summary statement "Jim Hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special" is therefore not consistent with the article.
