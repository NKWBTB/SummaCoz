Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote onÂ Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the Russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about the Russian saying this. In fact, the article states that the quote on Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page is a motto from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, but it does not quote the Russian as saying it is better to die from vodka than from boredom.
3. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it attributes a quote to the Russian that is not present in the article.

So, the reason why the summary is not consistent with the article is that it misattributed a quote to the Russian. The quote is actually from Vladimir Mayakovsky's Facebook page, not from the Russian himself.
