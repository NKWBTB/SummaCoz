Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the row brought simmering tensions between Miliband's ear. However, the article does not mention anything about Miliband's ear.
2. The article does mention that the dispute was between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, two powerful women in Ed Miliband's inner circle.
3. The summary implies that the row was between Miliband and one of the women, but the article does not support this.
4. The article states that the dispute was over an invitation to the Brit Awards and a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs.
5. The summary does not mention the Brit Awards or the vote called by Miliband.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies a different subject (Miliband's ear) and leaves out important details (the Brit Awards and the vote) that are mentioned in the article.
