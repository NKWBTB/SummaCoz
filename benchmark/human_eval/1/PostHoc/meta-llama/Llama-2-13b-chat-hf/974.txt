Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Parlour says Wilshere's fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential, but the article does not mention this.

In the article, Parlour is quoted as saying that Wilshere is the future of the club and that he has a big role to play, but there is no mention of fitness being an issue.

2. The summary states that Wilshere is a very good player and technically gifted, but the article does not provide any information about Wilshere's technical abilities or playing style.

The article focuses on Wilshere's return to the team after five months out with injury, and his potential to be a key player for Arsenal in the future.

3. The summary states that Wilshere has a great attitude and work ethic, but the article does not provide any information about his attitude or work ethic.

The article focuses on Wilshere's injury record and the fact that he has been out of the team for five months, but it does not mention his attitude or work ethic.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information that is not present in the article, and omits information that is present in the article.
