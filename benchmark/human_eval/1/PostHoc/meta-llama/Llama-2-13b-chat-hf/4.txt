Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary states that "k'' can also be included in messages," which is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The article states that the words "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are banned from gift messages on bouquets of flowers, but the summary implies that "k''" (which is likely a typo for "kris") is not banned.
2. The article does not mention any word called "k''" being banned or allowed.
3. The article only mentions banned words such as "f***," "gay," "jihad," "Buddha," and "Allah," but does not include "k''" in the list.
4. The summary's statement that "k'' can also be included in messages" is not supported by the article, as there is no mention of "k''" in the article at all.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and the statement about "k''" should be removed or corrected to accurately reflect the information in the article.
