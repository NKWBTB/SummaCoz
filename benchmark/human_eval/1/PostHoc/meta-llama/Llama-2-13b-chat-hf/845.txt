Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard, but the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates after firing at the guard.
2. The summary states that the guard died after investigating a couple fighting in a car, but the article does not mention this.
3. The summary states that the shooter took police on a wild chase back into D.C., but the article states that the shooter was shot and killed by police after a showdown in Northeast D.C.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains details that are not present in the article and omits other important details that are present in the article.
