Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions five ambitious clubs are locked in a bid for two champions league places.
2. But in the article it never mentions the word 'bid', the truth in article is five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places.
3. As the summary has the word should not be contained, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's why the provided summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary only mentions "five ambitious clubs" vying for two Champions League places, while the article mentions six clubs (Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Southampton, Tottenham, and Everton) competing for those places.
2. The summary does not provide any specific information about the clubs' current standings or their chances of securing a top-four finish, while the article provides detailed information about each club's current points total, recent form, and upcoming fixtures.
3. The summary does not mention the article's central theme of the "Rat Race" for the top four finish, which is a key concept in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not a consistent representation of the article's content and does not provide an accurate overview of the article's main points.
