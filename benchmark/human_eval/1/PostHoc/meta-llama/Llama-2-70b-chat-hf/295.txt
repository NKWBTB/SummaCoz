Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the summary is inconsistent:

1. The article states that the new species of catfish was named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, but the summary incorrectly states that the catfish was discovered by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History.
2. The article mentions that the catfish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil, but the summary does not mention the location where the catfish was discovered.
3. The article explains that the new species of catfish Peckoltia greedoi has large eyes and a sucker mouth, but the summary does not mention the sucker mouth.
4. The article mentions that the name Peckoltia greedoi was chosen because it resembles the bounty hunter Greedo from Star Wars, but the summary does not mention the name of the character that the catfish was named after.
5. The summary mentions Han Solo, an extinct species found in southern China, but the article does not mention anything about Han Solo or an extinct species found in southern China.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information and leaves out important details.
