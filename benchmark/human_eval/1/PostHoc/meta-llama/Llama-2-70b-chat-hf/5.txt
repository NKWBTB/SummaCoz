Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the information provided in the article. Here's why:

1. The article describes a dispute between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, two powerful women in Ed Miliband's inner circle, over Powell's plans to attend the Brit Awards.
2. The summary, however, suggests that the row brought simmering tensions between Miliband's ear, which is not mentioned in the article at all.
3. The article does mention that the dispute between Powell and Winterton brought tensions between the two women to a head, but it does not mention anything about Miliband's ear.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a new and unrelated idea (Miliband's ear) that is not supported by the information in the article.
5. To make the summary consistent with the article, it should focus on the actual information provided, such as the dispute between Powell and Winterton and their differing approaches to politics.
