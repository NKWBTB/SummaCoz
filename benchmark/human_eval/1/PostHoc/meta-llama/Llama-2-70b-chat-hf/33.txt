Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Here's why:

1. The article does not mention the exact lifespan of the chickens. The summary states that the chickens live for 35 days before they are gassed, but the article only mentions that the chickens are gassed when they are large enough.
2. The article does not mention the method of gassing. The summary states that the chickens are gassed, but the article only mentions that they are killed and chopped into nine pieces.
3. The summary implies that all KFC chickens are raised in huge sheds, but the article only mentions that tens of thousands of chickens are kept in huge sheds. It does not specify whether all KFC chickens are raised in these conditions.
4. The summary implies that the chickens are kept in oppressive conditions, but the article quotes the farmer in charge saying that the chickens have a "very good life." The article also mentions that animal rights campaigners claim the lives of the KFC chickens are "oppressive," but it does not take a clear stance on the issue.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article, and it implies certain things that are not explicitly stated in the article.
