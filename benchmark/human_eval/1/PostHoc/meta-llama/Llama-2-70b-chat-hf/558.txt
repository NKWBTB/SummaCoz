Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The article states that the motion to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences has been proposed and is expected to go before the assembly for approval, but it does not mention the proposal being approved by the assembly.
2. The summary implies that the proposal has already been approved by the assembly, which is not supported by the article.
3. The article quotes the Justice Minister, Claire Sugden, saying that she has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offences, but it does not mention the assembly approving the proposal.
4. The article states that the motion will now go forward for consideration by the assembly, indicating that the proposal is still in the process of being considered and has not yet been approved.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the proposal has already been approved by the assembly, when in fact, it is still in the process of being considered.
