Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions that "** k**" can be included in messages, but the article does not mention this. In fact, the article states that "terrorist" and "d**k" are the only two words that can be included in messages, and does not mention "** k**" at all. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The article mentions that "terrorist" and "d**k" can be included in messages.
2. The summary mentions that "** k**" can also be included in messages.
3. The article does not mention "** k**" as a word that can be included in messages.
4. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article.
