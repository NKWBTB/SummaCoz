Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Centrelink payments made up Radio Rentals' entire income last year, which is not supported by the information in the article. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:

1. The article states that "nearly half of the Radio Rentals customers have been found to be on welfare payments" (emphasis added). This means that not all of Radio Rentals' customers are on welfare payments, and therefore, not all of their income comes from Centrelink payments.
2. The article later mentions that "Of the $197 million of revenue they made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay" (emphasis added). This means that only a portion of Radio Rentals' revenue comes from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
3. The summary, on the other hand, states that "the ABC have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up Radio Rentals' income last year" (emphasis added). This implies that all of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, which is not supported by the information in the article.
4. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it overstates the proportion of Radio Rentals' income that comes from Centrelink payments. The article only states that Centrelink payments make up a significant portion of their revenue, not their entire income.
