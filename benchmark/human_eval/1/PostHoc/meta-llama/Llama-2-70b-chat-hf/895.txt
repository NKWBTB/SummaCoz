Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming , who played for nba 's houston rockets from 2002 to 2011. But in the article it mentions mai zizhuo and yao ming are not the same person. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the summary mentions that Mai Zizhuo has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, and that he is Shanghai-born, but the article does not provide any information about Mai's birthplace or how long he has been playing basketball.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The article mentions that Mai Zizhuo is a five-year-old child who has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, according to the People's Daily Online.
2. The summary states that Mai Zizhuo has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, which is consistent with the information provided in the article.
3. However, the summary also states that Mai Zizhuo is Shanghai-born, which is not mentioned in the article.
4. The article only mentions that Mai Zizhuo is from China, but it does not provide any specific information about his birthplace.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes information about Mai's birthplace that is not supported by the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains extraneous information that is not supported by the article. To fix this issue, the summary should only include information that is directly supported by the article, such as Mai's age, basketball skills, and popularity among Chinese netizens.
