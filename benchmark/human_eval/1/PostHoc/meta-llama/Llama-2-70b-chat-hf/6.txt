1. The name of the victim in the summary is "katarzyne pietrzycka" while in the article, her name is "Katarzyna Pietrzycka".
2. The summary states that the attacker was a Thai court, while the article states that the attacker was a Thai transvestite named Plagad Somian.
3. The summary does not mention the location of the attack, while the article states that the attack took place in the red light district of Pattaya, Thailand.
4. The summary does not mention the motive for the attack, while the article states that the attacker was jealous over the victim's husband and had been talking to him before the attack.
