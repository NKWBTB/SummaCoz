Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the inconsistencies:

1. The summary states that the shooter took three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. However, the article does not mention anything about a chase involving three dozen police officers. Instead, it says that the shooter led police on a chase that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street.
2. The summary states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. However, the article does not mention anything about the shooter trying to ram the gates. It only mentions that the shooter rammed the front gates before firing at the guard.
3. The summary states that the guard died after being taken to a Washington area hospital. However, the article states that the guard died before 10pm, which suggests that he died at the scene or en route to the hospital, rather than after being taken to the hospital.
4. The summary does not mention anything about the shooter being shot several times or about two police officers being wounded in the showdown, which are important details mentioned in the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and omits important information.
