Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. Here are the reasons why:

1. The summary states that Natalia Moon is 23 years old, but the article mentions that she is 23 years old in 2014, which means she is probably older now.
2. The summary says that Natalia Moon moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, but the article states that she moved to the Philippines in 2012 to pursue her dreams and become a star, and that she was not able to find work as an actress in Australia.
3. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon learned the Filipino language Tagalog to score a role on the sitcom Ismol Family, which is a significant part of her story.
4. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon is also a model who has been featured on magazine covers in the Philippines.
5. The summary states that Natalia Moon landed a major role in 2014 playing a catty maid named Natalia in the new sitcom Ismol Family, but the article mentions that she landed the role in 2014 and that the show is the Philippines' answer to US hit series Modern Family.
6. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon unsuccessfully auditioned for Asia's Got Talent, which is a significant part of her story.
7. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon is nominated for Outstanding Breakthrough Performance By An Actress at the Golden Screen TV Awards, which is a significant achievement.
8. The summary does not mention that the show Ismol Family has also received a nomination for best comedy.
9. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon is embarking on a singing career, writing and performing songs in both English and Tagalog.
10. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon performs a very diverse range of musical styles including country, pop, R&B and rap.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions, and it does not fully capture the details and achievements of Natalia Moon's story.
