Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The article states that Amir Khan had hoped to fight Floyd Mayweather, but the summary says he had hoped to take him on in a $300million mega-fight. This is an error in wording, as the article clearly states that Khan had hoped to fight Mayweather, not take him on in a mega-fight.
2. The article mentions that Adrien Broner won a unanimous points decision over John Molina on Saturday, but the summary does not include this information.
3. The article quotes Floyd Mayweather as saying that he doesn't have an easy fight on May 3, 2014, and that he would fight Khan if he wins his next fight. The summary does not include this quote from Mayweather.
4. The article mentions that Khan instead went on to beat Luis Collazo and then Devon Alexander, but the summary does not include this information.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains errors in wording and omits important information.
