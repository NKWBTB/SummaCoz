2. Age: The article states that Katarzyna Pietrzycka is 45 years old, while the summary gives her age as 42.
3. Nationality: The article mentions that the attacker is a Thai transvestite, while the summary does not provide any information about the attacker's nationality.
4. Location: The article specifically mentions the location of the attack as Pattaya, Thailand, while the summary does not provide any information about the location.
5. Reason for the attack: The article states that the attack was due to the attacker's jealousy over the victim's husband, while the summary does not provide any explanation for the attack.
6. Injuries: The article mentions that the victim was bleeding heavily from her head after the attack, while the summary does not provide any information about the injuries sustained by the victim.
7. Quotations: The article includes quotations from witnesses and the police, while the summary does not provide any quotations or contextual information to support the summary.

Overall, the summary does not provide consistent information with the article, which makes it unreliable and potentially misleading.
