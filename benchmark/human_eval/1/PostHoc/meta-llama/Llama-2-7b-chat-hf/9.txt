Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Inconsistent timeline: The summary states that the home was built for inspection "just a day after his sudden passing," but the article does not mention anything about Malcolm Fraser's passing. In fact, the article states that he died "peacefully" on Friday morning, which is after the home was opened for inspection.
2. Incorrect information: The summary states that the home was built for Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie, but the article does not provide any information about the home's builders or the year it was built.
3. Lack of context: The summary does not provide any context about the significance of the home or its location, which is mentioned in the article as a "sensational slice of Canberra's political history."
4. Inconsistent language: The summary uses different language than the article, such as "the home was built for inspection" instead of "the property was listed for sale."

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and contains incorrect information.
