Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Inconsistent language: The summary uses the term "departmental elections" when the article refers to "regional elections" throughout.
2. Missing information: The summary does not include information about the number of departments won by each party, as mentioned in the article. According to the exit polls, the UMP and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as President Hollande's Socialists.
3. Incorrect statement: The summary states that Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections, when in fact the article states that the UMP party under Nicolas Sarkozy's leadership won up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists.
4. Omitted context: The summary does not provide context for the election results, such as the historical significance of the UMP's win, the impact on the political landscape, or the implications for the 2017 presidential race.
5. Incorrect conclusion: The summary concludes that Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections, when in fact the article states that the UMP party under Nicolas Sarkozy's leadership won up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and requires revision to accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
