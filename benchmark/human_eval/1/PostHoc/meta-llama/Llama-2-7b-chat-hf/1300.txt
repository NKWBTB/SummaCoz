Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the London Film Festival, its director and a record of people's attendance.
2. However, there is no mention of the London Film Festival in the article.
3. The article is about a film called "Turning Points" and its director, Chris Tally Evans, who is from Rhayader, Powys. The article discusses the film's premiere at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and its inclusion in the London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Attendance at the London Film Festival: The summary states that a record 25,000 people attended the London Film Festival in September, while the article does not mention anything about the London Film Festival.
2. Director's quote: The summary attributes a quote to the film's director, Chris Tally Evans, that is not present in the article. The article does not include any quote from Tally Evans about using a dialogue coach to boost his confidence.
3. Participants' names: The summary lists the names of some of the participants in the film, including Sir Roger, Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, and artist Ellen Jackman, while the article does not provide their names.
4. Stories' range: The summary states that there are 100 stories in total, while the article mentions that there are "a huge range of stories" but does not provide a specific number.
5. Vibrant images: The summary describes the images in the film as "vibrant" and "sometimes satirical," while the article does not mention anything about the visual style of the film.
6. Contributions from celebrities: The summary mentions contributions from celebrities such as Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and Jackie Stewart, while the article does not include any information about their involvement in the film.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and appears to be a separate piece of content altogether.
