Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The article does not mention the catfish being named after Han Solo. In fact, the article states that the new species of catfish, Peckoltia greedoi, was named after the Star Wars character Greedo.
2. The article does not mention the discovery of the catfish in southern China. In fact, the article states that the catfish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil.
3. The article does not mention any other species of insect or animal being named after characters from the Star Wars films. While the article does mention other species being named after Star Wars characters, such as Yoda purpurata and Aptostichus sarlaac, these are not mentioned in the summary.
4. The summary mentions the catfish being named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, but the article does not provide any information about the museum or the biologists involved in the discovery and naming of the catfish.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and omissions compared to the article.
