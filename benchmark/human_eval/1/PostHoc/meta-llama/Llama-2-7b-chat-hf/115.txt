Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions jim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special.
2. The original sentence in article is After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special.
3. The summary simply concatenate some words from the original sentence and discard the rest of words which express different meaning with article, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Lack of support for the claim: The summary states that Jim Hamilton is "a little detached from the reality of something special," but the article provides no evidence or quotes to support this claim. In fact, the article highlights Hamilton's optimism and belief in the team's potential, which is in contrast to the summary's assertion.
2. Misinterpretation of the article's tone: The summary implies that Hamilton's optimism is unfounded and unrealistic, but the article presents Hamilton's views in a neutral and balanced manner. The article acknowledges that the team is facing challenges but also highlights the potential of the young players and the progress being made under coach Vern Cotter.
3. Misrepresentation of the article's content: The summary focuses on Hamilton's optimism, but the article provides a more comprehensive picture of the team's situation, including the challenges they face and the progress they have made. The summary ignores the article's discussion of the team's performance, the young players' potential, and the coach's game plan.
4. Inconsistency with the article's overall tone: The summary's negative tone is at odds with the article's more balanced and optimistic tone. The article presents a nuanced view of the team's situation, acknowledging both the challenges they face and the potential they have shown. The summary, on the other hand, presents a one-sided view that is not supported by the article's content.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the tone and content of the article, and it fails to provide evidence or quotes to support its claims.
