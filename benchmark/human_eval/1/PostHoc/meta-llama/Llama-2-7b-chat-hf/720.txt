Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Age: The summary states that Natalia Moon is 23 years old, while the article does not mention her age.
2. Background: The summary mentions that Natalia Moon moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, while the article does not provide any information about her background or previous experience.
3. Role: The summary states that Natalia Moon plays a catty maid named Natalia in the sitcom "Ismol Family," while the article mentions that she plays a character named Natalia in the show, but does not specify her role.
4. Language: The summary states that Natalia Moon speaks both English and Tagalog, while the article does not mention anything about her language skills.
5. Talents: The summary mentions that Natalia Moon is a singer, dancer, and model, while the article only mentions her acting career.
6. Awards: The summary states that Natalia Moon has been nominated for an award at the Golden Screen TV Awards, while the article does not mention any awards or nominations.
7. Audition: The summary mentions that Natalia Moon unsuccessfully auditioned for Asia's Got Talent, while the article does not provide any information about her audition or any other singing performances.

Overall, the summary contains several inaccuracies and exaggerations compared to the information provided in the article.
