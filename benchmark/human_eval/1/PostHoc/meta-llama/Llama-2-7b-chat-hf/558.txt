Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Lack of specific details: The summary does not provide specific details about the proposal, such as which sexual offences are to be pardoned, how many men are expected to be affected, and when the pardons will be granted. The article, on the other hand, provides specific information about the types of offences that will be pardoned and the timeline for the pardons.
2. Inaccurate language: The summary uses the term "gay and bisexual men" to describe those who will be pardoned, while the article uses the term "men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences." This suggests that the summary may be including a broader group of individuals than the article intends to pardon.
3. Omitted context: The summary does not provide any context for the proposal, such as why it is being proposed or what prompted the motion. The article provides background information on the history of the offences and the reasons for the pardons, which is important for understanding the significance of the proposal.
4. Inconsistent tone: The summary has a more sensational tone than the article, using phrases such as "an opportunity for the criminal justice system to try and right the wrongs of the past" and "much earlier resolve than that presented by way of an assembly bill." The article, on the other hand, presents the proposal in a more straightforward and factual manner.

Overall, the summary does not accurately convey the information and context provided in the article, and may be misleading or incomplete for readers who rely on it as their sole source of information.
