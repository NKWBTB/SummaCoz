Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming , who played for nba 's houston rockets from 2002 to 2011. But in the article it mentions mai zizhuo and yao ming are not the same person. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the statement that "the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming, who played for NBA's Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011."

Step by step reasoning:

1. The first part of the summary is consistent with the article: "five-year-old mai zizhuo has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, reported the people's daily online." This information is directly supported by the article, which states the same facts about Mai Zizhuo's age and when he started playing basketball.

2. The inconsistency arises in the second part of the summary: "the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming, who played for NBA's Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011." This sentence is constructed in a way that suggests Mai Zizhuo is also Yao Ming, which is not true. The article mentions Yao Ming as a separate individual, describing him as "the country's biggest basketball star so far," and does not imply that Mai Zizhuo is Yao Ming or has any direct connection to him.

3. The correct interpretation of the article is that Mai Zizhuo is a separate individual, a young basketball prodigy gaining attention in China, while Yao Ming is a former professional basketball player who had a successful career in the NBA with the Houston Rockets.

4. Therefore, the summary incorrectly combines the identity of the child prodigy Mai Zizhuo with that of the retired basketball player Yao Ming, which is not supported by the article and creates a factual inconsistency.
