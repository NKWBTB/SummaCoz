Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Natalia Moon "moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012." This is inconsistent with the article, which indicates that she moved to the Philippines after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not in the Philippines.

2. The summary repeats the year "2012" twice in the same sentence, which is redundant and does not align with the article's more fluid description of events.

3. The article mentions that Natalia Moon became fluent in Tagalog and landed a major role in the sitcom 'Ismol Family' in 2014, which is not mentioned in the summary. This is a significant part of her success story in the Philippines and should be included for an accurate summary.

4. The article also notes that she is nominated for an award and is pursuing a singing career, which are important details about her achievements that are not captured in the summary.

5. The summary does not mention her original name, Natalie Stewart, which is included in the article and is relevant to her identity and background.

6. The summary does not reflect the full scope of her popularity in the Philippines, such as her being known as 'the blonde Filipino' and having a strong fan base, which are key points in the article.

In conclusion, the summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly states the country where she struggled to find work, omits significant details about her career development in the Philippines, and does not accurately reflect the timeline or the breadth of her achievements.
