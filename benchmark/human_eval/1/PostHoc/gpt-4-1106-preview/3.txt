Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary states that "Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections." To assess the consistency of this summary with the article, we need to examine the details provided about the election results and the parties involved.

1. The article mentions that "Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party" was successful in the regional elections, controlling up to 70 departments compared to 37 for the Socialists. This indicates that Sarkozy's party did indeed perform well in the elections.

2. The article also refers to an "electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI)." This suggests that Sarkozy's UMP party was in an alliance with another party, the UDI, during the elections.

3. Sarkozy is quoted in the article saying, "Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments." This statement supports the idea that the alliance, which includes his party, achieved a significant victory.

4. The article does not provide any contradictory information that would suggest the summary is inconsistent with the article's content regarding the election results and the parties involved.

Based on the information provided in the article, the summary is consistent with the article. Sarkozy's UMP party, in alliance with the UDI, did win the departmental elections, which is what the summary states.
