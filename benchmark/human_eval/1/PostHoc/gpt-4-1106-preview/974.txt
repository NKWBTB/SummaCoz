Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the fact that it attributes quotes to Ray Parlour that are not present in the article. The summary includes statements such as "He's a very good player, he's a very technically gifted player and he's got a great attitude. 'He's got a great attitude, a great work ethic, he's a very good player. I think he's got a great future," which are not found in the article text.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning to identify the inconsistency:

1. The article discusses Ray Parlour's opinion on Jack Wilshere's fitness and potential. Parlour is quoted saying, "I think he’s the future of the club," and "I think if he stays fit, he’s a quality player, there’s no doubt about that."

2. The article mentions Parlour's comments on Wilshere's ability to go past players and link up with others, as well as the importance of staying fit, given his injury history.

3. The summary, however, includes additional praise for Wilshere's technical skills, attitude, work ethic, and future prospects, which are not directly quoted or paraphrased from Parlour's comments in the article.

4. Since the summary introduces statements that are not supported by the article, it is not consistent with the article's content.

In conclusion, the inconsistency arises because the summary attributes additional positive remarks to Ray Parlour that are not found in the article, thus misrepresenting the extent of Parlour's quoted commentary.
