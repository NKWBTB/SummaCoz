Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the London Film Festival, its director and a record of people's attendance.
2. However, there is no mention of the London Film Festival in the article.
3. The article is about a film called "Turning Points" and its director, Chris Tally Evans, who is from Rhayader, Powys. The article discusses the film's premiere at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and its inclusion in the London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary provided states that "a record 25,000 people attended the London Film Festival in September," and attributes this statement to the festival's director. However, the article does not mention the London Film Festival at all, nor does it provide any attendance figures or quotes from a festival director about attendance numbers.

The article actually discusses a different event, the London 2012 Festival, which is a nationwide arts event, and specifically focuses on the film "Turning Points" by Chris Tally Evans. The article details the content of the film, its premiere at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff, and its subsequent showings, including one at the Southbank Centre in London. It also mentions various individuals who contributed to the film.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary refers to an entirely different event (the London Film Festival) and provides attendance figures that are not supported by the article, which is about the London 2012 Festival and the film "Turning Points."
