Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary contains several inconsistencies with the article:

1. The name "John Fett" is not mentioned in the article. The article refers to a person who goes by the name "Mick Fett," not John Fett. This is a clear discrepancy in the name of the individual being discussed.

2. The summary states that the individual is an actor, which is not supported by the article. The article describes Mick Fett as a Star Wars enthusiast and collector, not as an actor. There is no mention of him having any acting roles in the Star Wars franchise or elsewhere.

3. The summary refers to "the latest collection of Star Wars: The Force Awakens." However, the article does not mention "The Force Awakens" at all. Instead, it discusses Mick Fett's personal collection of Star Wars memorabilia and his experiences related to the Star Wars franchise, including attending a convention and customizing a Darth Vader costume.

4. The phrase "overwhelmed by the latest collection" suggests that Mick Fett is reacting to a new collection, possibly released to the public. In contrast, the article quotes Mick Fett saying his girlfriend was "a bit overwhelmed at first" by his personal collection of Star Wars items, which is a different context.

5. The article focuses on Mick Fett's extensive collection of Star Wars memorabilia, his custom Darth Vader costume, and his thoughts on the movie "Rogue One." The summary does not accurately reflect any of these key points from the article.

In conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misidentifies the subject, incorrectly labels him as an actor, references the wrong Star Wars film, and misrepresents the context in which the word "overwhelmed" was used.
