Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that "Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a court being involved in the attack.
2. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article describes an incident where Katarzyna Pietrzycka was attacked by a Thai transvestite named Plagad Somian, not by a Thai court. The summary incorrectly identifies the attacker as a "Thai court," which is an institution responsible for administering justice, not an individual.

2. The article provides a detailed account of the attack, including the location (Pattaya, Thailand), the nature of the assault (with a stiletto shoe), and the aftermath (Pietrzycka being taken to the hospital). It also includes quotes from witnesses and a police statement. None of these details mention a court being involved in the attack itself.

3. The article does mention that Somian has been charged and is being kept in detention pending trial, which implies that a court will be involved in the judicial process following the attack. However, this is separate from the attack itself and does not make the court the assailant.

4. The summary fails to accurately reflect the information provided in the article, as it incorrectly attributes the attack to a Thai court rather than the individual, Plagad Somian, who is actually accused of committing the assault.
