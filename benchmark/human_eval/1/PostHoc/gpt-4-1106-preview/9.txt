Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the interpretation of the phrase "built for inspection." The summary suggests that the home was constructed with the purpose of being inspected just a day after Malcolm Fraser's passing, which is not accurate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that the home, known as JM Fraser House, was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie, not specifically "built for inspection."

2. The article mentions that the home was opened for inspection a day after Malcolm Fraser's sudden passing, which implies that the inspection event was scheduled following his death, not that the house was constructed at that time.

3. The article provides historical context, stating that the property was built three years after the Frasers married and that Malcolm Fraser was a backbencher when he moved into the house. This information confirms that the house has existed for many years and was not recently constructed.

4. The article also notes that the property was last sold 20 years ago to Tony and Sue Marinos, which further supports the fact that the house was not built recently but has been standing for a significant period.

5. The summary's claim that the home was "built for inspection" is inconsistent with the article's information, which clearly indicates that the house was an existing residence of historical significance and was merely opened for inspection following the former prime minister's death.
