Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions jim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special.
2. The original sentence in article is After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special.
3. The summary simply concatenate some words from the original sentence and discard the rest of words which express different meaning with article, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary states that "Jim Hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special." This statement is inconsistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The article describes Jim Hamilton as maintaining a positive outlook on the Scottish team's future despite their current struggles. He is quoted as saying, "I understand the results are the most important thing, but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future."

2. Hamilton acknowledges the team's lack of wins ("On paper, it doesn't look like we've done too well as we haven't won a game"), but he also expresses a strong belief in the team's potential and direction under coach Vern Cotter.

3. The article provides direct quotes from Hamilton that show his optimism and faith in the team's abilities and future success. He cites the young talent in the team and their ability to play "great stuff" as reasons for his belief that the team is "definitely on the up."

4. The summary's claim that Hamilton is "detached from reality" suggests a disconnect or lack of awareness of the team's situation. However, the article portrays Hamilton as being very much aware of the team's current struggles but choosing to focus on the positive aspects and potential for improvement.

5. The overall tone of Hamilton's comments in the article is one of hope and confidence, not detachment. He even discusses the team's ability to change their losing habit and the possibility of winning against Ireland.

In conclusion, the summary misrepresents Jim Hamilton's perspective as described in the article. Hamilton is not depicted as being detached from reality; rather, he is portrayed as an experienced player who, despite acknowledging the team's current challenges, has a strong belief in their potential and future success.
