Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary provided states, "it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran," which is inconsistent with the information presented in the article. Here's why:

1. The article discusses a specific deal that has been struck between Iran and six world powers, which includes measures to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. The deal is clearly intended to be implemented and used as a means to limit Iran's nuclear program.

2. The article mentions that the framework of the deal was announced and involves lifting Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran reducing the number of active centrifuges and limiting its highly enriched uranium, among other things. This indicates that there is a clear intention for the deal to be put into effect.

3. The article also includes comments from various political figures, including President Barack Obama, who endorsed the deal, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who criticized it. The discussion of the deal's merits and criticisms by such high-profile individuals further supports the fact that the deal is intended to be operational.

4. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz is quoted in the article as defending the deal, explaining that it would extend the "breakout" time period and allow for the "almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal." This defense of the deal's mechanisms implies that it is expected to be functional and utilized.

5. The article does not express any ambiguity about whether the deal will be used. Instead, it focuses on the debate over the quality and effectiveness of the deal, with some politicians suggesting that a better deal could be negotiated in the future.

In summary, the article clearly discusses a deal that is intended to be implemented and used to control Iran's nuclear capabilities, and there is no indication that there is uncertainty about the deal's usage in Iran. The summary's statement about the clarity of the deal's use is therefore inconsistent with the article's content.
