Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the sequence of events and the outcome of the guard's encounter with the shooter. Let's analyze the summary and the article step by step:

1. The summary states that the guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. This is consistent with the article, which mentions that the guard was critically wounded after being shot.

2. The summary then mentions that the shooter took some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when ramming the front gates. This is inconsistent with the article, which states that the chase ended when officers shot the suspect on a busy Northeast Washington street, not by ramming the front gates. The ramming of the gates occurred earlier, at the Census Bureau, before the chase ensued.

3. The summary also states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. This is consistent with the article, which describes the shooter trying to ram the gates before shooting the guard.

4. The summary concludes by saying that the guard went to investigate and it cost him his life. This is inconsistent with the article, which states that the guard died before 10 pm after being taken to a Washington area hospital. The summary incorrectly implies that the guard died at the scene while investigating, whereas the article clarifies that he died later in the hospital.

In summary, the inconsistency lies in the incorrect sequence of events regarding the chase and the implication that the guard died at the scene, whereas the article states he died later in the hospital.
