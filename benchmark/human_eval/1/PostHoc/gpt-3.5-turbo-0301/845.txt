Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and missing information. 

1. The summary states that the shooter took police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when ramming the front gates, but the article states that the shooter was chased by police officers and was eventually shot on a busy Northeast Washington street. 

2. The summary implies that the guard was shot after the shooter rammed the front gates, but the article states that the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and going to investigate. 

3. The summary does not mention that the guard later died from his injuries, which is stated in the article. 

4. The summary does not mention that the shooter may be tied to another shooting that occurred in the Southeast quadrant of the city, which is mentioned in the article. 

Overall, the summary is incomplete and inaccurate, and does not provide a clear and accurate representation of the article.
