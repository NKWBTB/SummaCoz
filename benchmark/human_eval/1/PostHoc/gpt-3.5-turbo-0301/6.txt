Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that "Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a court being involved in the attack.
2. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article. The article states that Katarzyna Pietrzycka was attacked by a jealous transvestite named Plagad Somian with her stiletto shoe. The article provides details of the incident, including how Somian had been hassling Marek Pietrzycka, Katarzyna's husband, and how Katarzyna was knocked to the ground and left bleeding heavily from her head. The article also mentions that Somian has been arrested and charged with causing bodily harm. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and inaccurate as it fails to mention the attacker's identity, motive, and the circumstances surrounding the attack.
