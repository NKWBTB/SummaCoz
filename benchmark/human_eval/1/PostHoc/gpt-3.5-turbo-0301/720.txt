Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies and omissions. 

1. The summary states that Natalia Moon became a TV sensation in the Philippines, but it does not mention that she earned a legion of adoring fans in southeast Asia and an award nomination for her role in the country's answer to US hit series Modern Family. This information is important because it highlights the extent of her success in the Philippines.

2. The summary states that Natalia Moon moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012. This is a contradiction because it suggests that she was already in the Philippines before she moved there. The article actually states that she moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to hit the big time in Australia.

3. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon became fluent in the local language, Tagalog, in the hope of becoming a star. This is important because it shows her dedication to her craft and her willingness to adapt to a new culture.

4. The summary states that Natalia Moon is a model who has been featured on magazine cousins in the Philippines. This is a typo and should read "magazine covers." 

5. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon landed a major role in 2014 playing a catty maid, also named Natalia, in the new sitcom 'Ismol Family'. This is a significant achievement and a major reason for her success in the Philippines.

6. The summary states that Natalia Moon unsuccessfully auditioned for Asia's Got Talent in the hope of representing the Philippines. This is true, but it does not mention that she performed in front of judges Melanie C from The Spice Girls, Anggun, David Foster and Vanness Wu, singing Super Bass by Nikki Minaj and Rita Ora's I Will Never Let You Down. This information is important because it shows her versatility as a performer.

7. The summary does not mention that Natalia Moon is also embarking on a singing career, writing and performing songs in both English and Tagalog. This is a significant aspect of her career and highlights her multi-talented nature.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it omits important information and contains inaccuracies.
