Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it misses several important details. 

1. The article mentions that the proposal is for automatic pardons, not just pardons in general. 
2. The proposal is not just for gay and bisexual men, but specifically for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences. 
3. The proposal includes both posthumous pardons and pardons for living men who apply. 
4. The proposal is dubbed "Turing's Law" after Alan Turing, a World War Two code-breaker. 

Therefore, the summary is incomplete and not consistent with the article.
