Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only talks about Jack Wilshere's potential and fitness record, while the article also mentions Mesut Ozil's excitement about his new Apple Watch and the upcoming match between Arsenal and Chelsea. The summary does not mention anything about Ozil or the match, which are both discussed in the article. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and not consistent with the article.
