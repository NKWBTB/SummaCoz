4. As the summary use the wrong information that is not included in article, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one aspect of the article, which is that Amir Khan had hoped to fight Floyd Mayweather in a $300 million mega-fight. However, the article goes on to discuss how Khan is now interested in fighting Adrien Broner, who recently won a unanimous points decision over John Molina. The article also mentions how Broner has expressed interest in fighting Khan and even suggested he would be willing to come to England to do so. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
