Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one aspect of the election results, while the article provides more information. The article states that the ruling Socialists suffered a crushing defeat, losing 30 of the regional councils to Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party, which could end up with nearly twice as many seats as the Socialists. The article also mentions the far-right National Front's gains in the election and the significance of the results for the 2017 presidential race. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and not consistent with the article.
