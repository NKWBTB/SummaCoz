Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because there is no mention of an actor named John Fett in the article. The article talks about a man named Mick Fett who has a vast collection of Star Wars merchandise and costumes, and who has redecorated a Darth Vader costume with Australian-themed elements. Therefore, the summary is not supported by the information in the article.
