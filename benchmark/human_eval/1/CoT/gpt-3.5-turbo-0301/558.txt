Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article discusses a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland. - True
2. The proposal has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly. - False (the article states that a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not mention whether or not it has been approved yet)
3. The proposal is in line with plans for automatic pardons in England and Wales. - True
4. The proposal would allow for posthumous pardons as well as pardons for living men convicted of abolished sexual offences. - True
5. The proposal is referred to as "Turing's Law" after Alan Turing. - False (while the plans in England and Wales are referred to as "Turing's Law," the article does not mention this term in relation to the Northern Ireland proposal)
6. The Justice Minister, Claire Sugden, has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion. - True
7. The proposal is expected to bring equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland as in England and Wales. - True
8. The proposal will be presented as an assembly bill. - False (the article states that arrangements will be brought in "as soon as possible to ensure that there is equal treatment for gay and bisexual men here as for their counterparts in England and Wales," but it does not mention that it will be presented as an assembly bill)
9. The motion will now go forward for consideration by the assembly. - True

Overall, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, but it incorrectly states that the proposal has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly. The answer is no.
