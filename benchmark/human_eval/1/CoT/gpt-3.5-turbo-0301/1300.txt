Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the London Film Festival, its director and a record of people's attendance.
2. However, there is no mention of the London Film Festival in the article.
3. The article is about a film called "Turning Points" and its director, Chris Tally Evans, who is from Rhayader, Powys. The article discusses the film's premiere at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and its inclusion in the London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The article is about a film called Turning Points, produced and directed by Chris Tally Evans, which explores the moment when six people's lives change forever. The film has been made for London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event. 

Step 2: The article mentions the premiere of the film at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and its transfer to the Southbank Centre in London. It also talks about the stories collected for the film from people of all ages, abilities and walks of life, including Sir Roger, Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, artist Ellen Jackman, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, 11-year-old Daniel Chapman who has autism, and the filmmaker himself. 

Step 3: The article mentions the contribution of a dialogue coach in boosting Sir Roger's confidence and helping him forge his career. It also talks about the hereditary eye problem of Tally Evans, which left him partially sighted, and how he refused rehab and lived the life he wanted. 

Step 4: The article mentions the showing of the film at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, and the other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas. 

Step 5: The article does not mention anything about a record 25,000 people attending the London Film Festival in September. 

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
