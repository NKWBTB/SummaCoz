Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The article discusses how Marks & Spencer has banned the words 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' from being used in gift messages for bouquets of flowers. 

Step 2: The summary only mentions that "k'' can also be included in messages." This information is not supported by the article and is therefore inconsistent. 

The answer is no.
