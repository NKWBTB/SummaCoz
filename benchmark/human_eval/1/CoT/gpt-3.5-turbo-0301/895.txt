Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming , who played for nba 's houston rockets from 2002 to 2011. But in the article it mentions mai zizhuo and yao ming are not the same person. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article. While the summary mentions that Mai Zizhuo has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, it incorrectly states that he is called "shanghai-born yao ming," who is actually a different person mentioned in the article as China's biggest basketball star. Therefore, the summary is missing important information about Mai Zizhuo's impressive basketball skills and the viral video that has gained him legions of fans in China.
