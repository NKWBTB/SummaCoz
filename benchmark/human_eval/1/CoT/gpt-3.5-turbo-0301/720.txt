Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.
