Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the London Film Festival, its director and a record of people's attendance.
2. However, there is no mention of the London Film Festival in the article.
3. The article is about a film called "Turning Points" and its director, Chris Tally Evans, who is from Rhayader, Powys. The article discusses the film's premiere at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and its inclusion in the London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article discusses the London 2012 Festival and the film Turning Points, which is part of the festival.
2. The summary mentions the London Film Festival, but the article does not mention this event.
3. The summary mentions a record 25,000 people attending the London Film Festival, but the article does not provide any information about attendance numbers for the festival.
4. The article focuses on the stories shared in Turning Points and the impact it has on the audience, whereas the summary only mentions the attendance record for the London Film Festival.

Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary provides information that is not present in the article, and it does not accurately summarize the content of the article.
