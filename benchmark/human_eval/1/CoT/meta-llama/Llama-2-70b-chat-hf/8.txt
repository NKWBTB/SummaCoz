Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Amir Khan had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather in a $300 million mega-fight.
2. However, the article states that Khan had hoped to fight Adrien Broner, not Mayweather.
3. The article states but the pound-for-pound king(Mayweather) will instead meet Manny Pacquaio in a $300million mega-fight on May 2.
4. As the summary use the wrong information that is not included in article, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions that Amir Khan had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather in a $300million mega-fight, but Mayweather chose to fight Manny Pacquaio instead.
2. The article then mentions that Khan has set his sights on fighting Adrien Broner, a former three-weight world champion, who has recently expressed his willingness to fight Khan.
3. The article quotes Broner as saying that he would be ready to face Khan at the end of the month and that he hasn't taken any punishment in his recent fight against John Molina.
4. The article also mentions that Khan appeared to laugh off Broner's claims on Twitter before expressing his interest in fighting Broner.

Based on the information provided in the article, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article. The summary mentions that Khan had hoped to fight Mayweather, but since Mayweather is fighting Pacquaio instead, Khan is now interested in fighting Broner. The article provides information about Broner's willingness to fight Khan and Khan's interest in fighting Broner. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
