Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions that Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party, in alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), has won the departmental elections.
2. The article quotes Sarkozy as saying that "three years" under the Socialist party have brought the country to its knees, and the electorate has had enough.
3. The article notes that the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen has also highlighted the "failure" of the Socialists.
4. The article states that the election will choose 4,108 local councillors and shape the political landscape in the run-up to the 2017 presidential race.
5. The article mentions that the exit polls showed the UMP and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as President Hollande's Socialists.

Based on the information in the article, it appears that the summary "Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections" is consistent with the article. Therefore, my answer is yes.
