Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos.
2. However, the article states that Saleh is a defector who claims to have witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
3. The article does not mention Saleh appearing in any beheading videos.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Saleh is a participant in the beheadings, while the article portrays him as a witness.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article states that Saleh, a former member of ISIS, claimed to have witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
2. The article also states that Saleh worked as a translator for ISIS and was familiar with Jihadi John's activities.
3. The article mentions that Jihadi John was a senior figure in ISIS responsible for murdering foreign captives, according to Saleh.
4. The article describes how hostages were routinely subjected to mock executions, and how Jihadi John would reassure them that they would not be killed.
5. The article mentions that Saleh explained to the hostages that they were safe, but always knew they would be killed.

Based on the information provided in the article, it appears that Saleh was a member of ISIS who was familiar with Jihadi John's activities and was present during some of the beheading videos. Therefore, the summary statement "the man, named only as Saleh, appears in several beheading videos" is consistent with the information provided in the article.

Yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.
