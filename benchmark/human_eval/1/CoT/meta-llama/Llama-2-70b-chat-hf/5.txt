Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions a dispute between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton over Powell's plans to attend the Brit Awards.
2. The article states that the dispute was caused by Winterton's order for Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs.
3. The article reports that Powell backed down and took part in the vote, but still managed to attend the main Brit Awards event.
4. The article mentions that Winterton is in charge of party discipline and has a close relationship with John Prescott, who gave her her first break in politics.
5. The article notes that Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party's ranks and is tipped as a future Labour leader.

Based on the information in the article, it appears that there was a disagreement between Powell and Winterton over Powell's plans to attend the Brit Awards, and that this disagreement was related to Winterton's role in charge of party discipline and Powell's desire to attend the event. However, the article does not mention anything about "simmering tensions" between Miliband's ear, as stated in the summary. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Answer: No.
