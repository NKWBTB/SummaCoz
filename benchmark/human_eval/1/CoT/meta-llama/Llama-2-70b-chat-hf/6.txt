Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that "Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a court being involved in the attack.
2. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions that Plagad Somian, a Thai transvestite, attacked Katarzyna Pietrzycka, a Polish tourist, with a stiletto shoe.
2. The summary states that Katarzyna Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court.
3. The article does not mention anything about a court attacking Pietrzycka. Instead, it states that Somian attacked her with a stiletto.
4. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the article, as it incorrectly states that a court attacked Pietrzycka instead of a Thai transvestite named Somian.

Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article.
