Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary states that five ambitious clubs are vying for two Champions League places. The article mentions Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Southampton, and Tottenham as the five clubs in question.

The article discusses each team's current form, fixtures, and prospects of finishing in the top four. It mentions that Arsenal and Liverpool have been in good form, while Manchester United and Southampton have had scratchy performances. Tottenham is going through a mini-slump.

The article also mentions that the teams have three games left to play, and that the fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals. However, it also notes that the teams have difficult fixtures ahead, with five of the top seven to play for Manchester United and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton, and Newcastle.

Based on the information in the article, it appears that the five clubs are indeed in a close race for the two Champions League places. The article does not mention any other teams that are in contention for these spots, and it suggests that the race is likely to be decided in the final weeks of the season.

Therefore, the summary is consistent with the article, as it accurately reflects the information presented in the article.

Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
