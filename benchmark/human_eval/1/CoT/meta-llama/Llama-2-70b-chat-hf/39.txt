Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote onÂ Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions a quote on Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page that says, "It is better to die from vodka than from boredom."
2. The summary mentions the same quote, attributed to the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, and states it as the reason why Humberto and his friends were up for the drinking competition.
3. The article goes on to describe how Humberto died from alcohol poisoning after participating in the competition, and how the organisers are now facing charges of homicide.

Based on the above, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article. All the information in the summary is supported by the article, and the quote mentioned in the summary is accurately attributed to Mayakovsky. Therefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
