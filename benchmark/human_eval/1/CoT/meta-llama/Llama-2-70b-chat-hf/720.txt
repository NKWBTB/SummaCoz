Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article states that Natalia Moon moved to the Philippines in 2012, which is consistent with the summary.
2. The article states that Natalia Moon struggled to find work as an actress in Australia before moving to the Philippines, which is also consistent with the summary.
3. The article states that Natalia Moon learned Tagalog, the local language in the Philippines, in the hope of becoming a star, which is consistent with the summary.
4. The article states that Natalia Moon landed a major role in the sitcom "Ismol Family" in 2014, which is consistent with the summary.
5. The article states that Natalia Moon is also a model and has been featured on magazine covers in the Philippines, which is not mentioned in the summary.
6. The article states that Natalia Moon unsuccessfully auditioned for Asia's Got Talent, which is not mentioned in the summary.
7. The article states that Natalia Moon is nominated for Outstanding Breakthrough Performance By An Actress at the Golden Screen TV Awards, which is consistent with the summary.
8. The article states that the multi-talented youngster from Australia's top end is also embarking on a singing career, writing and performing songs in both English and Tagalog, which is consistent with the summary.

Based on the above points, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article.

Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
