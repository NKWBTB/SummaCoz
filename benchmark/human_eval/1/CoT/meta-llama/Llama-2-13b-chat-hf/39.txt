Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote onÂ Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Humberto Moura Fonseca, a 23-year-old student, died after attempting to drink 25 vodka shots in 60 seconds during a drinking competition at his university in Brazil.
2. The article quotes a friend of Humberto's, Rodrigo Pancetti, as saying that Humberto and the other students were "really up for" the drinking competition and that they were all having a great time.
3. The article also states that Humberto had a quote on his Facebook page that said "it is better to die from vodka than from boredom."
4. The article goes on to say that six other students also collapsed after drinking during the competition, and that medical crews rushed them to the hospital, where Humberto died on the way.
5. The article concludes by stating that police are looking to charge the organizers of the event with homicide, and that the university has banned drinking on campus.

Based on these points, here's my answer to the question:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the quote on Humberto's Facebook page, but it does not mention the drinking competition or the tragic events that occurred as a result. The summary is too brief and does not provide enough information to be considered consistent with the article.
