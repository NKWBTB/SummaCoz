Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos.
2. However, the article states that Saleh is a defector who claims to have witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
3. The article does not mention Saleh appearing in any beheading videos.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Saleh is a participant in the beheadings, while the article portrays him as a witness.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Saleh is a former member of the Islamic State who witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
2. The summary does not mention Saleh being a former member of the Islamic State or witnessing any beheadings. Instead, it only mentions that Saleh appears in several beheading videos.
3. The article provides specific details about Saleh's experiences and what he saw, such as the mock executions and the killing of Kenji Goto. The summary does not include any of these details.
4. Therefore, the summary does not provide all the information in the article and is not consistent with the article.

So, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.
