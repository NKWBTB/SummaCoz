Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions jim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special.
2. The original sentence in article is After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special.
3. The summary simply concatenate some words from the original sentence and discard the rest of words which express different meaning with article, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Scotland has won 60 caps during his nine-year international career.
2. The article quotes Jim Hamilton as saying that he believes the team is heading in the right direction under Vern Cotter.
3. The article mentions that Scotland has shown glimpses of what they can do and that their play has been a joy to behold.
4. The article states that Hamilton believes that the team is on the verge of something special.

Based on these points, here's my answer:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that Jim Hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special, which is not supported by the article. In fact, the article quotes Hamilton as saying that he believes the team is heading in the right direction and that they are on the verge of something special. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article.
