Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions five ambitious clubs are locked in a bid for two champions league places.
2. But in the article it never mentions the word 'bid', the truth in article is five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places.
3. As the summary has the word should not be contained, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that Arsene Wenger believes his team needs to target 72 points to secure a top-four finish.
2. The article also states that Louis van Gaal agrees with Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total.
3. The summary only mentions that five ambitious clubs are locked in a bid for two Champions League places.

Based on these points, here's my reasoning:

The summary does not mention the specific point total that Wenger and van Gaal believe is necessary for a top-four finish. Instead, it only mentions that five clubs are competing for two Champions League places. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the information about the point total.

So, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.
