Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the guard was shot in the abdomen, which is consistent with the summary.
2. The summary mentions that the shooter took police on a wild chase back into D.C., which is supported by the article.
3. The article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard, which is consistent with the summary.
4. The summary mentions that the guard died after being taken to a hospital, which is supported by the article.
5. The article states that the shooter was eventually shot by police, which is consistent with the summary.

Based on these points, I would say that the summary is consistent with the article. All of the information in the summary is supported by the article, and there are no major discrepancies or omissions. Therefore, the answer is:

Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
