Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal, saying that it does not roll back Iran's nuclear program and that Iran cannot be trusted to abide by its terms.
2. The article also mentions that Netanyahu has a frosty relationship with President Obama, and that his opposition to the deal has little to do with his personal feelings towards the President.
3. The article quotes Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein as saying that she wishes Netanyahu "would contain himself" and that negotiators are "on the cusp of something that can be workable."
4. The article also quotes Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz as defending the deal, saying that it would extend the "breakout" time period and allow for "almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal."
5. Finally, the article mentions that GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination have lambasted the deal, saying that it gives Iran too much flexibility.

Based on these points, here's my conclusion:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary implies that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, but the article provides information that suggests the deal is already being criticized and defended by various parties. The article mentions that Netanyahu has criticized the deal, while Feinstein and Moniz have defended it. Additionally, the article mentions that the deal is expected to be sent to Congress for approval, which suggests that it will indeed be used in some form. Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article.
