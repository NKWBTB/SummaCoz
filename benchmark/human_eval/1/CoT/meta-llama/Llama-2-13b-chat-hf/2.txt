Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain, a 24-year-old man, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the execution was stayed.

2. The article states that Shafqat Hussain, who was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. The article also mentions that Hussain's family claims he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and that he did not receive a fair trial.

3. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the stay of execution.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday.
2. However, the article also states that Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who claim that he did not get a fair trial and that he was tried as an adult despite being a juvenile at the time of the crime.
3. The article mentions that Hussain's family says he was 14 years old when he committed the crime, and that he was not provided with legal counsel during his trial.
4. The article also states that there has been an international outcry over Hussain's case, with human rights groups calling for his execution to be halted.
5. In response to this outcry, the Pakistani government has ordered a stay of execution for Hussain, and has announced that it will review his case for another 72 hours.

Based on these points, it is clear that the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The summary only mentions that Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, without providing any information about the controversy surrounding his case or the international outcry over his execution. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

So, the answer is NO. The summary is not consistent with the article.
