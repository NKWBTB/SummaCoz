Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the words "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are banned from gift messages on bouquets of flowers at Marks & Spencer.
2. The article also states that other banned words include "f***" and "gay", but that jihad, Buddha, and Allah are accepted.
3. The article quotes a spokesman for Marks & Spencer as saying that the automatic phrase checker includes hundreds of words of varying nature, and that Jesus and Christ are included to prevent their misuse.
4. The summary states that "k'' can also be included in messages.

Based on the information provided in the article, it appears that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions "k''", which is not mentioned in the article. Additionally, the article states that "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" are banned from gift messages, while the summary does not mention this. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.
