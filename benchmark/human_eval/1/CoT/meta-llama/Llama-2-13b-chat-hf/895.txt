Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming , who played for nba 's houston rockets from 2002 to 2011. But in the article it mentions mai zizhuo and yao ming are not the same person. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that the five-year-old child, Mai Zizhuo, has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, according to the People's Daily Online.
2. The summary does not mention this detail.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include this information.

So, the answer is: No, the summary is not consistent with the article.
