Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "those who receive Centrelink payments made up Radio Rental's income last year."
2. The article states that "Nearly half of the Radio Rentals customers have been found to be on welfare payments."
3. The article also states that "Of the $197 million of revenue they made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay."
4. Therefore, we can infer that the $90 million in revenue from Centrepay is made up of payments from Centrelink recipients.
5. The article also states that "Of that $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems and other home theatre devices."
6. This suggests that the Centrelink recipients who are renting household items from Radio Rentals are using their welfare payments to purchase entertainment items, which is a discretionary expense.

Based on these points, here is my answer:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions that Centrelink payments made up Radio Rentals' income last year, but the article provides additional information about the nature of those payments and how they are being used. Specifically, the article states that the $90 million in revenue from Centrepay is made up of payments from Centrelink recipients, and that a significant portion of that money is being used for discretionary entertainment items. This additional information is not present in the summary.
