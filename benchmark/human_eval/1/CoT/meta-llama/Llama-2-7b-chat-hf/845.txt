Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:

1. The summary mentions that the guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen, which is consistent with the article's mention of the guard being shot and critically wounded.
2. The summary states that the shooter took some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which is consistent with the article's mention of the shooter trying to ram the gates before firing at the guard and the subsequent chase by authorities.
3. The summary mentions that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, which is consistent with the article's mention of the shooter attempting to ram the gates before opening fire on the guard.
4. The summary states that the guard died before 10pm after being taken to a Washington area hospital, which is consistent with the article's mention of the guard dying after being taken to a hospital.
5. The summary mentions that the shooter's trail of violence continued back into D.C., which is consistent with the article's mention of the shooter's chase back into D.C. and the subsequent shooting of two police officers.

Based on these points, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes).
