Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions five ambitious clubs are locked in a bid for two champions league places.
2. But in the article it never mentions the word 'bid', the truth in article is five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places.
3. As the summary has the word should not be contained, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:

1. The summary mentions the same five clubs as the article: Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Southampton, and Tottenham.
2. The summary highlights the same challenge for these clubs as the article does: a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City.
3. The summary notes that the teams are "locked in a bid" for these places, which is similar language to the article's description of the situation as a "rat race."
4. The summary does not introduce any new information or perspectives that are not present in the article.

Therefore, the summary is consistent with the article and supports the information presented in the article.
