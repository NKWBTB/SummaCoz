Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:

1. The summary mentions "those who receive Centrelink payments" which is the same language used in the article to refer to customers of Radio Rentals.
2. The summary states that Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year, which is the same information provided in the article.
3. The summary mentions the amount of revenue generated by Radio Rentals from Centrelink payments, which is $90 million, the same amount mentioned in the article.
4. The summary highlights the reliance of Radio Rentals on revenue from the Australian welfare system, which is a key point in the article.
5. The summary quotes the Chief Executive Officer of Consumer Action Law Centre, Gerard Brody, who expresses concerns about the use of the Centrepay system by Radio Rentals and the consumer lease industry, which is also mentioned in the article.

Based on these points, it is clear that the summary accurately represents the information provided in the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is (yes) the summary is consistent with the article.
