Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos.
2. However, the article states that Saleh is a defector who claims to have witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
3. The article does not mention Saleh appearing in any beheading videos.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Saleh is a participant in the beheadings, while the article portrays him as a witness.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary mentions the name of the defector, Saleh, who is a former member of the Islamic State. The article also mentions Saleh as a defector who worked as a translator and witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
2. The summary states that Saleh appeared in several beheading videos. The article mentions that Saleh worked as a translator and witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage, which suggests that Saleh may have appeared in videos of the beheadings.
3. The summary mentions that Saleh revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come, they were not expecting to die. The article also mentions that ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, was a senior figure tasked with murdering foreign captives, and that he routinely subjected hostages to mock executions to make them believe they would not be killed.
4. The summary states that Saleh said Jihadi John won respect for murdering foreign prisoners. The article mentions that Jihadi John was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives, and that he was known for his brutality and efficiency in carrying out executions.
5. The summary mentions that hostages were given Arabic names to give them the impression they were among friends. The article also mentions that ISIS gave hostages Arabic names to make it appear like they were with friends and continually reassured them that they would not be killed.
6. The summary states that after Mr. Goto was killed, Saleh said three of four men put the body in the boot of a car and drive off, with Emwazi leaving in a different direction. The article mentions that after Jihadi John beheaded Kenji Goto, he was seen leaving in a different direction, suggesting that he may have been one of the men who put the body in the car.

Based on these similarities, it is clear that the summary is consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
