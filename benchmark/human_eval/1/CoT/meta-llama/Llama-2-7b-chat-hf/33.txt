Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary mentions the same number of chickens as the article - "thousands" - which is consistent with the article's mention of "34,000 chickens" being penned into a shed.
2. The summary mentions the same time frame as the article - "35 days" - which is consistent with the article's mention of the chickens being kept for "just 35 days before they are gassed."
3. The summary uses similar language as the article - "huge sheds" and "oppressive conditions" - which is consistent with the article's use of similar language to describe the conditions on the farms that supply KFC.
4. The summary does not mention any information that is not present in the article, such as the farmer's name or any specific details about the farm's location.

Overall, the summary accurately summarizes the information presented in the article, and there is no evidence to suggest that it is inconsistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is yes.
