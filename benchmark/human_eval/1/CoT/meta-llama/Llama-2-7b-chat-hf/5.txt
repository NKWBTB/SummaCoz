Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary mentions "insiders" who are quoted in the article, which suggests that the information in the summary is supported by direct quotes from sources within the Labour Party.
2. The summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, including the fact that a dispute between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton over an invitation to the Brit Awards flared up due to tensions between the two women.
3. The summary accurately captures the tone of the article, which is focused on the tensions between Powell and Winterton and their differing approaches to politics.
4. The summary does not include any information that is not present in the article, such as any additional details or context that might be relevant to the dispute.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, I would answer (yes) to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.
