Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary mentions "sarkozy's electoral alliance" winning departmental elections, which is supported by the article. The article states that the UMP party, led by Nicolas Sarkozy, won up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists.
2. The summary mentions "the failure of the Socialists," which is also supported by the article. The article highlights the electoral defeat of the Socialists, with exit polls showing that they lost 30 of the regional councils, and notes that the far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen called on Prime Minister Manuel Valls to resign.
3. The summary mentions "increased extremism in his country," which is supported by the article. The article notes that the election represented a key test for former president Nicolas Sarkozy, who is attempting to return to power in two years' time, and that the far-right FN leader Marine Le Pen highlighted the "failure" of the Socialists and noted increased extremism in the country.
4. The summary does not mention any information that is not supported by the article.

Therefore, the summary is consistent with the article.
