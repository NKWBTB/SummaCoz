Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary mentions that the deal does not roll back Iran's nuclear program and keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place, which is consistent with what Prime Minister Netanyahu said in the article. Netanyahu argued that the deal does not dismantle Iran's nuclear program and that thousands of centrifuges will continue to enrich uranium.
2. The summary also mentions that Iran is a country of "congenital cheating" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which is similar to what Netanyahu said in the article. Netanyahu expressed skepticism about Iran's ability to be trusted to comply with the deal, citing the country's history of cheating.
3. The summary mentions that some Democrats have expressed support for the deal, which is consistent with the article. In the article, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said she wishes Netanyahu "would contain himself" and that the negotiators working on the deal are "on the cusp of something that can be workable."
4. The summary also mentions that some Republicans have criticized the deal, which is consistent with the article. In the article, GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted the deal, saying it gave Iran too much flexibility.

Based on these points, the summary is consistent with the article. The summary accurately represents the main arguments and points made in the article, including those of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Sen. Feinstein, and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, as well as the criticisms from Republicans. Therefore, the answer is yes.
