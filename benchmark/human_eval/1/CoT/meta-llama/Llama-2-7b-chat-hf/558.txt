Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. The summary mentions "a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland" which is in line with the article's mention of "plans for automatic pardons" and "a motion in the assembly to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offences."
2. The summary states that the proposal has been "approved by the Northern Ireland assembly" which is supported by the article's mention of the minister confirming that the motion will go before the assembly for approval.
3. The summary mentions "gay and bisexual men" which is consistent with the article's mention of "men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences" and "living men convicted of such offences."
4. The summary does not mention any information that contradicts or is inconsistent with the article.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the article and the summary, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article.
