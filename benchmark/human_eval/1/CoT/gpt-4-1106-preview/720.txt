Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The summary states that Natalia Moon, 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines. The article confirms this by describing her as having a legion of adoring fans in Southeast Asia and being nominated for an award for her role in a sitcom.

Step 2: The summary mentions that she moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress. The article supports this by stating that she moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to hit the big time in Australia.

Step 3: The summary repeats the information about her moving to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress, which seems to be a redundancy in the summary but does not contradict the article.

The summary is consistent with the article, as all the information provided in the summary is supported by the article. However, there is a slight redundancy in the summary with the repeated mention of her move to the Philippines in 2012.

Answer: Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
