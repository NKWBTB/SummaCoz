Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary provided is a fragment and does not convey a complete thought. It seems to be an incomplete sentence that might be referring to the tensions between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, who are described in the article as both being rivals for Ed Miliband's ear. However, the summary does not accurately reflect the full context or details of the article. The article discusses a specific incident involving a dispute over attendance at the Brit Awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote, which brought the tensions between Powell and Winterton to a head. The summary fails to mention any of these key elements, such as the Brit Awards, the Commons vote, or the roles of Powell and Winterton.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not capture the essential information and is too vague and incomplete to represent the content of the article accurately.
