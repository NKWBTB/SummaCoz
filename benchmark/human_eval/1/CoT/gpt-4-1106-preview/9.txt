Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify the main subject of the article.
The article discusses the home built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie, which is up for sale.

Step 2: Clarify the timing of the home's inspection.
The article states that the home was opened for inspection just a day after Malcolm Fraser's sudden passing.

Step 3: Assess the accuracy of the summary statement.
The summary states that "the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing." This statement is incorrect. The home was not built for inspection; it was built for Malcolm Fraser and his wife and had been on the market since the previous year. The inspection occurred a day after his passing, but the construction of the home was not related to or timed for the inspection.

Step 4: Conclusion
The summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately suggests that the home was built for the purpose of an inspection following Malcolm Fraser's death, which is not supported by the information in the article.

Final Answer: No.
