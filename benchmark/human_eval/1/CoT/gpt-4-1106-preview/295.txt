Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The summary states that the catfish was named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, which is consistent with the article.

Step 2: The summary mentions that the fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil, which is also consistent with the article.

Step 3: The summary refers to the resemblance of the catfish to the first of the original Star Wars films. The article specifically mentions that the catfish was named after the character Greedo from Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which is the first installment of the original Star Wars films. This is consistent with the summary.

Step 4: The summary describes the new species of catfish, Peckoltia greedoi, as having large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty hunter Greedo. This is consistent with the article, which describes the catfish as having large dark eyes, protruding bristles, and a sucker mouth, and notes the resemblance to Greedo.

Step 5: The summary mentions "Han Solo - an extinct species found in southern China." This is a bit ambiguous because it doesn't specify what the extinct species is. The article mentions "Han solo - an extinct species of trilobite found in southern China," which clarifies that it is a trilobite that was named after the character Han Solo. The summary's omission of the word "trilobite" makes this point slightly inconsistent due to the lack of specificity.

Based on the analysis, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, but there is a minor inconsistency in the last point regarding the specificity of the extinct species named after Han Solo. The summary should have included the word "trilobite" to be fully consistent.

Final answer: No.
