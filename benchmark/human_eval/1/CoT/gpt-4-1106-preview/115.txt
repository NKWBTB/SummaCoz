Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions jim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special.
2. The original sentence in article is After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special.
3. The summary simply concatenate some words from the original sentence and discard the rest of words which express different meaning with article, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary suggests that Jim Hamilton is "a little detached from the reality of something special." However, the article portrays a different sentiment. It describes Jim Hamilton as having faith in the Scotland team despite their losses, and he maintains that the team is on the verge of something special. Hamilton, with his experience and optimism, believes that the team is heading in the right direction under coach Vern Cotter and cites the young talent in the team as a reason for optimism.

The article does not suggest that Hamilton is detached from reality; rather, it presents him as someone who acknowledges the team's current struggles but is confident about their potential and future success. He speaks about the team's progress and the positive signs they have shown, even in defeat, and expresses a genuine belief in the team's ability to improve and eventually succeed.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it misrepresents Jim Hamilton's outlook and confidence in the Scotland team's potential.

No, the summary is not consistent with the article.
