Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos.
2. However, the article states that Saleh is a defector who claims to have witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
3. The article does not mention Saleh appearing in any beheading videos.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Saleh is a participant in the beheadings, while the article portrays him as a witness.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:

Step 2: Determine what the summary claims about Saleh, which is that he appears in several beheading videos.
Step 3: Review the article to find any information about Saleh's role and whether he appears in beheading videos.
Step 4: The article mentions that Saleh is a former member of the Islamic State who worked as a translator and witnessed Jihadi John, also known as Mohammed Emwazi, beheading a Japanese hostage. Saleh is described as a defector who spoke to Sky News about his experiences.
Step 5: The article does not state that Saleh appears in any beheading videos. Instead, it describes his role as a translator and a witness to the events carried out by Jihadi John.
Step 6: Since the article does not support the claim that Saleh appears in several beheading videos, the summary is not consistent with the article.
