Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify the subject of the article.
The article is about a 39-year-old Star Wars fan named Mick Fett who has a vast collection of Star Wars memorabilia.

Step 2: Compare the subject of the article to the summary.
The summary mentions a "Star Wars actor" named John Fett, which is inconsistent with the article. The article does not mention an actor by that name but instead focuses on a collector named Mick Fett.

Step 3: Analyze the details provided in the summary.
The summary talks about being "overwhelmed" by the latest collection of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." The article does not mention "The Force Awakens" specifically, nor does it describe Mick Fett as being overwhelmed by a collection; instead, it mentions his girlfriend's initial reaction to his collection.

Step 4: Check for any direct quotes or references.
The summary does not include any direct quotes or references from the article.

Based on the analysis:
No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The name is incorrect, the focus on an actor is not present in the article, and the specific mention of "The Force Awakens" is not found in the article's content.
