Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The article discusses the Iran nuclear deal, which involves an agreement to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for Iran reducing its number of active centrifuges and limiting its highly enriched uranium, among other conditions.

Step 2: The article mentions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizes the deal, suggesting that there are better options than the deal or war. He proposes "standing firm, ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal."

Step 3: The article also includes information about the support for the deal from President Barack Obama and the criticism from GOP contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination.

Step 4: The article provides details on the deal's provisions, such as the reduction of centrifuges and the extension of the "breakout" time period, which is the time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb.

Step 5: The article does not contain any information suggesting uncertainty about the use of the deal in Iran. The debate is about the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the deal, not about whether it will be used.

Based on the steps above, the summary stating "it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in iran" is not consistent with the article. The article does not express any uncertainty about the implementation of the deal in Iran; rather, it discusses the differing opinions on the deal's terms and effectiveness.
