Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The article states that "those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year." This matches the information provided in the summary.

Step 2: The article provides specific figures, stating that of the $197 million of revenue Radio Rentals made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay. While the summary does not mention the exact figures, it does not contradict this information.

Step 3: The article mentions that $45 million of the $90 million from Centrepay was used for entertainment items. This detail is not included in the summary, but the absence of this information does not make the summary inconsistent with the article.

Step 4: The article discusses the reliance of Radio Rentals on the revenue from the Australian welfare system, which is implied in the summary by mentioning the significant portion of income derived from Centrelink payments.

Step 5: The article includes a quote from Gerard Brody of the Consumer Action Law Centre expressing concerns about Radio Rentals and the consumer lease industry's use of the Centrepay system. This is not mentioned in the summary, but again, the absence of this detail does not make the summary inconsistent.

Based on the steps above, the summary is consistent with the article as it does not contradict any of the information provided in the article. The summary captures the main point that a significant portion of Radio Rental's income is from those who receive Centrelink payments.
