The article identifies the attacker as Plagad Somian, a Thai transvestite.

Step 3: Identify the weapon used in the attack.
The article mentions that the attack was carried out with a stiletto shoe.

Step 4: Identify the location of the attack.
The attack took place in Pattaya, Thailand.

Step 5: Compare the article's information with the summary.
The summary states that Katarzyna Pietrzycka was attacked with a stiletto, which is consistent with the article. However, the summary incorrectly states that the attack was by a "Thai court," which is not supported by the article. The article clearly states that the attacker was a Thai transvestite, not a court.

Conclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the attacker as a "Thai court" instead of a Thai transvestite.
