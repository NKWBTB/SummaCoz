Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 Step 1: Identify the main points in the article.
- A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen and later died.

- The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard.
- The guard went to investigate a couple fighting in a car and was shot.
- The shooter was eventually shot several times in a chase that ended in D.C.

Step 2: Compare the main points in the article with the summary.
- The summary mentions the guard being shot in the abdomen.
- The summary mentions the shooter taking a wild chase back into D.C.
- The summary mentions the shooter trying to ram the gates before firing at the guard.
- The summary does not mention the guard going to investigate a couple fighting in a car.

Step 3: Determine if the summary is consistent with the article.
