Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 Step 1: Identify the main subject of the article - Radio Rentals and their revenue sources.
Step 2: Find the information about the main subject in the article - "Nearly half of the Radio Rentals customers have been found to be on welfare payments, and they are not just renting household necessities. The ABC have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year."
Step 3: Compare the summary with the information found in the article - The summary states that the ABC reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up Radio Rental's income last year.
Step 4: Determine if the summary is consistent with the article - The summary accurately reflects the information found in the article.

Answer: Yes, the summary is consistent with the corresponding article.
