Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 Step 1: Identify the main subject of the article - Natalia Moon.
Step 2: Identify the main event or achievement - becoming a TV sensation in the Philippines.
Step 3: Identify the reason for the event or achievement - moving to the Philippines in 2012 and learning the local language, Tagalog.
Step 4: Identify other relevant information - Natalia Moon's role in the sitcom 'Ismol Family', her award nomination, and her singing career.

Now, let's analyze the summary:

- Natalia Moon is the main subject.
- Becoming a TV sensation in the Philippines is the main event or achievement.
- Moving to the Philippines in 2012 is the reason for the event or achievement.

The summary does not mention Natalia Moon's role in the sitcom 'Ismol Family', her award nomination, and her singing career. These details are important to provide a complete understanding of the article.

Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.
