Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain, a 24-year-old man, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the execution was stayed.

2. The article states that Shafqat Hussain, who was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. The article also mentions that Hussain's family claims he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and that he did not receive a fair trial.

3. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the stay of execution.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.
