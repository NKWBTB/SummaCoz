Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 Step 1: Identify the main subject of the article and summary.
The article and summary are both about a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland.

Step 2: Check if the summary includes all the key information from the article.
The article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, which will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales. It also states that the proposals would see men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences receive posthumous pardons, and that the law will be called "Turing's Law." The minister has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offences.

Step 3: Compare the summary to the article to determine if it is consistent.
The summary includes the main subject of the article and mentions that the proposal has been approved by the Northern Ireland assembly. However, it does not mention the details about the motion going before the assembly, the connection to England and Wales, or the name of the law ("Turing's Law").

Conclusion: The summary is not entirely consistent with the article, as it does not include all the key information from the article.
