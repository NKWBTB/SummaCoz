Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Step 3: Determine if the summary is consistent with the article.
