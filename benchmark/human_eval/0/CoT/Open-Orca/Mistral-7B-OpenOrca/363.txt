Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
 Step 1: Identify the main topic of the article.
The article is about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's criticism of the Iran nuclear deal and his preference for a third alternative.

Step 2: Identify the main points of the article.
- Netanyahu criticizes the deal and believes there is a better alternative.
- The deal involves lifting Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for limiting its nuclear capabilities.
- President Obama endorses the deal, while GOP contenders criticize it.
- Netanyahu argues that the deal does not roll back Iran's nuclear program and cannot be trusted.
- Democratic and Republican politicians continue to debate the deal.

Step 3: Compare the main points of the article to the summary.
The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran. This statement is not supported by the article, as the article discusses the various opinions on the deal and Netanyahu's criticism, but does not mention whether the deal will be used or not.

Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.
