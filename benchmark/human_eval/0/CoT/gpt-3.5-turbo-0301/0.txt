Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article states that nearly half of Radio Rentals customers are on welfare payments.
2. The article states that $90 million of Radio Rentals' revenue came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay.
3. The article states that of the $90 million in expenditure, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems and other home theatre devices.
4. The article states that any change in the rules that regulate the consumer leasing industry would have a huge effect on Radio Rentals and their business.
5. The article explains that Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service offered by Centrelink and deducts welfare payments in manageable amounts in order to pay nominated bills.
6. The article states that Consumer Action Law Centre CEO Gerard Brody has expressed concerns about Radio Rentals and the consumer lease industry's use of the Centrepay system.
7. The article states that Radio Rentals is currently Australia's leading household appliance, technology and furniture rental company.

The summary accurately reflects point 1 in the article, but it does not mention the other key points about Centrepay, the amount of revenue generated, or the concerns raised by the Consumer Action Law Centre. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.
