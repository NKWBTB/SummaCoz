Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article. The article is about a man named Mick Fett who has a vast collection of Star Wars memorabilia and has created an alter ego called "Aussie Vader" by redecorating a Darth Vader costume with Australian elements. The article does not mention John Fett or his reaction to any Star Wars collection. Therefore, the answer is no.
