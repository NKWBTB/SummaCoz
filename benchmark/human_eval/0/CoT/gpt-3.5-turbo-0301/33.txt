Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article discusses the conditions on farms that supply KFC with chickens.
2. The images show tens of thousands of chickens kept together in huge sheds, alive for just 35 days before they are gassed.
3. The documentary focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows.
4. When they are large enough the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to warehouses in large trays where they are then distributed to branches nationwide.
5. The farmer in charge claimed the birds had 'a very good life' and showed how they were healthy.
6. Animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’.
7. A KFC spokesman said: ‘Animal welfare is essential for high quality food and is important to our customers, and all of KFC’s suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements.

The summary states that "the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed." This is consistent with information in the article, specifically point 2. Therefore, the answer is yes.
