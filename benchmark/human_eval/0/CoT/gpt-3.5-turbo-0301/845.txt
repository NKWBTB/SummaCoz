Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

4. The summary states that the guard went to investigate a couple fighting in a car and it cost him his life. This is consistent with the article, which states that the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and going to investigate.
