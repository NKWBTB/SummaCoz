Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article discusses a new species of catfish named Peckoltia greedoi after the Star Wars character Greedo.
2. The catfish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil.
3. The catfish has large dark eyes, protruding bristles, and a sucker mouth.
4. The name Peckoltia greedoi was chosen because of the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
5. The article mentions other species that have been named after Star Wars characters, including a trilobite named Han solo found in southern China.
6. The article emphasizes the importance of taxonomy in biology and the need for names to discuss the biology of organisms.

All information in the summary is supported by the article, so the answer is yes.
