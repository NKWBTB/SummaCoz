Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that "Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a court being involved in the attack.
2. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article describes an incident in Pattaya, Thailand where a transvestite attacked a Polish woman with a stiletto shoe.
2. The victim's name is Katarzyna Pietrzycka and she is 42 years old.
3. The attacker's name is Plagad Somian and she is 23 years old.
4. The attack was motivated by jealousy towards Marek Pietrzycka, Katarzyna's husband.
5. Katarzyna was left bleeding heavily from her head after being knocked to the ground by the attacker's shoe.
6. The attacker was arrested and charged with causing bodily harm.
7. Katarzyna was taken to the hospital for treatment and is now recovering.

The summary only mentions one aspect of the article, which is that Katarzyna Pietrzycka was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court. This is not a complete or accurate summary of the article, as it leaves out important details such as the identity of the attacker, the motive for the attack, and the aftermath of the incident. Therefore, the answer is no.
