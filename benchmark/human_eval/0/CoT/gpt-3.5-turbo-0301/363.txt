Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article discusses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's criticism of the deal six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions.
2. Netanyahu sees a third alternative to "this bad deal or war," which is standing firm and ratcheting up the pressure until a better deal is reached.
3. Democrats and Republicans are sparring over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections.
4. President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, while GOP contenders for the party's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it.
5. Netanyahu argues that the deal does not roll back Iran's nuclear program and that it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place.
6. Netanyahu says Iran is a country of "congenital cheating" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal.
7. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California wishes Netanyahu "would contain himself" and says negotiators are "on the cusp of something that can be workable."
8. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defends the deal, saying it would extend from two months to one year the "breakout" time period.
9. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, says the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a "new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama."
10. The summary that "it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran" is not consistent with the article. Therefore, the answer is no.
