Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify the main subject of the summary, which is the victory of Sarkozy's electoral alliance in departmental elections.

Step 2: Verify this information against the article. The article states that "Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party" won the departmental elections, controlling up to 70 departments compared to 37 for the Socialists.

Step 3: Confirm the existence of an electoral alliance. The article mentions that Sarkozy referred to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI).

Step 4: Check if the victory is attributed to the alliance as a whole. The article quotes Sarkozy saying, "Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments," which implies that the victory is indeed attributed to the alliance between the UMP and UDI.

Step 5: Conclude whether the summary is consistent with the article. The summary's statement that "Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections" is supported by the article's information about the UMP's victory and the mention of the alliance with the UDI.

The answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
