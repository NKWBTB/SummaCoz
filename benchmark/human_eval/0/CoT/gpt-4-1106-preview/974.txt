Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify the main points in the summary regarding Wilshere and Parlour's comments.
- The summary states that Parlour says Wilshere's fitness record is holding him back.
- It mentions that Wilshere is a very good and technically gifted player.
- It notes that Wilshere has a great attitude and work ethic.
- It concludes that Wilshere has a great future.

Step 2: Cross-reference these points with the article.
- The article does mention that Parlour believes Wilshere's fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his potential.
- The article quotes Parlour saying, "I think heâ€™s the future of the club," which supports the summary's claim that Wilshere has a great future.
- However, the article does not directly quote Parlour praising Wilshere's technical skills, attitude, or work ethic.

Step 3: Determine if the summary's points are supported by the article.
- While the article supports the claim about Wilshere's fitness record and potential future, it does not provide evidence for the specific praises of being "very good," "technically gifted," or having a "great attitude" and "work ethic."

Conclusion: The summary includes specific praises of Wilshere that are not directly supported by the article. Therefore, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article.
