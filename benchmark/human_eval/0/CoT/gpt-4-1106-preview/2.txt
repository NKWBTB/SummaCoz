Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain, a 24-year-old man, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the execution was stayed.

2. The article states that Shafqat Hussain, who was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. The article also mentions that Hussain's family claims he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and that he did not receive a fair trial.

3. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the stay of execution.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify the key information in the summary regarding the scheduled execution of Shafqat Hussain. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday.

Step 2: Cross-reference this key information with the details provided in the article. The article mentions that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, not Wednesday. This is a clear discrepancy between the summary and the article.

Step 3: Determine if the summary is consistent with the article based on the discrepancy found. Since the summary incorrectly states the day of the scheduled execution, it is not consistent with the information provided in the article.

Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.
