Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify the key points in the article.
- Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval.
- The move will align Northern Ireland with England and Wales, where automatic pardons were announced.
- The law is referred to as 'Turing's Law' and applies to men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences.
- The motion will allow for posthumous pardons and for living men to apply for a pardon.
- The minister has secured executive agreement for the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion.
- The minister aims to bring in arrangements "as soon as possible" for equal treatment.
- The motion will go forward for consideration by the assembly.

Step 2: Compare the summary to the article.
- The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
- The article, however, mentions that the motion will go before the assembly for approval, not that it has already been approved.

Step 3: Conclusion
- The summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the proposal has been approved when, according to the article, it is only set to go before the assembly for consideration.
