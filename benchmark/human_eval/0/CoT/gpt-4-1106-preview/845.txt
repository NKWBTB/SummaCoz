Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The summary states that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The article confirms this by mentioning that a guard was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters.

Step 2: The summary mentions that the shooter took some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. The article supports this by describing how the shooter led police on a chase back into Washington D.C. that ended on a busy Northeast Washington street.

Step 3: The summary states that the chase ended when the shooter rammed the front gates. However, the article specifies that the chase ended when officers shot the suspect on a busy street after boxing in his vehicle. The ramming of the gates occurred earlier, before the guard was shot, not at the end of the chase.

Step 4: The summary correctly notes that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The article supports this by saying the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard.

Step 5: The summary says that the guard went to investigate a couple fighting in a car and it cost him his life. The article confirms this by stating that the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate.

Based on the steps above, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, but there is a discrepancy in the sequence of events regarding the ramming of the gates and the end of the chase. The summary incorrectly suggests that the chase ended with the ramming of the gates, while the article clarifies that the ramming occurred earlier and the chase ended with the suspect being shot on a street.
