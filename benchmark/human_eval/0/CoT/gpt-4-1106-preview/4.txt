Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
Step 1: The summary contains a censored word that appears to be a derogatory term. The article mentions that certain words are banned from being used in gift messages by Marks & Spencer, including 'f***' and 'gay'.

Step 2: The article does not explicitly state that the censored word in the summary is allowed in messages. Instead, it lists 'terrorist' and 'd**k' as examples of words that can be included in messages.

Step 3: The summary does not match the information provided in the article regarding which words are allowed and which are not. The article does not confirm that the specific censored word in the summary is permissible in gift messages.

Step 4: The summary is not consistent with the article because it suggests that a word is allowed in messages, but the article does not support this claim.
