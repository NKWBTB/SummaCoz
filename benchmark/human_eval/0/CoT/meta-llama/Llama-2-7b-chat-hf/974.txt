Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:

1. The summary mentions Mesut Ozil's new Apple Watch, which is consistent with the article's mention of Ozil visiting an Apple store on Thursday afternoon.
2. The summary quotes Ray Parlour as saying that Wilshere's fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his potential, which is consistent with the article's mention of Wilshere's injury record and Parlour's comment that the big question mark is whether Wilshere can stay fit.
3. The summary mentions Wilshere's training at London Colney, which is consistent with the article's mention of Wilshere being pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week.

Based on these points, the summary provides accurate and consistent information with the article. Therefore, the answer is (yes) the summary is consistent with the article.
