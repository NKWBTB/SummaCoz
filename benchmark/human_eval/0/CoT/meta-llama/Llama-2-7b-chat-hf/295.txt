Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:

1. The article mentions the discovery of a new species of catfish in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the fish being discovered in Brazil.
2. The article explains that the new species of catfish, Peckoltia greedoi, has large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty hunter Greedo from the Star Wars films, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the fish's resemblance to Greedo.
3. The article also mentions that the name Peckoltia greedoi was chosen because of the fish's resemblance to Greedo, which is consistent with the summary's mention of the biologists naming the fish after the Star Wars character.
4. The article does not mention any inconsistencies or contradictions in the summary, which suggests that the summary is accurate and consistent with the article.

Therefore, I answer (yes) to the question: Is the summary consistent with the article?
