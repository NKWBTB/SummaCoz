Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:

1. The article mentions that the words "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" have been placed on a list of banned words by Marks & Spencer, and customers who try to add a free message containing them are prevented from completing their order.
2. The summary also mentions that these words are included in the list of banned words, and that they cannot be used in gift messages.
3. The article quotes Lord Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, as saying that if "Christ becomes an offensive word in a Christian land then all of us should be alarmed."
4. The summary does not mention any contradictions or inconsistencies in the article's information.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the article and the summary, it can be concluded that the summary is consistent with the article.
