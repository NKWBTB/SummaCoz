Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the London Film Festival, its director and a record of people's attendance.
2. However, there is no mention of the London Film Festival in the article.
3. The article is about a film called "Turning Points" and its director, Chris Tally Evans, who is from Rhayader, Powys. The article discusses the film's premiere at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and its inclusion in the London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that Turning Points is a film produced and directed by Chris Tally Evans, and that it explores the moment when six people's lives change forever.
2. The article states that Sir Roger talks about how a dialogue coach helped boost his confidence, which helped him forge his career.
3. The article mentions that the film has been made for the London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event.
4. The article states that the film premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and will be shown at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre near Rhayader.
5. The article mentions that the film features stories from six people, including Sir Roger, Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, artist Ellen Jackman, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, and filmmaker Chris Tally Evans himself.
6. The article states that the film has been made with the support of the Arts Council of Wales.

Now, based on the information provided in the article, here's my answer to the question:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions nothing about the film Turning Points, the London 2012 Festival, or the stories of the six people featured in the film. Instead, it only mentions that a record 25,000 people attended the London Film Festival in September, which is not related to the content of the article.
