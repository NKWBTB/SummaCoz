Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Amir Khan had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather in a $300 million mega-fight.
2. However, the article states that Khan had hoped to fight Adrien Broner, not Mayweather.
3. The article states but the pound-for-pound king(Mayweather) will instead meet Manny Pacquaio in a $300million mega-fight on May 2.
4. As the summary use the wrong information that is not included in article, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Amir Khan had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather in a $300 million mega-fight.
2. However, Mayweather will instead face Manny Pacquiao in a mega-fight on May 2.
3. Khan has now set his sights on facing Adrien Broner, who is considered by many to be the new Mayweather.
4. Broner has said he is ready to fight Khan at the end of this month, and has even suggested he would be prepared to come to England to fight him.

Based on these points, here is my answer to the question:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions Khan's hopes to fight Mayweather, but the article states that he has set his sights on fighting Broner instead. Additionally, the summary does not mention Broner's name or his readiness to fight Khan, which are key points in the article.
