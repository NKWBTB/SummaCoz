Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party controlled up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists."
2. The article also states that "the UMP and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as President Hollande's Socialists."
3. Based on these statements, it appears that Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won the departmental elections.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the summary consistent with the article?" is:

Yes. The summary accurately reflects the information in the article, which states that Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won the departmental elections.
