Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that the catfish was named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History.
2. The article mentions that the fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil.
3. The article notes that the new species of catfish, Peckoltia greedoi, has large eyes and a sucker mouth, which resembles the bounty hunter Greedo from the Star Wars films.
4. The article mentions that Han Solo is an extinct species found in southern China.

Based on these points, here's my answer:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions the catfish being named by biologists and its discovery in Brazil, but it does not mention the resemblance to Greedo or any other Star Wars references. The article provides more details about the species' characteristics and the naming process, as well as references to other Star Wars-inspired species named by the same biologists.
