Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the home was open for inspection "just a day after his sudden passing."
2. The article does not mention the home being built for inspection. Instead, it states that the home was built for the former prime minister and his wife.
3. The summary does not mention the home being built for the Frasers, only that it was open for inspection.

Based on these points, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The article provides information about the history of the home and its current status, while the summary only mentions the home being open for inspection. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.
