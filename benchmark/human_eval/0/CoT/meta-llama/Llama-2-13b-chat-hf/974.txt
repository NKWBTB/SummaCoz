Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that Ray Parlour believes Jack Wilshere's fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield.
2. The summary does not mention anything about Wilshere's fitness record being a concern. Instead, it highlights his technical ability and work ethic.
3. Therefore, the summary does not support the information in the article about Parlour's concerns about Wilshere's fitness.

So, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary does not include information about Wilshere's fitness record, which is a key point in the article.
