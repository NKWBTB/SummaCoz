Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval.
2. The motion is expected to contain the same provisions as the proposals announced last month in England and Wales, which include posthumous pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences and the ability for living men to apply for pardons.
3. The article quotes the minister as saying that the motion will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales and allow for equal treatment of gay and bisexual men.
4. The article states that the motion will be brought forward for consideration by the assembly.

Based on these points, here's my answer:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary states that the proposal has been approved by the Northern Ireland assembly, which is not mentioned in the article. The article only states that the motion will be brought forward for consideration by the assembly, but does not mention approval. Additionally, the summary does not mention the specific provisions of the motion, such as posthumous pardons and the ability for living men to apply for pardons, which are mentioned in the article.
