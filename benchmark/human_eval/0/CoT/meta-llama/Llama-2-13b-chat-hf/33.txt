Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning:

1. The article states that the chickens are kept in huge sheds with few windows, and they live together with tens of thousands of other chickens.
2. The article also states that the chickens are gassed after just 35 days.
3. The summary only mentions that the chickens live together in huge sheds, but it does not mention the fact that they are gassed after 35 days.

Based on these points, I would say that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not include the information about the chickens being gassed after 35 days. The summary only provides a general overview of the living conditions of the chickens, but it does not provide a complete picture of their fate.

Therefore, my answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article.
