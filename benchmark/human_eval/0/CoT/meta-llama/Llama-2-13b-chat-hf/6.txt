Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that "Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai court." This is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of a court being involved in the attack.
2. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the attacker was a Thai transvestite named Plagad Somian, while the summary only mentions a "Thai court."
2. The article explains that Somian attacked Katarzyna Pietrzycka with a stiletto shoe, causing her to bleed heavily from her head. The summary does not mention the weapon used in the attack.
3. The article states that Somian was arrested and charged with causing bodily harm, while the summary does not mention any legal consequences for the attacker.
4. The article provides a quote from a police spokesman, stating that Somian admitted attacking Pietrzycka in a fit of rage at being slighted, and that she has been charged with causing bodily harm. The summary does not include any information about the attacker's motivation or legal status.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary omits important details about the attack, such as the weapon used and the legal consequences for the attacker, and includes inaccurate information about the attacker being a "Thai court." Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article.
