Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article mentions that Mick Fett, a 39-year-old man from Australia, has a vast collection of Star Wars memorabilia worth A$500,000.
2. The collection includes life-size statues, vintage toys, and even a pod-racer in the backyard.
3. Mick Fett has a room dedicated to arcade games and another room filled with Star Wars costumes.
4. He has a custom-made Darth Vader costume with an Australian flag cape and beer cans on his belt.
5. He has seen the new Star Wars film Rogue One twice, once at the red carpet premiere and again at a midnight screening with fans.

Now, let's compare the summary with the article:

1. The summary mentions "star wars actor john fett" and "the force awakens," but the article does not mention anything about John Fett being an actor or the Force Awakens.
2. The summary does not mention anything about Mick Fett's collection of Star Wars memorabilia or his home filled with Star Wars decorations.
3. The summary does not mention anything about Mick Fett's room dedicated to arcade games or his custom-made Darth Vader costume.
4. The summary does not mention anything about Mick Fett seeing the new Star Wars film Rogue One.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary mentions none of the details that are actually in the article, and instead introduces a new character named John Fett and mentions the Force Awakens, which are not present in the article. Therefore, the answer is NO, the summary is not consistent with the article.
