Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that there was a dispute between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, two powerful women in Ed Miliband's inner circle, over an invitation to the Brit Awards.
2. The dispute allegedly brought simmering tensions between the two women to a head, as they have contrasting styles and approaches to politics.
3. The article mentions that Powell, who is tipped as a future Labour leader, wanted to attend the Brit Awards pre-party where guests mingle with pop stars, but Winterton, who is in charge of party discipline, ordered her to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband.
4. The argument intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the "second jobs" debate was partly the responsibility of Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her.
5. In the end, Powell backed down and took part in the vote, but still managed to attend the main Brit Awards event.

Based on the information provided in the article, here is my answer to the question:

No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary only mentions "simmering tensions" between the two women, but the article provides specific details about the dispute over the Brit Awards invitation and the intensifying argument between them. The summary does not convey the same level of conflict and specific details as the article.
