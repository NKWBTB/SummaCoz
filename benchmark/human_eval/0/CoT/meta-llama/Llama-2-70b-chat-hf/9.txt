Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The summary states that the home was built for inspection just a day after Malcolm Fraser's sudden passing.
2. The article mentions that the home, known as JM Fraser House, was open for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
3. The article also states that the property has been on the market since October last year, but the real estate agent, Bill Lyristakis, has hopes that it will sell today.
4. The summary does not mention the property's history, design, or previous owners, which are discussed in the article.

Based on the above points, it seems that the summary is consistent with the article, as it accurately reports the fact that the home was open for inspection just a day after Malcolm Fraser's passing, and does not include any information that is not supported by the article.

Therefore, my answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
