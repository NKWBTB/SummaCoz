Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions that certain words, including "Christ" and "Jesus Christ," are banned from being used in gift messages on bouquets of flowers purchased from Marks & Spencer.
2. The article states that an automatic phrase checker is in place to prevent the use and misuse of certain words, and that the words "Jesus" and "Christ" are included in this list to prevent their misuse.
3. The summary states that "** k" can also be included in messages.
4. The article does not mention anything about the word "** k" being banned or allowed in gift messages.

Based on the above reasoning, I would answer "no" to the question of whether the summary is consistent with the corresponding article. The summary contains information that is not supported by the article, specifically the mention of the word "** k" being allowed in messages.
