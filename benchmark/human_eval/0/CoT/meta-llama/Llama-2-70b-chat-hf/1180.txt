Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions John Fett, a 39-year-old man who has amassed a vast collection of Star Wars merchandise, including a life-size Han Solo carbonite statue, priceless vintage toys, and a vast collection of creatures from across the galaxy.
2. The article states that Fett's collection fills his five-bedroom home, which he shares with his girlfriend, and is estimated to be worth A$500,000 (Â£300,000; $370,000).
3. The article mentions that Fett has a passion for dressing up in Star Wars costumes and has created a unique Australian-themed Darth Vader costume, which has become a hit both at home and abroad.
4. The article states that Fett has already seen the new Star Wars film Rogue One twice, once at the red carpet premiere and again at a midnight screening with fans.
5. The summary, on the other hand, states that John Fett is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that John Fett is a passionate Star Wars fan who has amassed a vast collection of merchandise and has created a unique Australian-themed Darth Vader costume. However, there is no mention in the article of Fett being "overwhelmed" by the latest collection of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.

Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.
