Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article mentions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal struck by six world powers to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions, saying that he sees better options than "this bad deal or war."
2. Netanyahu argues that the deal does not roll back Iran's nuclear program, keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place, and allows thousands of centrifuges to keep spinning, enriching uranium.
3. The article quotes Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein as saying that she wishes Netanyahu "would contain himself" and that negotiators working on the deal are "on the cusp of something that can be workable."
4. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defends the deal, saying it would extend the "breakout" time period from two months to one year and allow for the "almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal."
5. Sen. Lindsey Graham argues that the best option for the United States is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a "new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of Obama."

Based on the information in the article, it appears that there is a debate over the Iran nuclear deal, with Netanyahu and some Republicans opposing it and Democrats and the Obama administration supporting it. However, it is not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran, as the article does not provide information on the current status of the deal or whether it has been implemented. Therefore, my answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.
