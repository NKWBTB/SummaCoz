Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Yes, the summary is consistent with the article. Here's my reasoning:

1. The summary states that the guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen, which is consistent with the article's report that the guard was shot and critically wounded outside the headquarters.
2. The summary mentions that the shooter took police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which is supported by the article's statement that the shooter led police on a chase that ended in Northeast Washington.
3. The summary states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard, which is consistent with the article's report that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once.
4. The summary mentions that the guard died, which is consistent with the article's report that the guard died before 10pm after being taken to a Washington area hospital.
5. The summary does not mention any details about the shooter's motive or identity, which is consistent with the article's lack of information on these topics.

Overall, the summary accurately summarizes the main points of the article, and all the information in the summary is supported by the article. Therefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
