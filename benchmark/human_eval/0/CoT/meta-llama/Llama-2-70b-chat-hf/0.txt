Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article states that "those who receive Centrelink payments made up half of Radio Rental's income last year."
2. The summary states that "the ABC have reported that those who receive Centrelink payments made up Radio Rental's income last year."
3. The summary accurately paraphrases the information from the article, using slightly different wording.
4. Therefore, the summary is consistent with the article.

Answer: Yes, the summary is consistent with the article.
