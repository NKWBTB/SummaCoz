Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  My reasoning is as follows:

1. The article states that Justice Minister Claire Sugden has confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, which aims to bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales regarding automatic pardons for men convicted of now-abolished sexual offenses.
2. The article mentions that the motion is expected to contain the same provisions as the proposals in England and Wales, which include posthumous pardons for those convicted of such offenses, as well as the ability for living men to apply for a pardon.
3. The article quotes the minister saying that she has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offenses, and that arrangements will be brought in "as soon as possible" to ensure equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland as in England and Wales.
4. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offenses in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.

Based on the information in the article, it seems that the proposal has not yet been approved by the assembly, but rather, a motion will go before the assembly for approval. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article.
