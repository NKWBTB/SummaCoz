Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos.
2. However, the article states that Saleh is a defector who claims to have witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
3. The article does not mention Saleh appearing in any beheading videos.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Saleh is a participant in the beheadings, while the article portrays him as a witness.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article. The article mentions Jihadi John as the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos, not Saleh. Saleh is a former member of the Islamic State who witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage and provided information about the routine mock executions of hostages. Therefore, the summary is incorrect and not supported by the article.
