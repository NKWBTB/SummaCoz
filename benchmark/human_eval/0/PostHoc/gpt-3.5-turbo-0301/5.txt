Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it is too vague and does not accurately reflect the main point of the article. The article is about a feud between two powerful women in Ed Miliband's inner circle, Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. The feud brought simmering tensions between the two women to a head, as they are both rivals for Miliband's ear. The article provides details about the dispute, including the desire of Lucy Powell to attend the Brits pre-party, and the order from Rosie Winterton for her to stay at Westminster for the vote. The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the 'second jobs' debate was partly the responsibility of Labour's Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Powell backed down and took part in the vote, but still managed to attend the main Brits Awards event. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it does not accurately reflect the main point of the article.
