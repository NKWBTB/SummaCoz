Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one aspect of the conditions on the farms that supply KFC with chickens. While it is true that the chickens are kept in huge sheds and are gassed after 35 days, the summary does not mention the fact that they live in conditions that animal rights activists consider oppressive, or that many of them die from starvation or dehydration. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and does not accurately reflect the information presented in the article.
