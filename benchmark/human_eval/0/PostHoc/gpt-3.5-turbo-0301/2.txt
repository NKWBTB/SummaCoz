2. The article states that Shafqat Hussain, who was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. The article also mentions that Hussain's family claims he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and that he did not receive a fair trial.

3. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the stay of execution.

1. The article states that Shafqat Hussain was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, but the summary does not mention this crucial detail.

2. The article explains that Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. The summary does not mention this context.

3. The article explains that Hussain's case has received attention due to Pakistan's decision to lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases, not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. The summary does not mention this context.

4. The article explains that Hussain's case has received international attention, with the European Union releasing a statement calling for Pakistan to reinstitute the moratorium and respect its international obligations. The summary does not mention this context.
