Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one aspect of the article, which is the opening of the home for inspection after Malcolm Fraser's passing. However, the article also talks about the history of the home, its design, location, and sale status. Additionally, the article provides information about Malcolm Fraser's life and death, which is not mentioned in the summary. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and not consistent with the article.
