Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The article discusses the deal that six world powers struck to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal, saying he sees better options than "this bad deal or war." However, President Barack Obama endorsed the deal, saying it was better than the alternatives. The article also mentions that the deal would lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal, saying it would extend from two months to one year the "breakout" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb. Therefore, the summary that "it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran" is not consistent with the article as the article discusses the details of the deal and how it aims to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb.
