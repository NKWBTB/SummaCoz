Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote onÂ Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions a quote from Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page, while the article provides more information about his death and the drinking competition that led to it. The article states that Humberto died after attempting to drink 25 vodka shots in 60 seconds during a drinking competition at the university of Julio de Mesquita in Brazil. The article also mentions that several other students were hospitalized with alcohol poisoning and that the organizers of the event may face charges of homicide. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and does not accurately reflect the main points of the article.
