Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions five ambitious clubs are locked in a bid for two champions league places.
2. But in the article it never mentions the word 'bid', the truth in article is five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places.
3. As the summary has the word should not be contained, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one aspect of the article's content. The article discusses the race for the top four spots in the Premier League, which will secure Champions League qualification, and the estimated number of points needed to achieve this. The article also mentions the financial and competitive implications of not qualifying for the Champions League. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and does not accurately reflect the main points of the article.
