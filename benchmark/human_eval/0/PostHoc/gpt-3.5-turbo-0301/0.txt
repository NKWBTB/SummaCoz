Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions one aspect of the information provided in the article. The article states that nearly half of Radio Rentals' customers are on welfare payments and that $90 million of their revenue came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay. Of that $90 million, $45 million was used for entertainment items such as flat screen televisions, smart phones, sound systems, and other home theatre devices. The article also mentions that any change in the rules that regulate the consumer leasing industry would have a huge effect on Radio Rentals and their business. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it only mentions one aspect of the information provided.
