Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The given summary is not consistent with the article. The article talks about Marks & Spencer banning the words 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' in gift messages for bouquets of flowers. The article also mentions that other banned words include 'f***' and 'gay', but some terms like jihad, Buddha, and Allah are accepted. The article further states that despite being made aware of the issue, M&S has not changed the facility yet. The article does not mention anything about the word 'k'' being included in messages. Therefore, the given summary is not consistent with the article.
