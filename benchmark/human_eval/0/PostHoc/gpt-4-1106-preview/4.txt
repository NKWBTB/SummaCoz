Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary provided contains a censored version of a word that appears to be an expletive or inappropriate term. However, the article does not mention that this specific word is allowed in gift messages. Instead, the article lists other words that are banned and some that are accepted. The words that are explicitly mentioned as banned include 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ,' along with expletives like 'f***' and 'gay.' The article also mentions that terms like 'jihad,' 'Buddha,' and 'Allah' are accepted, and that 'terrorist' and 'd**k' can be included in messages.

The inconsistency lies in the fact that the summary suggests a specific word (represented by "** k'' which seems to imply a censored word) is allowed in messages, but the article does not support this claim. The article does not provide any information about the specific word in the summary being permissible in gift messages. Therefore, the summary introduces information that is not present in the article, leading to inconsistency.
