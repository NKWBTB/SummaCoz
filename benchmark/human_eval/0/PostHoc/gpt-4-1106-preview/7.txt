Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that the man named Saleh appears in several beheading videos.
2. However, the article states that Saleh is a defector who claims to have witnessed Jihadi John beheading a Japanese hostage.
3. The article does not mention Saleh appearing in any beheading videos.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that Saleh is a participant in the beheadings, while the article portrays him as a witness.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The article discusses a former member of the Islamic State named Saleh who claimed to have witnessed the beheading of a Japanese hostage by Jihadi John, also known as Mohammed Emwazi.

2. The article describes Saleh's role as a translator and defector who provided insights into the practices of ISIS, including the mock executions and psychological manipulation of hostages.

3. The article does not state that Saleh appears in any beheading videos. Instead, it is Jihadi John who is described as the masked militant appearing in several beheading videos.

4. The summary incorrectly attributes the appearance in beheading videos to Saleh, which is not supported by the article. The article clearly identifies Jihadi John as the individual seen in the videos, not Saleh.

5. Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the summary's false claim that Saleh appears in several beheading videos, which contradicts the information provided in the article.
