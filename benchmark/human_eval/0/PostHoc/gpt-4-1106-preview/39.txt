Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote onÂ Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the attribution of the quote to "the Russian." The article mentions that on Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page, there is a quote from the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky which says, "it is better to die from vodka than from boredom." The summary incorrectly shortens this to "the Russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom," which could be misleading in several ways:

1. The phrase "the Russian" is vague and could imply that the sentiment is a common Russian saying or proverb, which the article does not claim.

2. The summary does not specify that the quote is from Vladimir Mayakovsky, who was a specific individual, a Russian poet, and not a general representation of Russian people or culture.

3. The summary omits the context in which the quote was mentioned, which is that it was found on Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page and not directly stated by Mayakovsky in the context of the incident.

4. The summary fails to convey that the quote was mentioned as an ironic twist to the tragic event that unfolded, rather than as a statement advocating for the behavior that led to Fonseca's death.

Therefore, the summary does not accurately reflect the information provided in the article regarding the quote and its source.
