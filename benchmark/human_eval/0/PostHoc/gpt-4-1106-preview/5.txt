Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear.
2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary provided is not consistent with the article for several reasons:

1. The summary is incomplete and does not make sense grammatically. It states, "insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between miliband's ear," which is a fragment and does not convey a complete thought. It seems to be missing key information that would make it a coherent sentence.

2. The article discusses a feud between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, two powerful women in Ed Miliband's inner circle. The summary does not mention either of these individuals or the nature of their dispute.

3. The article provides details about the cause of the feud, which was a disagreement over Lucy Powell's plans to attend the Brit Awards pre-party on the night of a crucial Commons vote. The summary does not reference this event or the disagreement.

4. The article mentions that the argument was related to a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs from having second jobs and that Powell was part of the Shadow Cabinet Office team responsible for this debate. The summary does not include any of this context.

5. The article includes quotes and opinions from sources, such as Rosie Winterton's alleged comment to Lucy Powell about hobnobbing with Madonna and others at the Brit Awards. The summary does not capture any of these details.

6. The article concludes with a statement from a Labour spokesman denying the allegations of a feud. The summary does not reflect this denial or the official stance of the Labour Party.

In summary, the provided summary fails to accurately represent the content of the article, omitting key details about the individuals involved, the nature of the dispute, and the official response from the Labour Party.
