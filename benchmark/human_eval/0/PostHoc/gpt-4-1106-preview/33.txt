Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The inconsistency in the summary arises from the phrase "the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed." This phrase suggests that the chickens are gassed while still in the sheds, which is not supported by the information in the article. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that the chickens are kept in huge sheds for 35 days, which is consistent with the summary.

2. However, the article then describes the process by which the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces, and sent to warehouses in large trays. This implies that the gassing and processing of the chickens occur after they have been removed from the sheds, not while they are still in them.

3. The article does not provide any information that the gassing happens within the sheds where the chickens live. Instead, it suggests a sequence of events where the chickens are first raised in the sheds and then later processed after they are large enough.

4. The summary's phrasing could mislead readers into thinking that the gassing occurs as part of the living conditions within the sheds, which is not the case according to the article.

Therefore, the inconsistency lies in the implication of where and when the gassing occurs, which is not accurately reflected in the summary based on the details provided in the article.
