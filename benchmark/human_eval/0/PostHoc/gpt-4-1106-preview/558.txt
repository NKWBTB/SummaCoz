Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The summary states that "a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly." However, the article does not confirm that the proposal has been approved. Instead, it indicates that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval. This means that the proposal is planned to be presented to the assembly, but it has not yet been approved.

Here are the steps that show the inconsistency:

1. The article states that Justice Minister Claire Sugden "confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval." This indicates a future action, not something that has already occurred.

2. The article mentions that the move will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, where plans for automatic pardons were announced, but it does not say that Northern Ireland has already implemented these plans.

3. The article specifies that the motion in the assembly is expected to contain the same provisions for pardons both posthumously and for living gay and bisexual men, but again, it does not state that this motion has been approved.

4. The minister is quoted as saying that she has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion, which is a step before approval, not the approval itself.

5. The article concludes by saying, "The motion will now go forward for consideration by the assembly." This clearly indicates that the motion is yet to be considered and therefore has not been approved.

In summary, the article discusses the intention to present a motion for pardoning gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, but it does not confirm that such a proposal has already been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly. The summary incorrectly suggests that the approval has taken place.
