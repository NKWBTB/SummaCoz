Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Amir Khan had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather in a $300 million mega-fight.
2. However, the article states that Khan had hoped to fight Adrien Broner, not Mayweather.
3. The article states but the pound-for-pound king(Mayweather) will instead meet Manny Pacquaio in a $300million mega-fight on May 2.
4. As the summary use the wrong information that is not included in article, it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
The inconsistency in the summary lies in the misrepresentation of the boxer Amir Khan's hopes. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The article states that Amir Khan had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather, but it does not specify the financial details of the potential fight.

2. The article mentions a "$300million mega-fight," but this is in reference to the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, not a fight between Mayweather and Khan.

3. The summary incorrectly combines these two separate pieces of information, suggesting that Khan had hoped to fight Mayweather in a "$300million mega-fight." This is not supported by the article, which clearly distinguishes between the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight and any potential fight involving Khan.

4. The article does not provide any information about the potential earnings or financial details of a fight between Khan and Mayweather, so the inclusion of the "$300million" figure in relation to Khan's hopes is inaccurate.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes the financial details of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight to a hypothetical fight between Mayweather and Khan.
