Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
1. The summary begins by stating that the catfish is named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, which is consistent with the article.

2. The summary correctly mentions that the fish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil, which is also consistent with the article.

3. The summary refers to "the resemblance to the first of the original Star Wars films." This is a vague statement, but it seems to imply that the catfish resembles something from the first Star Wars film. The article clarifies that the catfish was named after the character Greedo from Star Wars because of its physical resemblance to the character, so this part of the summary is consistent but could be more specific.

4. The summary states that "the new species of catfish Peckoltia greedoi has large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty." This is consistent with the article, which describes the catfish as having large eyes and a sucker mouth, and notes the resemblance to Greedo, who is indeed a bounty hunter in Star Wars.

5. The inconsistency arises with the last part of the summary: "han solo - an extinct species found in southern china." The article does mention "Han solo," but it refers to an extinct species of trilobite, not a catfish, and it is named after the Star Wars character Han Solo, not the catfish Peckoltia greedoi. The summary incorrectly suggests that the catfish is related to or named after Han Solo, which is not the case. The trilobite named Han solo is a separate species and is not the focus of the article, which is about the catfish named after Greedo.
