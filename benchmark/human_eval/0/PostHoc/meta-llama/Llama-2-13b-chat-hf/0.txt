Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Radio Rentals' income last year was made up of Centrelink payments, but the article states that only half of Radio Rentals' income came from Centrelink payments, specifically $90 million out of $197 million.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that "those who receive Centrelink payments made up Radio Rental's income last year."
2. However, the article states that "Nearly half of the Radio Rentals customers have been found to be on welfare payments, and they are not just renting household necessities." This implies that not all of Radio Rentals' income comes from Centrelink payments.
3. The article also states that "Of the $197 million of revenue they made, $90 million came from the bill-managing Centrelink service, Centrepay." This further supports the idea that not all of Radio Rentals' income comes from Centrelink payments.
4. Additionally, the article mentions that $45 million of the $90 million in expenditure was used for entertainment items such as flat screen TVs, which suggests that the income from Centrelink payments was not solely used for essential items.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions Centrelink payments as a source of income for Radio Rentals, while the article provides more information about the company's income and expenditure.

Overall, the summary is an oversimplification of the article's content and does not accurately reflect the full range of information provided.
