Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that the home was open for inspection "just a day after his sudden passing." This is not consistent with the fact that Malcolm Fraser passed away on Friday morning, as stated in the article.
2. The summary claims that the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing, which is not accurate. The article states that the home was built three years after the Frasers married, and it was last sold 20 years ago.
3. The summary does not provide any information about the property's location, size, or features, which are all mentioned in the article.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the property is located minutes away from the Parliamentary triangle, which is a significant aspect of the property's location.
5. The summary does not mention the name of the real estate agent or the fact that the property has been on the market since October last year, which are both mentioned in the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccurate information and leaves out important details.
