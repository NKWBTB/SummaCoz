Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party controlled up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists."
2. The summary states that "Sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections."
3. However, the article does not mention any electoral alliance of Sarkozy's. Instead, it mentions that the UMP party controlled up to 70 departments, which suggests that the party won the elections on its own, without any electoral alliance.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as there is no mention of an electoral alliance in the article.

Overall, the summary is not accurate because it implies that Sarkozy's electoral alliance won the departmental elections, when in fact the UMP party won the elections on its own.
