Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the London Film Festival, its director and a record of people's attendance.
2. However, there is no mention of the London Film Festival in the article.
3. The article is about a film called "Turning Points" and its director, Chris Tally Evans, who is from Rhayader, Powys. The article discusses the film's premiere at the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff and its inclusion in the London 2012 Festival, a nationwide arts event.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Based on the provided article and summary, it is clear that the summary is not consistent with the article. Here's why:

1. Attendance figure: The summary mentions "a record 25,000 people" attending the London film festival, but the article does not mention any attendance figure.
2. Festival date: The summary states that the festival took place in "September," but the article does not provide a specific date for the festival.
3. Director's quote: The summary attributes a quote to the festival's director, but the article does not include any quote from the director.

Therefore, it is clear that the summary is not based on the content of the article. It appears to be a standalone statement that is not related to the article.
