Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the resemblance to the first of the original star wars films, but it is not a whole sentence which has grammar error, in the article the fact is Professor Jonathan Armbruster, a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum, said his colleagues Chris Hamilton noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by Han Solo in the first of the original Star Wars films.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that the catfish is named by biologists at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, but the article states that the catfish was discovered in the Gurupi River in north central Brazil, and the name was given after the Star Wars character Greedo.
2. The summary mentions Han Solo as an extinct species found in southern China, but the article does not mention Han Solo at all.
3. The summary states that the new species of catfish has large eyes and a sucker mouth, but the article does not mention this. Instead, the article describes the catfish as having bug-eyes, bristles on its cheeks, and a large sucker mouth.
4. The summary does not mention the resemblance of the catfish to the Star Wars character Greedo, which is a key aspect of the article.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article, and contains several inaccuracies and omissions.
