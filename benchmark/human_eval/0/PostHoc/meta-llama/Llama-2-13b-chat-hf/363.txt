Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the deal, saying it does not roll back Iran's nuclear program and that Iran cannot be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal.
2. The article also states that Netanyahu said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with President Obama.
3. However, the summary states that "it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran."
4. This is inconsistent with the article, as the article clearly states that Netanyahu opposes the deal and does not think it is a good option for Iran.
5. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as it does not accurately reflect Netanyahu's position on the deal.

Overall, the summary is not a good representation of the article's content, as it does not accurately reflect Netanyahu's opposition to the deal and the reasons behind it.
