Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the five-year-old child is called mai zizhuo and he has been shanghai-born yao ming , who played for nba 's houston rockets from 2002 to 2011. But in the article it mentions mai zizhuo and yao ming are not the same person. Thus the summary is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the five-year-old child, Mai Zizhuo, has been shooting hoops since he was two and a half years old, according to the People's Daily Online.
2. However, the article does not mention Mai Zizhuo's age or when he started playing basketball. The article only mentions that he is a five-year-old boy who has been practicing basketball since he was two and a half years old.
3. The summary also states that Mai Zizhuo is Shanghai-born Yao Ming, who played for the NBA's Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011. This is not accurate, as Yao Ming is a professional basketball player who played in the NBA, but he is not a five-year-old child.
4. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it includes inaccurate information about Mai Zizhuo's age and identity. The article does not provide enough information to support the claims made in the summary.
