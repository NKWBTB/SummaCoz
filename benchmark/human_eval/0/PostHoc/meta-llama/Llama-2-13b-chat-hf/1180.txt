Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that John Fett, a Star Wars actor, is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
2. However, the article does not mention anything about John Fett being an actor or being overwhelmed by the latest collection.
3. The article actually talks about Mick Fett, a Star Wars collector, and his extensive collection of Star Wars memorabilia.
4. The summary is not consistent with the article because it mentions John Fett, who is not mentioned in the article, and it also mentions The Force Awakens, which is not the focus of the article.
5. Therefore, the summary is not an accurate representation of the article.

Overall, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a new character (John Fett) and a new topic (The Force Awakens) that are not present in the article.
