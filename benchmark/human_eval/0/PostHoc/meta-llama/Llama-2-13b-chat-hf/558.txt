Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that a proposal to pardon gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly.
2. However, the article mentions that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval, but it does not explicitly state that the proposal has been approved yet.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting the approval as a finalized action, whereas the article indicates that it is still in the process of being considered and approved by the assembly.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The article states that "a motion will go before the assembly for approval." This implies that the assembly has not yet approved the proposal, as the motion has only just been put forward.
2. The article also states that "the move will bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, where plans for automatic pardons were announced last month." This suggests that the proposal is not yet approved, as the article is discussing plans that have not yet been implemented.
3. The summary states that "a proposal to pardon gay and bisexexual men convicted of sexual offences in Northern Ireland has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly." This is not consistent with the article, as the article does not state that the proposal has been approved.
4. The article does state that the motion will contain the same provisions as the proposed law in England and Wales, and that the minister has secured executive agreement to ask the assembly to pass a legislative consent motion. However, this does not mean that the proposal has been approved.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, as the article does not state that the proposal has been approved. The article only discusses plans that have been put forward and are awaiting approval by the assembly.
