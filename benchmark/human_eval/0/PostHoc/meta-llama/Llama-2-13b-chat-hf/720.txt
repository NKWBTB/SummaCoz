Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Natalia Moon, aged 23, has become a TV sensation in the Philippines and moved there in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in the Philippines in 2012.
2. However, the article provides a more accurate account. Natalia Moon, aged 23, is indeed a TV sensation in the Philippines. She moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress in Australia, not the Philippines. The summary incorrectly states that she struggled to find work in the Philippines, which is not what the article conveys.
3. The inconsistency is due to the summary mistakenly suggesting that Natalia Moon struggled to find work in the Philippines in 2012, which is not what the article states.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Age: The summary states that Natalia Moon is 23 years old, but the article states that she is 23 years old and was born as Natalie Stewart.
2. Reason for moving to the Philippines: The summary states that Natalia moved to the Philippines in 2012 after struggling to find work as an actress, but the article states that she moved to the Philippines in 2012 to pursue her dream of becoming a star and learned the local language, Tagalog, to improve her chances.
3. Career: The summary only mentions that Natalia is a TV sensation, but the article states that she landed a major role in the sitcom "Ismol Family" in 2014 and has also been featured in magazine spreads in the Philippines.
4. Audition for Asia's Got Talent: The summary states that Natalia unsuccessfully auditioned for Asia's Got Talent, but the article states that she auditioned for the show this year, but did not make it.

Overall, the summary does not accurately reflect the information in the article. It is important to ensure that all information in a summary is supported by the original text to maintain accuracy and consistency.
