Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain, a 24-year-old man, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the execution was stayed.

2. The article states that Shafqat Hussain, who was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. The article also mentions that Hussain's family claims he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and that he did not receive a fair trial.

3. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the stay of execution.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  Sure! Here's why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. Inconsistent age: The summary states that Shafqat Hussain is 24 years old, while the article states that he was 14 years old when he was convicted of manslaughter.
2. Incorrect execution date: The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours and that a review of his case will be conducted during that time.
3. Lack of information about the stay of execution: The summary does not mention the stay of execution or the fact that the government has ordered a review of Shafqat Hussain's case.

Overall, the summary does not provide an accurate summary of the article. It does not include key information about Shafqat Hussain's age, the reason for the stay of execution, and the fact that his case will be reviewed.
