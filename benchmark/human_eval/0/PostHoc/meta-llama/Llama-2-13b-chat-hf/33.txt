Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The provided summary is not consistent with the article because it only mentions that the chickens live together in huge sheds for 35 days before being gassed, while the article provides more information about the conditions of the chickens on the farm. Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. The summary states that the chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. This is not entirely accurate, as the article provides more information about the chickens' living conditions on the farm.
2. The article mentions that the chickens are kept in huge sheds with few windows, and that they live amid their own excrement. This is not mentioned in the summary.
3. The article also states that the chickens have a short life, but the farmer claims that they have a good life. This contrast is not present in the summary.
4. The summary does not mention the fact that the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces, and sent to warehouses in large trays. This is a significant aspect of the article that highlights the chickens' fate.
5. The summary does not mention the animal rights campaigners' claims that the lives of the KFC chickens are oppressive, which is a key point in the article.

Overall, the summary does not provide a complete and accurate representation of the article's content. It only focuses on one aspect of the chickens' living conditions and ignores other important details that are provided in the article.
