Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote onÂ Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The quote mentioned in the summary is not from a Russian, but from a Brazilian student, Humberto Moura Fonseca.
2. The quote is not about dying from vodka, but about dying from boredom. The quote is: "It is better to die from vodka than from boredom."
3. The article does not mention anything about the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, who is supposedly the author of the quote.
4. The summary does not mention the tragic event that occurred, which is the main focus of the article.
5. The summary does not provide any context or supporting information for the quote, leaving the reader without any understanding of its significance or relevance to the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains inaccurate information, lacks context, and does not accurately represent the content of the article.
