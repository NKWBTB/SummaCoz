Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. Here's why:

1. The article clearly states that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Iran nuclear deal, saying it's a "bad deal" and that there are better options than this deal or war.
2. The article also mentions that Democrats and Republicans are sparring over the framework announced last week to lift Western sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges, limiting its highly enriched uranium, and increasing inspections.
3. The article quotes Netanyahu as saying that the deal does not roll back Iran's nuclear program, keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place, and allows thousands of centrifuges to keep spinning, enriching uranium.
4. The article also mentions that Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz defended the deal, saying it would extend from two months to one year the "breakout" time period -- the length of time it would take Iran to build a nuclear bomb.
5. The summary, however, states that it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran, which is not supported by the content of the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article clearly presents opposing views on the Iran nuclear deal, but the summary does not accurately summarize those views.
