Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it attributes a quote to Ray Parlour that does not appear in the article. The quote mentioned in the summary is:

"He's a very good player, he's a very technically gifted player and he's got a great attitude. He's got a great attitude, a great work ethic, he's a very good player. I think he's got a great future."

However, upon reviewing the article, it does not contain this quote from Ray Parlour. The article does mention a quote from Parlour, but it is different from the one mentioned in the summary. The actual quote from Parlour in the article is:

"I think he’s the future of the club. I think if he stays fit, he’s a quality player, there’s no doubt about that. The way he goes past players, the way he links up with people, I definitely think he’s got a big role to play."

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes a quote to Ray Parlour that does not appear in the article.
