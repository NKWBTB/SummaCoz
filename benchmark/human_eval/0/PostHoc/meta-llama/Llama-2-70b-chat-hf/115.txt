Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions jim hamilton is a little detached from the reality of something special.
2. The original sentence in article is After four straight Six Nations defeats, it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but Jim Hamilton, that most rugged of lock forwards, maintains this is a team on the verge of something special.
3. The summary simply concatenate some words from the original sentence and discard the rest of words which express different meaning with article, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately reflect the main idea of the article. The article presents Jim Hamilton's optimistic view of the Scottish rugby team's future, despite their current losing streak, and highlights his belief in the team's potential for success under coach Vern Cotter.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The summary states that Jim Hamilton is "a little detached from the reality" of something special, implying that he is not in touch with the team's actual situation.
2. However, the article portrays Hamilton as a positive and optimistic influence on the team, who genuinely believes in their potential for success.
3. The article quotes Hamilton as saying, "I genuinely, genuinely believe in what I am doing and what he is doing otherwise I would not be working as hard as I am to be here and trying to get into the Scotland team."
4. This quote shows that Hamilton is not detached from reality, but rather, he is committed to the team's success and has faith in Cotter's ability to lead them to victory.
5. The article also highlights Hamilton's belief in the team's young talent, such as Jonny Gray and Adam Ashe, and his confidence in their ability to execute Cotter's game plan.
6. Therefore, the summary's statement that Hamilton is "a little detached from the reality" of something special is not supported by the article's content.

In conclusion, the summary does not accurately reflect the main idea of the article, which is that Jim Hamilton has faith in the Scottish rugby team's potential for success under Vern Cotter, despite their current losing streak.
