Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions John Fett, but the article does not mention any person with that name. The article only mentions "Mick Fett," who is the one with the extensive Star Wars collection.
2. The summary states that Fett is overwhelmed by the latest Star Wars collection: the force awakens. Howevewr, the article does not mention a Star Wars collection named "the force awakens".
3. The summary mentions that Fett says he is "overwhelmed" by the latest collection, but the article does not quote him as saying that.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The summary states that John Fett, a Star Wars actor, is overwhelmed by the latest collection of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but the article does not mention anything about John Fett or his feelings towards the latest collection.
2. The article actually focuses on a man named Mick Fett, who is a Star Wars fan and collector, and not an actor.
3. The summary does not accurately represent the content of the article, which is about Mick Fett's extensive Star Wars collection and his alter ego, Aussie Vader.
4. The summary does not include any information about Mick Fett's collection, his love for Star Wars, or his alter ego, Aussie Vader, which are the main points of the article.
5. The summary does not provide any specific examples or details from the article to support its claims, which suggests that it is not based on the content of the article.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and does not accurately represent the information provided in the article.
