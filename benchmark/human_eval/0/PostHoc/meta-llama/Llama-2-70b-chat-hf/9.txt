Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the home was built for inspection just a day after his sudden passing.
2. But the fact in article is The home which was built for former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie has been opened for inspection just a day after his sudden passing. 
3. The summary simply concatenate two parts of the sentence from the article and express different meanings. Thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it states that the home was built for inspection just a day after Malcolm Fraser's sudden passing, which is not supported by the information in the article. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the summary is inconsistent with the article:

1. The article states that the home, known as JM Fraser House, was built for Malcolm Fraser and his wife Tamie.
2. The article does not mention anything about the home being built for inspection.
3. The summary implies that the home was built specifically for the purpose of inspection, which is not supported by the article.
4. The article mentions that the home was open for inspection a day after Malcolm Fraser's passing, but it does not suggest that the home was built for that purpose.
5. The article states that the home has been on the market since October last year, which contradicts the summary's implication that the home was built for inspection just a day after Fraser's passing.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a new idea that the home was built for inspection, which is not supported by the information in the article.
