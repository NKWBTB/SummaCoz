Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain, a 24-year-old man, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the execution was stayed.

2. The article states that Shafqat Hussain, who was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. The article also mentions that Hussain's family claims he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and that he did not receive a fair trial.

3. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the stay of execution.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not supported by the article. Specifically, the summary states that Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article does not mention any scheduled execution date for Hussain. In fact, the article states that Hussain's execution was stayed just hours before he was due to be hanged, and that his case would be reviewed for another 72 hours. Therefore, the summary's statement about Hussain being scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday is not consistent with the information provided in the article.
