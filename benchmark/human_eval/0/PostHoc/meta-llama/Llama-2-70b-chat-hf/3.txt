Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions sarkozy's electoral alliance has won departmental elections. But in the article the fact is referring to the UMP's electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), Mr Sarkozy said: 'Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has our political family won so many departments. So it should be UMP's electoral alliance in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because:

1. The article states that Nicolas Sarkozy's opposition UMP party won the departmental elections, not Sarkozy's electoral alliance. The article mentions that the UMP had an electoral alliance with the centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), but it does not suggest that the alliance itself won the elections.
2. The article highlights the failure of the ruling Socialists, but it does not mention anything about Sarkozy's electoral alliance winning the departmental elections. The focus of the article is on the UMP's victory and the Socialists' defeat, rather than on the performance of Sarkozy's electoral alliance.
3. The summary implies that Sarkozy's electoral alliance was the key factor in the UMP's victory, but the article does not support this claim. The article mentions that the UMP won up to 70 departments, compared to 37 for the Socialists, but it does not provide any information about the performance of Sarkozy's electoral alliance specifically.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the information provided in the article and implies a connection between Sarkozy's electoral alliance and the UMP's victory that is not supported by the text.
