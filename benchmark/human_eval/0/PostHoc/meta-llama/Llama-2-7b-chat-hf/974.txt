Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that Parlour's comments are solely focused on Wilshere's fitness, but the article actually covers a range of topics, including Wilshere's return from injury, his quality as a player, and the fact that he has been out of action for five months.
2. The summary does not discuss Mesut Ozil's new apple watch purchase.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Inconsistent language: The summary uses the phrase "Parlour says" to attribute the quotes to Ray Parlour, while the article uses "said Parlour" to attribute the quotes to him.
2. Missing context: The summary does not provide any context for Parlour's quotes, while the article provides background information on Wilshere's injury history and Parlour's comments on his potential.
3. Incorrect information: The summary states that Wilshere's fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his potential, while the article quotes Parlour as saying that Wilshere's fitness record is the "big burning question" holding him back.
4. Omitted details: The summary does not mention any specific examples of Wilshere's technical ability or work ethic, while the article provides details on these aspects of his game.
5. Inconsistent tone: The summary has a more serious tone than the article, which has a more neutral tone throughout.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in terms of language, context, information, details, and tone.
