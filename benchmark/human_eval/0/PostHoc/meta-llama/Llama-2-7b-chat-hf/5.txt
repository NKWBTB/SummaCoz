Reference Reasoning:

2. The fact in article is Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head.
3. The summary only use part of information from the original sentence which is incomplete, thus it is inconsistent with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Inconsistent language: The summary uses the phrase "Miliband's ear" to refer to the two women in question, while the article uses "Miliband's inner circle" to describe the group of people involved in the feud.
2. Missing information: The summary does not provide any information about the nature of the tension between Lucy Powell and Rosie Winterton, while the article provides details about the specific issue that caused the dispute, such as Powell's desire to attend the Brit Awards pre-party and Winterton's insistence that she prioritize the vote in Parliament.
3. Incorrect attribution: The summary attributes the quote "She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott" to Rosie Winterton, while the article actually attributes this quote to a source within the Labour Party.
4. Inconsistent tone: The summary has a more sensational tone than the article, using phrases like "dust-up" and "hobnobbing with Madonna" to describe the dispute, while the article presents a more neutral tone and focuses on providing factual information about the situation.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in terms of language, information, attribution, and tone.
