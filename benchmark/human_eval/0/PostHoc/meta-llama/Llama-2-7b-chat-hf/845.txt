Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary implies that a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen. The shooter had taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C., which ended when ramming the front gates.
2. However, the article states that the shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once. The guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car and went to investigate, costing him his life.
3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests the shooter's chase into D.C. ended by ramming the front gates, while the article states that the shooting occurred after the shooter tried to ram the gates. The sequence of events is misrepresented in the summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The summary states that the guard at the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters was shot in the abdomen, while the article does not mention the location of the guard's injury.
2. The summary claims that the shooter took "some three dozen police officers" on a wild chase back into D.C., while the article does not provide any information about the number of police officers involved in the chase or their destination.
3. The summary states that the shooter tried to ram the front gates before firing at the guard, while the article does not mention anything about the shooter attempting to ram the gates.
4. The summary states that the guard went to investigate the couple fighting in a car, which is not mentioned in the article.
5. The summary claims that the gunman's trail of violence continued back into D.C., while the article only mentions one shooting incident that occurred in the Southeast quadrant of the city.
6. The summary states that two police officers were wounded in the showdown, while the article only mentions that one police officer was injured.

Therefore, the summary contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies compared to the article.
