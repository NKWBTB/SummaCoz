Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions ** k'' can also be included in messages,but in the article it is  'Terrorist' and 'd**k' can also be included in messages. Here '** k' and 'd**k' represent different words, so the summary is inconsistent with the article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. The summary states that "jihad, Buddha and Allah are accepted," while the article states that "jihad, Buddha and Allah are included in the list of banned words." This is a direct contradiction, as the article clearly states that these words are not allowed.
2. The summary implies that "d**k" is a banned word, while the article does not mention it as a banned word. In fact, the article states that "terrorist" and "d**k" can be included in messages, which is not consistent with the summary's statement.
3. The summary states that "Christ and Jesus Christ join other banned words including 'f***' and 'gay' - but some terms including jihad, Buddha and Allah are accepted," while the article does not mention "f***" and "gay" as banned words. The article only mentions "Christ" and "Jesus Christ" as banned words, along with "jihad," "Buddha," and "Allah."
4. The summary implies that the policy has been changed, stating that "Despite the supermarket giant being made aware of the issue yesterday, M&S has still not changed the facility." However, the article does not mention any change in policy, and the spokesperson for Marks & Spencer states that the facility is still in place.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article, and it appears to be a mistake or misinterpretation of the information provided in the article.
