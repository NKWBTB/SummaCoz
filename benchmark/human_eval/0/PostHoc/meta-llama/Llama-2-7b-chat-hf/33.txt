Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed, but in the article the correponding sentence is The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed. The word 'chickens' in the article is missed in the summary which is a quite important information. Missing the word in the summary would express differet meanings which is not consisten with article.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Length of time the chickens live: The article states that the chickens live for 35 days, while the summary states "the thousands live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed." This discrepancy suggests that the summary may have misread or misinterpreted the information in the article.
2. Number of chickens: The article states that about 34,000 chickens are penned into sheds, while the summary states "thousands of chickens." This discrepancy could be due to a mistake in the summary's wording or a misunderstanding of the information in the article.
3. Treatment of chickens: The article highlights the conditions in which the chickens are kept and the fact that they are gassed when they reach the required weight, while the summary does not mention anything about the treatment of the chickens. This suggests that the summary may have missed or downplayed the important information in the article.
4. Quality of life: The article quotes a farmer as saying that the chickens have a "very good life," while the summary does not include this quote or any other information about the quality of life of the chickens. This suggests that the summary may have missed or misinterpreted the information in the article about the quality of life of the chickens.

Overall, the summary does not accurately convey the information in the article and may have misled readers by omitting or distorting important details.
