Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that it's not clear whether the deal will be used in Iran, while the article states that the deal has been reached and the details have been announced.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a statement that is not supported by the information provided in the article. Specifically, the summary states "it's not clear whether the deal will not be used in Iran," but the article does not provide any information that suggests this is a possibility.

Here are the reasons why the summary is not consistent with the article:

1. The article does not mention anything about the deal not being used in Iran. In fact, the article states that the deal would extend the "breakout" time period for Iran to build a nuclear bomb from two months to one year, which suggests that the deal is intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
2. The article quotes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying that Iran cannot be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, but it does not provide any information that suggests Iran has any intention of using the deal to develop nuclear weapons.
3. The article does provide information about the negotiators working on the deal being "on the cusp of something that can be workable," which suggests that the deal has the potential to be effective in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article because it makes a statement that is not supported by the information provided in the article.
