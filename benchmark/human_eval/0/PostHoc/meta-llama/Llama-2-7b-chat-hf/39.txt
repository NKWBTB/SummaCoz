Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary mentions the russian says it is better to die from vodka than from boredom, but the fact in article is a quote onÂ Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page says: 'It is better to die from vodka than from boredom'. The summary should clearly point out it is Humberto Moura Fonseca says the content in summary.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Inconsistent quote: The summary includes a quote from Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page, which reads, "It is better to die from vodka than from boredom." However, this quote is not present in the article.
2. Missing context: The article does not mention anything about Humberto Moura Fonseca's Facebook page or any quote he may have had. The article only provides information about the drinking competition that led to his death.
3. Incorrect cause of death: The summary states that Humberto Moura Fonseca died from vodka, whereas the article states that he died from alcohol poisoning after drinking 25 shots in 60 seconds.
4. Irrelevant information: The summary includes information about the organizers of the drinking competition being arrested, which is not relevant to Humberto Moura Fonseca's death.
5. Inconsistent tone: The summary has a more lighthearted and ironic tone than the article, which is a news report about a tragic event.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article and appears to be a misleading or inaccurate summary of the information provided in the article.
