Reference Reasoning:
1. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain, a 24-year-old man, was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the execution was stayed.

2. The article states that Shafqat Hussain, who was convicted of manslaughter at the age of 14, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. The article also mentions that Hussain's family claims he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and that he did not receive a fair trial.

3. The summary states that Shafqat Hussain was scheduled to be hanged on Wednesday, but the article states that the execution was stayed for 72 hours to review his case. This means that the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not mention the stay of execution.
Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.

Model Reasoning:
  The summary is not consistent with the article for the following reasons:

1. Age of the accused: The summary states that Shafqat Hussain is 24 years old, while the article states that he was 14 years old at the time of the incident.
2. Type of crime: The summary mentions that Hussain was scheduled to be hanged for manslaughter, while the article states that he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004.
3. Legal representation: The summary does not mention anything about Hussain's legal representation, while the article states that he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police.
4. Stay of execution: The summary does not mention anything about a stay of execution, while the article states that Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order and an investigation into Hussain's age.
5. Moratorium on death penalty: The summary does not mention anything about Pakistan lifting its moratorium on the death penalty, while the article states that Pakistan lifted the moratorium on all cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar.

Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article in terms of the age of the accused, the type of crime, legal representation, stay of execution, and the moratorium on the death penalty.
