Instead, it discusses the downing of a Russian Su-24 jet by Turkish F-16 fighters near the Turkish-Syrian border. The article specifies that the incident happened on November 24.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly places the incident in the Syrian capital, Ankara, and suggests it involved two Russian jets, while the article provides the correct details about the incident involving a Russian Su-24 jet and Turkish F-16 fighters near the border.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The summary states that \"a Russian jet has been shot dead by a Russian jet jet in the Syrian capital, Ankara.\" This statement contains several inaccuracies:\n   - A jet cannot be \"shot dead\" as this term applies to living beings. The correct term would be \"shot down.\"\n   - The article does not mention that a Russian jet was shot down by another Russian jet; it implies that the jet was shot down by Turkish F-16 fighters.\n   - Ankara is not the Syrian capital; it is the capital of Turkey. The article does not specify where exactly the jet was shot down, only that there is a dispute over whether it was in Turkish airspace or Syrian airspace.\n\n2. The article provides context for the downing of the jet, explaining that it was a Su-24 jet and that the incident has led to a crisis in relations between Russia and Turkey. The summary does not mention any of this context.\n\n3. The article mentions that the downing of the jet has resulted in sanctions imposed by Russia on Turkey and provides details on the consequences and political tensions. The summary does not include any information about the sanctions or the broader political implications.\n\n4. The article provides information about the crew of the downed jet, stating that both crew members ejected, one was killed by militants on the ground, and the other was rescued. It also mentions the death of a Russian marine during a rescue attempt and the destruction of a helicopter. None of these details are present in the summary.\n\n5. The article does not state that the incident occurred in Ankara or that a Russian jet shot down another Russian jet. The summary's claim is not supported by the article.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
