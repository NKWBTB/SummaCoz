{"document": "Mila Kunis is being sued by a Ukrainian wannabe singer who claims the Hollywood actress 'stole her pet chicken' as children. Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that\u00a025 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo \u00a0claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

Therefore, the name \"ms bateman\" is inconsistent with the article.\n\nStep 2: The summary states that Kristina Karo alleges she was a classmate of Ms. Kunis's pet chicken. The article, however, states that Kristina Karo alleges she was a classmate of Ms. Kunis herself, not her pet chicken. This is another inconsistency.\n\nStep 3: The summary repeats the phrase \"they were 'inseparable'\" which seems to be a duplication error. The article does mention that Karo and Kunis were 'inseparable' growing up, so this part is consistent, but the repetition in the summary is not present in the article.\n\nStep 4: The summary mentions that Kristina Karo was \"envious of her pet hen\" and repeats the word \"envious.\" The article actually states that it was Mila Kunis who was allegedly envious of Kristina Karo's pet hen, not the other way around. This is a misrepresentation of the information in the article.\n\nStep 5: The summary does not mention any of the other details provided in the article, such as the lawsuit, the claim of emotional distress, the therapy bills, or the specifics about the chicken named \"Doggie.\"\n\nBased on these steps, the summary contains multiple inaccuracies and omissions that make it inconsistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
