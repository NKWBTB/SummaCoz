The article discusses Ms. Evans, who is currently suspended from UKIP, and her desire to run for the leadership position that has been vacated by Nigel Farage.\n2. The article states that Ms. Evans is unable to run due to a six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute, a claim she dismisses.\n3. It is mentioned that Ms. Evans would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage.\n4. The leadership contest is indeed prompted by Mr. Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.\n5. The article quotes Ms. Evans expressing her desire to run and her frustration with the party's leadership preventing her from doing so.\n6. The article does not contain a direct quote from Nigel Farage stating that he will stand down as the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP); rather, it is a statement of fact that he has decided to stand down.\n\nFinal Assessment:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary incorrectly attributes a quote to Nigel Farage (\"ukip's nigel farage has said she will stand down as leader of the party's uk independence party\"), which is not present in the article. Additionally, the summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, which focuses on Ms. Evans' situation and her inability to run for the leadership position, rather than a statement from Farage about his own resignation."}
