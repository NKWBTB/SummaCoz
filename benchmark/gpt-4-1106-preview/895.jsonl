This is also consistent with the article, which identifies the child by the same name.\n\nStep 3: The summary includes a statement that Mai Zizhuo \"has been shanghai-born Yao Ming,\" which seems to be an error. The article mentions Yao Ming as a separate individual, describing him as \"the country's biggest basketball star so far,\" and notes that he played for the NBA's Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011. The article does not suggest that Mai Zizhuo is Yao Ming or has any direct connection to him, other than both being associated with basketball in China.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary contains an error in the second statement, which misrepresents the information provided in the article about Yao Ming. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
