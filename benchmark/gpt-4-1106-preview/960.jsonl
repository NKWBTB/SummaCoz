The summary states that Vanessa Santillan, 33, was found in a flat in Fulham, southwest London. The article confirms this information, stating her body was found in a \u00a3400,000 flat in Fulham.\n\n2. The summary mentions that she was a 33-year-old Mexican national and was found dead at the end of March. The article supports this by mentioning her age, nationality, and that she was killed at the end of March.\n\n3. The summary claims that she was found guilty of injuries to the head and neck. This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article states that she died as a result of injuries to the head and neck, not that she was found guilty of those injuries. The term \"found guilty\" is incorrect as it implies a legal judgment, which is not applicable to the victim.\n\n4. The summary correctly notes that the police are appealing to anyone who may have had contact with Miss Santillan in the hours before her death. The article also makes this appeal for information.\n\n5. The summary includes a statement that \"she has been told to return to a London police station for further questioning.\" This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article mentions that a 23-year-old man was arrested in connection with her death and has been bailed, with instructions to return to a London police station for further questioning. The summary incorrectly attributes this action to Vanessa Santillan, who is the victim and cannot be told to return for questioning.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article due to the incorrect statement about Vanessa Santillan being found guilty of injuries and the misattribution of the instruction to return to a police station for further questioning."}
