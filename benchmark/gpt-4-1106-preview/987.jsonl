The summary states that \"the Caribbean island team advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF for the 2018 tournament late Tuesday,\" which is consistent with the article's information that Curacao advanced after their match on Tuesday.\n\n2. The summary mentions that \"Curacao drew 2-2 in a match at Montserrat to win 4-3 on aggregate,\" which aligns with the article's details about the second-leg match result and the aggregate score.\n\n3. The summary incorrectly states that \"Louis van Gaal scored in the 87th minute five minutes after a substitute.\" The article actually says that \"former Holland Under 21 international Charlton Vicento scored in the 87th minute, five minutes after coming on as a substitute.\" Louis van Gaal is mentioned in the article, but as a coach that Patrick Kluivert worked with, not as a player who scored a goal.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes the goal to Louis van Gaal instead of Charlton Vicento.\n\nAnswer: No"}
