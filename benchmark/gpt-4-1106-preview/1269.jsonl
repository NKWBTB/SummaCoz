rather than government activity.\nMost individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.\nFacebook's privacy policy, for example, states: \" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities\".\nAre we all being watched?\nThe ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.\n\"You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,\" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.\nSpeaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that \"law abiding citizens\" in Britain would \"never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up\".\nDoes it make a difference which country you live in?\nUser data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves -

It also mentions the Prism program, which allegedly provided \"backdoor\" access to the servers of major technology companies.\n\nStep 3: Compare the article's content with the summary statement.\nThe summary states that the NSA has released details of its data collection practices. However, the article does not support this statement. Instead, it attributes the release of information to Edward Snowden's leaks, not to an official release by the NSA.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly suggests that the NSA voluntarily released details of its data collection practices, whereas the article clearly states that the information was leaked by Edward Snowden.\n\nAnswer: No"}
