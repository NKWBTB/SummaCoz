The article mentions that two cars were damaged, not just one car as stated in the summary.\n2. The incident occurred on Friday night, but the summary incorrectly states it happened on New Year's Day.\n3. The article specifies the location as the Nursery Drive and Parkhead area of Newry, which is in County Down, so the location in the summary is consistent with the article.\n4. The article quotes Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin as being \"appalled by mindless attacks on PSNI officers and the Newry community,\" which is similar to the sentiment expressed in the summary, although the summary refers to a \"police community support officer\" and not the Assistant Chief Constable.\n5. The article does not specify that the attack was directly on a police community support officer, but rather mentions attacks on PSNI officers in general.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies regarding the number of cars attacked, the date of the incident, and the specific role of the person quoted.\n\nAnswer: No"}
