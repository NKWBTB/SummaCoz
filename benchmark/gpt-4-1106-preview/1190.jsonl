The article discusses Robert Fidler, who built a house in Salfords, Surrey, and not a mock-Tudor castle. The style of the house is not specified in the article.\n\n2. The article states that the house was built in 2000 and was hidden behind hay bales. There is no mention of the duration for which Robert Fidler has been away from his home.\n\n3. The article mentions that Robert Fidler had been ordered to tear down his home and that he had made significant progress in doing so. It does not state that he is to return to his home.\n\n4. The article indicates that Fidler hopes to rebuild his home on another site with full planning permission, which implies that he is not returning to the original house but rather planning to rebuild elsewhere.\n\n5. The article does not provide any information about the time Fidler has spent away from the home or his intentions to return to the same location.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly describes the house as a mock-Tudor castle, suggests that Fidler is returning to his home, and mentions a specific duration of four years which is not supported by the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
