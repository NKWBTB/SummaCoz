The article mentions that Shanghai, presumably Shanghai Shenhua given the context of signing an Argentine forward, have signed a player from Boca Juniors. The summary incorrectly states \"Shanghai SIPG,\" which is a different club.\n\n2. The article specifies that the player signed is an Argentine forward, who is 32 years old. The summary does not mention any player, let alone an Argentine forward.\n\n3. The article talks about a specific transfer involving Carlos Tevez, with financial details of the deal provided (\u00a340m and a salary of over \u00a3310,000 a week). The summary does not mention any details of the transfer or the player involved.\n\n4. The article provides additional context about Tevez's career, including his time in the Premier League, Champions League victory, and tenure at Juventus. None of this information is present in the summary.\n\n5. The article also mentions another transfer involving Chelsea and Shanghai SIPG for Brazilian midfielder Oscar. The summary does not mention this transfer.\n\n6. The summary contains a nonsensical statement about agreeing to sign \"up to 1,000 Chinese Super League clubs,\" which is not supported by the article and does not make sense in the context of football transfers.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article. It contains incorrect information (wrong club name), omits key details about the player and the transfer, and includes a statement that is not supported by the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
