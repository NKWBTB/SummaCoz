The article discusses the UK Parliament's energy and climate change select committee and Scottish affairs select committee, not a Holyrood committee. Holyrood refers to the Scottish Parliament, which is different from the UK Parliament.\n\n2. The article states that the SNP (Scottish National Party), which won 56 of the 59 Westminster constituencies, will take control of these select committees at the UK Parliament level due to being the third largest party.\n\n3. The article mentions that the SNP will be chairing these committees, which is significant for Scotland, but it does not mention setting up a new committee specifically for giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament.\n\n4. The article references the Scotland Bill on more powers for Scotland, but this is not the same as setting up a committee. The Scotland Bill is a piece of legislation, not a committee.\n\n5. The summary's mention of a \"holyrood committee\" is not supported by the article, which is focused on the UK Parliament's select committees.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not mention the establishment of a Holyrood committee, nor does it discuss a committee being set up to give MPs more powers to the Scottish Parliament. Instead, it talks about the SNP taking control of certain UK Parliament select committees."}
