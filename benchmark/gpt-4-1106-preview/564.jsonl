However, the article provides the accurate information that Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell, was approached to return to EastEnders for Dame Barbara Windsor's final episodes as Peggy Mitchell.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary's incorrect use of gender pronouns and the inaccurate representation of Dame Barbara Windsor's involvement in the EastEnders storyline, while the article correctly presents the facts of Ross Kemp's return and Barbara Windsor's character's storyline.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell on EastEnders, and his return to the show for Barbara Windsor's final episodes. The summary, however, incorrectly refers to Dame Barbara Windsor as an actor using the pronoun \"he,\" which is inconsistent with the article.\n\n2. The article mentions that Kemp was approached about returning to EastEnders for Barbara Windsor's final episodes and that he could not turn it down. The summary seems to attempt to convey this but does so in a confusing manner, referring to Barbara Windsor as \"the last time legend of EastEnders,\" which is not a phrase used in the article.\n\n3. The article provides context for Kemp's return, stating that it is to reunite the Mitchell brothers as their mother's character, played by Barbara Windsor, is being killed off. The summary does not mention any of this context.\n\n4. The article includes quotes from Ross Kemp and the EastEnders executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, which provide insight into the significance of the storyline and the characters involved. The summary does not capture any of these details.\n\n5. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It fails to mention Ross Kemp's return to the show, the reason for his return, or the storyline involving Peggy Mitchell's character being killed off.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
