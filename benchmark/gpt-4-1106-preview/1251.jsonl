The article discusses concerns and criticisms about the project, including environmental damage, potential escalating costs, and the involvement of foreign governments.\n\n5. The UK government launched a further review of the project after EDF's board voted to approve it, indicating hesitation or a need for further consideration, not a definitive scrapping.\n\n6. The article includes opinions from various stakeholders urging the government to make a decision soon due to concerns about energy supply and costs.\n\n7. The article does not state that the government has decided to scrap the Hinkley Point nuclear plant; it only indicates that there is a delay and further review.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that EDF is \"very concerned\" about the government's decision to scrap the Hinkley Point nuclear plant.
