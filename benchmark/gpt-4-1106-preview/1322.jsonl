The article mentions that British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warned about the potential dangers of AI, stating that it could \"re-design itself at an ever increasing rate\", which could surpass human intelligence.\n\n2. The summary, however, states that \"one of the world's biggest physicists has warned that artificial intelligence could be used in humans.\" This statement is vague and does not accurately reflect the specific concern expressed by Hawking as reported in the article. The article talks about AI surpassing human intelligence, not about AI being used in humans.\n\n3. The article does not specify any physicist as \"one of the world's biggest physicists,\" so this characterization in the summary is subjective and not directly supported by the article.\n\n4. The summary does not mention any of the other details provided in the article, such as the backers of the venture (including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel), the mission of OpenAI, or the differing opinions on the threat level posed by AI.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the summary is not consistent with the article because it does not accurately represent the concerns about AI expressed in the article, and it omits significant details.\n\nAnswer: No"}
