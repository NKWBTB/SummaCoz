The article mentions that Hungary's Foreign Minister, Mr. Szijjarto, has stated that Hungary would not backtrack on any of the three issues (asylum seekers, NGOs, higher education law) and that these laws are a matter of national competence.\n\n3. The article refers to the EU potentially taking action against Hungary, which could include stripping Hungary of its EU voting rights. However, it is noted that Poland would veto any such move.\n\n4. The article specifically talks about the Higher Education Law that could lead to the closure of the Central European University, not about a new European law on human rights.\n\n5. The article does not mention any statement by Prime Minister Viktor Orban regarding a new European law on human rights or that he has warned that such a law should be lifted.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces a claim about a new European law on human rights and a warning from Viktor Orban that is not supported by any information in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
