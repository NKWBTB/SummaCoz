The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary states that Greece's economy minister, Alexis Tsipras, is struggling to agree a loan deal with Greece.

The article discusses the situation in Greece where the Syriza government, led by Alexis Tsipras, is poised to agree and implement austerity and liberalization measures as mandated by creditors. This aligns with the summary's mention of Alexis Tsipras and his colleagues working on a loan deal.\n\n2. The article mentions that this is in the context of a third bailout for Greece, which involves obtaining \u20ac86bn of new credit from the eurozone and possibly the IMF. This is consistent with the summary's reference to a loan deal.\n\n3. The article does not specifically mention the role of the \"economy minister\" but does talk about the government, which includes Tsipras as the Prime Minister. The summary's reference to the \"economy minister\" could be seen as a misrepresentation of Tsipras' actual position.\n\n4. The article provides a broader context of the situation, including the lack of protests in Athens, the influx of tourists, the potential consequences of the austerity measures, and the popularity of Tsipras despite the economic challenges. The summary does not capture these details but does not directly contradict them either.\n\n5. The article suggests that the Greek government is under pressure and has been \"battered into submission\" to accept the terms of the bailout. This sense of struggle is reflected in the summary's use of the word \"struggling.\"\n\n6. The article implies that the agreement on the loan deal is not yet finalized but is in progress. The summary also suggests an ongoing effort to agree on a loan deal.\n\nBased on the above reasoning:\n\nNo, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While the summary captures the essence of Tsipras and his government working on a loan deal, it incorrectly refers to Tsipras as the \"economy minister\" instead of the Prime Minister. Additionally, the summary lacks the depth and context provided in the article, but this does not necessarily make it inconsistent\u2014just less detailed. However, the misidentification of Tsipras' role is a key inconsistency."}
