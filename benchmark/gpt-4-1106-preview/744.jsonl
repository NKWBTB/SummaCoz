{"document": "A fugitive Iraqi militant leader and the former right-hand man of Saddam Hussein has reportedly been killed in a skirmish. Iraqi officials said Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri had died in fighting with government troops in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad. Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup.\u00a0Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency. Such attacks are relatively rare in Kurdistan, which has managed to insulate itself from the worst of the violence afflicting the rest of Iraq.

This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list.

The summary states that \"UNK ibrahim UNK died in fighting with government troops in UNK province, north of Baghdad.\" The article confirms that Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri was killed in fighting with government troops in Salahuddin province, which is north of Baghdad.\n\n2. The summary mentions that \"UNK was the king of clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after the invasion.\" The article also states that al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the pack of cards issued by the US military to identify the most-wanted members of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\n3. The summary refers to the individual as \"one of Hussein's most trusted circuits.\" This seems to be a typographical error or a misinterpretation of the text. The article describes al-Douri as \"one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen,\" which is consistent with the intended meaning but not with the exact wording used in the summary.\n\n4. The summary claims that \"he was the leader of the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after the invasion.\" This statement is not accurate. The article does not claim that al-Douri was the leader of the pack of cards; rather, it states that he was represented as the King of Clubs within that pack. The leader of the pack would imply the highest-ranking card, which would typically be the Ace of Spades, representing Saddam Hussein himself.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- The first point is consistent with the article.\n- The second point is consistent with the article.\n- The third point is not consistent due to a typographical error or misinterpretation.\n- The fourth point is not consistent as it misrepresents al-Douri's position within the pack of cards.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article due to the errors in points three and four."}
