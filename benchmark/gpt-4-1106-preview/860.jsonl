'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.'

The article confirms that Robert Hardy is indeed selling his collection of antiques and mentions the auction, but it does not specify that the entire collection is valued at exactly \u00a3100,000.
