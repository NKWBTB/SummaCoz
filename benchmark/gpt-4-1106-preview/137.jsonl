Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, is accused of using a phony social media account to kidnap 15-year-old Nichole Cable, of Glenburn, and kill her in May 2013. The Bangor Daily News\u00a0reports that Dube's ex-girlfriend Sarah Mersinger testified Monday that he told her he killed Nichole. Mersinger says Dube covered up Nichole's body with leaves and sticks. During an emotional testimony, she added: 'He told me that he strangled her at the end of her road. He said he put duct tape on her mouth, her eyes and on her hands and feet. Elaborate plot? Kyle Dube, 21, (pictured left in court last week) allegedly abducted Nichole Cable, 15, (right) in 2013 so that he could stage a rescue and be hailed as a hero. His ex-girlfriend has told a court he confessed to killing her and dumping her body in woodland in Bangor, Maine . 'He said he took her clothes off so the police dogs couldn\u2019t smell her.\u00a0He said he covered her with sticks and leaves, so they couldn\u2019t see her from the sky.' The court heard Mersinger would spend 18 or 19 days out of 21 at the house Dube shared with his parents and a four-year-old daughter from another relationship. Mersinger also told the jury that she had met Dube on Facebook, where they began messaging each other. They began dating in November 2012 but her mother didn\u2019t approve . Prosecutors say DNA evidence ties Dube to Nichole's disappearance. His attorneys say someone else killed the high school sophomore. Dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder, arguing that somebody else committed the crimes. During a court hearing last week, it was alleged Dube was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero. According to the prosecution, the bogus account was traced to his home, his DNA was found on a hat at the end of Nichole's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of Nichole's home. Accused: Prosecutors say Dube, pictured with his attorney during a hearing last Monday, left a hat with his DNA on it near Nichole's home . Defense attorney Wendy Hatch said last Monday that the state rushed to judge Dube, and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes. 'We are here to show you the state has holes in their case. They have mistakes, big mistakes,' Hatch told the jury, adding that Dube 'got up the next morning, got dressed, kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work.' Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber said Dube's DNA was also found on Cable's fingernails, and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared. He also said Dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense. 'Dube responded it was what he had done, that they didn't know he had done, that he was worried about,' Macomber said. Horrifying: The court heard Dube (mugshot left) covered Nichole's (right) body in leaves so she couldn't be seen from the sky and took her clothes off so police dogs couldn't smell her . The trial is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names. The case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in Old Town. Nichole's mother, Kristine Wiley, testified that she knew Dube as a friend of her daughter's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance. Between tears, she testified that Dube reached out to her with an offer to baby-sit her other children after Nichole vanished but before her body was found. Wiley said Dube first told her he had heard Wiley said he was responsible for Nichole's disappearance. Wiley said she denied the accusation and that Dube then told her 'if I needed anything, call' and that he would watch her other children for her. She said she never took him up on the offer.
