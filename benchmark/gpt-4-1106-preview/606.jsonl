The article does not provide information about this being the second match of a three-match series, and it does not specify the location as India.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary implies specific details about the format of the match, the day it occurred, and its place, which are not supported by the article's content. The article provides general information about a cricket match but lacks the specific details mentioned in the summary.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that Ireland made 165-5 in Greater Noida, and Afghanistan reached 171-4 with two overs to spare. This indicates that a match between Ireland and Afghanistan took place.\n\n2. The article states that \"The sides meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday.\" This implies that the match discussed in the article is not the second T20, but rather the one before it. Therefore, the match in the article should be the first T20 of the series.\n\n3. The summary claims that Ireland lost to Afghanistan in the second of the three-match Twenty20 series in India on Tuesday. However, based on the information in the article, the match described took place before the second T20, which is scheduled for Friday.\n\n4. The article does not specify the day of the week the match took place, but it does mention that the next match (the second T20) is on Friday. If we assume a typical schedule, the match described in the article likely took place earlier in the week, possibly on a Wednesday, as the article mentions a setback for the Irish on Wednesday.\n\n5. The article does not explicitly state that this was the first match of the series, but it can be inferred from the context that the match described is not the second T20.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the match as the second T20 when the article suggests it was the match prior to the second T20.\n\nAnswer: No"}
