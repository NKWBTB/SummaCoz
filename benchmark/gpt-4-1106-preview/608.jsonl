However, the article is about a cricket match between Ireland and Afghanistan, and it does not mention Ireland running in nine tries or playing rugby. Instead, the article discusses the scores and performance in a cricket match.\n3.

The article discusses a cricket match between Ireland and Afghanistan, focusing on the performance of individual players and the overall score.\n2. The article mentions that Stuart Thompson scored 56 runs, Gary Wilson scored 41 not out, and captain William Porterfield added 39 runs for Ireland.\n3. The article states that Ireland's total score was 165-5.\n4. It is mentioned that Afghanistan won the match with a score of 171-4, with two overs to spare.\n5. The article specifies that Samiullah Shenwari and Mohammad Shahzad were significant contributors to Afghanistan's victory, scoring 56 and 47 runs, respectively.\n6. The article does not mention anything about Ireland running in nine tries, which is a term used in rugby, not cricket.\n7. The article does not indicate that this match was the final of the first Twenty20 international; it simply states that the sides would meet again in the second T20 at the same venue on Friday.\n8. The article does not mention the location of the match as being in Afghanistan; it states the venue is Greater Noida, which is in India.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. The summary incorrectly uses rugby terminology (\"nine tries\") and incorrectly states that Ireland won the match, while the article clearly states that Afghanistan won. Additionally, the summary incorrectly refers to the match as the final of the first Twenty20 international and incorrectly suggests that the match took place in Afghanistan.\n\nAnswer: No"}
