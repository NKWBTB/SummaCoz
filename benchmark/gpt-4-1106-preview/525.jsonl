Instead, it mentions a Newport RFC chairman named Will Godfrey.\n- The summary incorrectly names Gavin Foxall as the chairman of Newport RFC.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n- The summary is inconsistent with the article because it incorrectly names the subject of the takeover bid (Newport RFC instead of Newport Gwent Dragons) and incorrectly attributes the chairman's name (Gavin Foxall instead of Will Godfrey).\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
