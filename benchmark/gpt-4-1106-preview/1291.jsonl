The article discusses a shift in responsibility for planning decisions from the Planning Service, an agency under Stormont's environment department, to local councils. This change is set to occur in April 2015.\n\n2. The article mentions that councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas, which implies that they will have the authority to make decisions on planning applications.\n\n3. The article does not state that Northern Ireland's councils have voted on any specific government plans for a new community. Instead, it talks about the general transfer of planning authority to the councils.\n\n4. The article presents various opinions on the transfer of planning authority, including optimism from Michael Corr, concerns from Friends of the Earth, and differing views from local politicians.\n\n5. The summary's claim that Northern Ireland's councils have voted to reject the government's plans for a new community is not supported by any information in the article. The article does not mention any vote on a specific plan for a new community, nor does it indicate that such a plan has been rejected.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
