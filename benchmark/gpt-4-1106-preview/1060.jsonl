The article discusses the disappearance of Trevor Deely, who was last seen in December 2000 in Dublin, not County Antrim. The summary incorrectly mentions County Antrim, which is in Northern Ireland, not the Republic of Ireland where the incident took place.\n\n2. The article does mention that CCTV footage was released by the detectives, which is consistent with the summary statement.\n\n3. The article specifies that the CCTV footage was enhanced and released in April, showing Mr. Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street. The summary does not provide these details but does not contradict them either.\n\n4. The article indicates that the police are interested in tracing a man seen in the CCTV footage, which aligns with the summary's mention of police wanting to trace a man.\n\n5. The article mentions that the man seen in the CCTV footage has not been identified and that there is an appeal for him to come forward. The summary does not contradict this information but lacks the detail that the man has not been identified.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the location of the disappearance as County Antrim instead of Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAnswer: No"}
