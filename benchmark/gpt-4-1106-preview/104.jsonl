Ministers hope to bolster existing checks to prevent serious and violent criminals from being allowed to enter the UK. Tighter measures:\u00a0Migrants who come to Britain to live or work must prove they have not committed a crime in the previous ten years under new measures to tighten up the nation\u2019s borders . Under the scheme, which will begin to be rolled-out in the summer, non-EU migrants wanting to move to Britain to live or work will be compelled to produce a certificate from the authorities in any country they have resided in the previous decade. This would disclose whether they had a clean criminal record or had committed offences.
