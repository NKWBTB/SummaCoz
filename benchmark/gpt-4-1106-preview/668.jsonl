Instead, it mentions that the Ministry of Justice acknowledges the issue and that the Justice Secretary has asked the Ministry to look into how prisons can be better equipped to handle such problems. The summary attributes a statement to the Justice Secretary that is not present in the article.\n\nStep 3: The summary simplifies the situation by not mentioning the specific types of contraband, such as mobile phones and synthetic cannabis, which are detailed in the article.\n\nStep 4: The summary does not include the additional information provided by the article, such as the local resident's experiences, the former inmate's claims about drones, or the Ministry of Justice's response to those claims.\n\nConclusion: The summary is partially consistent with the article in that it correctly identifies that contraband has been thrown over the prison wall.
