However, the article reports that the horse, named Many Clouds, collapsed and died after narrowly beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. There is no mention in the article of the horse being \"hit by a horse.\" The horse's death is attributed to a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly suggests that the horse died from being hit by another horse, whereas the article provides a different cause of death, a severe pulmonary haemorrhage, which is unrelated to being hit by another horse.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: The article states that the 10-year-old Irish-bred horse, Many Clouds, collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.\n\nStep 2: The article mentions that the horse was treated by veterinary staff before being pronounced dead and that the British Horseracing Authority confirmed the horse suffered from a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage.\"\n\nStep 3: The article does not mention any incident of the horse being hit by another horse.
