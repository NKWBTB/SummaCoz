It also mentions the impact on local businesses and the council's response, including a free crossing period and a review of the project.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the summary for consistency with the article.\nThe summary mentions \"a row has broken out,\" which implies a dispute or argument. However, the article does not explicitly state that there is a \"row\" or dispute. Instead, it describes the challenges faced by the ferry service and the concerns of local businesses, as well as the council's actions to address these issues.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the summary is consistent.\nThe summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. While the article does describe problems and concerns related to the ferry service, it does not mention a specific dispute or \"row\" breaking out. The summary's phrasing suggests a conflict that is not detailed in the article.\n\nFinal Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
