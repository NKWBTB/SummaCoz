The article states that Fosse Park is near junction 21 of the M1, but it does not specify that it is in Cumbria. Therefore, the location mentioned in the summary is not supported by the article.\n\n2. The article mentions that the new owners have met with the council, which is consistent with the summary stating that the owners have met in the city. However, the article specifies that they met with Blaby District Council, not just \"in the city.\"\n\n3. The article quotes Ernie White, leader of Blaby District Council, discussing the potential for a \"better view\" when entering the city. This aligns with the summary's mention of planning a \"better view.\"\n\n4. The article does not explicitly state that the people who met with the council are the \"new owners.\" It mentions that the park was bought in August for \u00a3345.5m and that the new owners had met with the council, but it does not directly refer to them as \"new owners\" in the context of the meeting.\n\n5. The summary does not mention any of the specific improvements that are being planned, such as addressing parking and congestion issues or the appearance of units, which are key points in the article.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the location of Fosse Park as being in Cumbria and lacks specific details provided in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
