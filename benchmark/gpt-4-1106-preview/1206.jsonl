The article discusses Manchester United's position at the top of the Premier League table after a win against Sunderland, with a focus on the comments made by Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\n2. Ferguson is quoted saying, \"We are not concerned with what we have left behind us, we are only focusing on what is in front of us,\" which indicates a forward-looking approach rather than a reflection on past achievements or the necessity of winning the title.\n\n3. Ferguson mentions the team's record of 25 wins out of the first 30 matches, which suggests satisfaction with the team's performance thus far.\n\n4. The article states that Manchester United is 15 points clear at the top of the table and that the next game is a derby against Manchester City, with United having a 15-point lead over City.\n\n5. Ferguson talks about making changes for the upcoming FA Cup quarter-final replay against Chelsea due to injuries and the return of certain players, but there is no direct quote or implication in the article that Ferguson said the club's players need to win the Premier League title this season because of the win at Sunderland.\n\n6. The summary's claim that \"Manchester United captain Sir Alex Ferguson says the club's players need to win the Premier League title this season despite their win at Sunderland\" is not directly supported by any quote or statement in the article. The article does not mention Ferguson explicitly stating the necessity of winning the title this season as a result of the win at Sunderland.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article because it attributes a specific intention to Ferguson (the need to win the Premier League title this season) that is not supported by the quotes or content provided in the article."}
