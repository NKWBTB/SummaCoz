{"document": "The regulator, NHS Improvement, said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill.\nLast year \u00a33.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by \u00a31bn by the end of this financial year.\nA cap was introduced in October and has so far saved \u00a3600m, the regulator said.\nIt means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted.\nThe aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them.\nAgency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.\nNHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short.\nThe latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be.\nAnd while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.\nThe figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.\nNHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.\nInformation on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work.\nIt found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors.

The article discusses NHS Improvement's desire for more progress in reducing the agency bill, which indicates a focus on financial management rather than a broad overhaul of spending plans.\n\n2. The article specifically mentions efforts to reduce spending on agency staff by introducing a cap on shift rates, which has saved \u00a3600m. This is a targeted measure rather than a comprehensive overhaul.\n\n3. The article does not mention a \"major overhaul\" of all spending plans but focuses on the issue of agency staff costs and the implementation of measures to control these costs.\n\n4. The summary's use of \"major overhaul\" suggests a wide-ranging and significant change in spending plans, which is not supported by the details in the article that focus on a specific aspect of spending (agency staff costs).\n\n5. The article also outlines future plans for publishing \"league tables\" and collecting information on high-earning agency staff, which are additional measures to address the specific issue of agency spending, not an overhaul of all spending plans.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the summary is not consistent with the article because it suggests a broader change in spending plans than what the article describes, which is focused on reducing the cost of agency staff.\n\nAnswer: No"}
