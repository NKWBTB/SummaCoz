The article states that \"Centre-back Anderson, 27, has cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.\" This indicates that Anderson is a centre-back, not a striker as mentioned in the summary.\n\n2. The article does not specify the length of Anderson's contract with the new club. Therefore, the claim in the summary that he has signed a two-year contract is not supported by the article.\n\n3. The article mentions that Anderson has joined National League rivals, but it does not explicitly state that the team he joined is Torquay United. However, the article does reference \"Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson,\" and the Gulls is a nickname for Torquay United, which implies that this is the team Anderson has joined.\n\n4. The article does confirm that Anderson was released from his previous club, as it mentions that he \"cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent.\"\n\nBased on the above points:\n\n- The summary incorrectly identifies Anderson as a striker when he is actually a centre-back.\n- The summary claims a two-year contract which is not mentioned in the article.\n- The summary correctly identifies that Anderson was released from his previous club and has joined a National League side, which can be inferred to be Torquay United.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
