'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.'
