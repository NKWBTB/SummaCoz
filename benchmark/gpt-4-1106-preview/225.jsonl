The summary mentions that \"Lopes is on a season-long loan from Les Dogues.\" This is not consistent with the article. The article states that Lopes is on a season-long loan with Les Dogues, not from them. Les Dogues is another name for Lille, so the loan is to Lille, not from them.\n\n3. The summary includes the name \"Marcos Rojo,\" which is not mentioned in the article. The article is about Marcos Lopes, not Marcos Rojo, who is a different football player. This is an inconsistency.\n\n4. The summary correctly states that \"Lopes is yet to appear in a Premier League match for City.\" This is supported by the article, which says the same.\n\n5.
