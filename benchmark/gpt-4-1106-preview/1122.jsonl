The article states that the 24-year-old was under contract with the Stags. The Stags is a nickname for Mansfield Town, so this part of the summary is consistent with the article.\n\n2. The article mentions that Marcus Bignot's side (which refers to the team he manages) have reached an agreement to bring the player in on a free transfer. This contradicts the summary, which claims that the player was signed for an undisclosed fee. A free transfer means there is no transfer fee involved.\n\n3. The article does not specify that the player is a striker, only that he is a 24-year-old ex-Burton player who has scored goals. Without more information, we cannot confirm the player's position as a striker.\n\n4. The article indicates that Marcus Bignot is the manager who has signed the player, not the player being signed. The summary incorrectly states that \"Marcus Bignot\" is the player being signed by Mansfield Town.\n\n5. The article does not mention any player being signed by the name of \"Marcus Bignot.\" Instead, it refers to Marcus Bignot as the manager making his first signing for the Mariners.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. It incorrectly states that a fee was involved in the transfer, misidentifies the player's position, and incorrectly names the player being signed as Marcus Bignot.\n\nAnswer: No"}
