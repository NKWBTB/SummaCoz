It was an online hater, not Rickie Fowler, who accused Alexis of being a 'gold digger.' Rickie Fowler defended Alexis against the accusation.\n\n3. \"`must be nice getting s *** free in life and not have to work for it'\" - This quote is consistent with the article, as it was the comment made by the online hater.\n\n4. \"alexis also was quick to judge and accused of working at mcdonald 's.\" - This is inconsistent with the article.
