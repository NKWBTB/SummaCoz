The article does not mention the location of the fire as being in \"Eamonn, County Down.\" Instead, it refers to a site on Duncan Street, with no specific mention of the city or county.\n\n2. The article does not state that the site was \"disused.\" It mentions that the site was operated by Asset and Land Group and that the Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire, implying that the site was in use.\n\n3. The summary states that the fire is \"to be investigated by the environment agency.\" The article does mention that the EA took enforcement action against the site operators and decided to revoke the environmental permit, but it does not explicitly state that the EA is investigating the fire itself. The cause of the fire is mentioned as \"undetermined,\" but there is no direct link made to an ongoing investigation by the EA into the fire.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies regarding the location of the fire, the status of the waste site, and the specific actions of the Environment Agency.\n\nAnswer: No"}
