There is no mention of \"Daisy Potts\" in the article, and the article does not connect \"star wars actress\" to any character in the movie.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, where it introduces a character named \"Daisy Potts\" and associates her with \"star wars actress,\" which is not supported by the article.

The article does not mention the name of the actress who will play Mrs. Potts, so we cannot confirm if \"Daisy Potts\" is the actress or if there is a mix-up with the character's name.\n\nStep 3: Look for any mention of \"Star Wars\" in the article. The article does not reference \"Star Wars\" or any actress from that franchise.\n\nStep 4: Confirm the nature of the film. The article states that it is a live-action remake of the Disney film \"Beauty and the Beast.\"\n\nStep 5: Compare the summary to the article. The summary incorrectly names the actress as \"Daisy Potts,\" which seems to be a confusion between the character's name (Mrs. Potts) and an actress's name. Additionally, there is no mention of a \"Star Wars\" actress, which makes the summary inconsistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
