Instead, it talks about Ross Kemp, who is an actor, not an actress. Additionally, the summary suggests that Barbara Kemp has returned to EastEnders, which is a confusion of names. The article actually states that Barbara Windsor's character has returned, and Ross Kemp is returning to join her for her final episodes.\n\nStep 4: Determine consistency.\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information regarding the names and genders of the people involved. The article is about Ross Kemp, an actor, returning to EastEnders, not an actress named Barbara Kemp.\n\nFinal Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
