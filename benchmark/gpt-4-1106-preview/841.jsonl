{"document": "The family of murdered Australian baseball player Chris Lane broke down in court as they listened to an emergency call revealing the distressing final moments of his life. The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past.

Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Another local, Richard Rhoades, who also tried to help Lane, said he took off his shirt to place it over Lane's face when they realised he was dead. 'I just thought it would be nice to close his eyes,' he said. Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'. The lawyer told the jury that for Luna to be found guilty of first degree murder, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the murder was premeditated. Prosecutors said Luna internationally pulled the trigger. The trial continues.

Additionally, the article does not mention Luna's parents, Donna and Peter Lane, responding to a 911 call or weeping during the call.\n3.

The summary incorrectly states that \"UNK luna, 17, was jogging in a ford focus with two teenage friends when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun.\" The article clearly states that it was Chris Lane who was jogging and was shot, not UNK Luna. Chancey Luna was the one charged with the murder and was in the Ford Focus from which the shot was allegedly fired.\n\n2. The summary mentions that \"his parents, donna and peter lane responded to 911 call made by witnesses who tried to resuscitate the man who had stopped breathing and wept during the 911 call.\" The article does not say that Chris Lane's parents responded to the 911 call. Instead, it describes how they listened to the 911 call in court, which was made by a witness named Joy Smith.\n\n3. The summary does not mention the correct name of the person charged with the murder. It uses \"UNK luna\" instead of the correct name, Chancey Luna.\n\n4. The summary fails to capture the emotional response of the family in court as described in the article. The article details how the family and friends, including Chris Lane's former girlfriend, broke down upon hearing the 911 call and seeing evidence presented in court.\n\n5. The summary does not mention any of the details provided in the article about the court proceedings, the evidence presented, or the statements made by the defense lawyer and the prosecutors.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and fails to accurately represent the information provided in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
