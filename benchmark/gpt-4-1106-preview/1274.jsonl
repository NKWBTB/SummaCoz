The summary incorrectly states that \"eastenders actress barbara kemp has returned to eastenders to return to eastenders for a second time.\" This statement is incorrect on multiple levels: the name is wrong (it should be Ross Kemp, not Barbara Kemp), and the summary does not accurately reflect the context of the return (it is to participate in the final episodes of Peggy Mitchell).\n\n4. The article provides detailed information about the context of Ross Kemp's return, his history on the show, and the significance of his character, Grant Mitchell.
