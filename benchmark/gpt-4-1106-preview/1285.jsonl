This is a specific claim that is not supported by any information in the article.\n\n2. The article discusses a testimonial game for Wayne Rooney, which is a match to honor his 12 years of service at Manchester United. It does not specify that the match is against Manchester United, but rather implies that it is between Rooney's only two professional clubs, which would be Manchester United and another club (not named in the provided text).\n\n3. The article does not mention the day of the week on which the match will take place. The summary's reference to \"Saturday\" is not corroborated by any details in the article.\n\n4. The article focuses on the fact that the testimonial game will be streamed globally and that proceeds will go to charity.
