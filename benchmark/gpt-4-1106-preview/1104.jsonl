The article states that Johnny McGurk, not identified as a \"former county down man,\" has been charged with theft. The article does not mention County Down, but rather County Londonderry, which is a different county in Northern Ireland.\n\n2. The article specifies the amount stolen as \u00a3572,206, which is not the same as the \u00a3500,000 mentioned in the summary.\n\n3. The article identifies the company from which the money was stolen as Patrick Bradley Ltd. There is no mention in the article that the company is owned by a former professional footballer. Instead, Johnny McGurk himself is noted as a former All-Ireland football champion.\n\n4. The article does not provide any information about the owner of Patrick Bradley Ltd, so we cannot confirm whether the owner is a former professional footballer or not.\n\nBased on these points:\n\n- The location (County Down vs. County Londonderry) is incorrect.\n- The amount stolen (\u00a3500,000 vs. \u00a3572,206) is incorrect.\n- The owner of the company's background is not mentioned, and the summary's claim about the company being owned by a former professional footballer is unsupported by the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
