The article discusses the situation in Greece, where the Syriza government, led by Alexis Tsipras, is poised to agree and implement austerity and liberalization measures as mandated by creditors.\n\n2. The article mentions that despite these measures, which were previously characterized as hateful by the government, there are no demonstrations on the streets of Athens.\n\n3. It is noted that Greece's resorts are busy and Athens airport expects a significant increase in arrivals, indicating a thriving tourism sector.\n\n4. The article questions why Greeks are not protesting against the austerity measures, including VAT increases, pension cuts, and other economic reforms.\n\n5. The article suggests that the Greek population may be waiting to see the full extent of the concessions made by Tsipras in the new bailout deal.\n\n6. Tsipras is described as remaining popular despite failing to end fiscal austerity and the additional burden of monetary austerity due to the partial closure of banks.\n\n7. The article concludes by suggesting that for the new bailout to be successful and lead to recovery, the creditors, particularly Brussels and Berlin, need to consider debt forgiveness for Greece.\n\nThe summary states that \"the new eurozone president, alexis tsipras, is in the hands of the rest of europe.\" This statement is not entirely accurate or supported by the article:\n\n- Alexis Tsipras is not referred to as the \"new eurozone president\" in the article. He is the leader of the Syriza government in Greece.\n- While the article does imply that Tsipras and Greece are under pressure from European creditors, the summary's phrasing oversimplifies the situation and does not capture the nuances discussed in the article, such as the popularity of Tsipras and the potential for debt forgiveness.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and oversimplifications that are not supported by the detailed information provided in the article."}
