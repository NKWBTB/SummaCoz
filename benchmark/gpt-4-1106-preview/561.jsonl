The summary states that the government has confirmed that gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men will be pardoned from next year.\n2. However, the article does not mention anything about gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men. Instead, the article discusses the intention to pardon gay and bisexual men who were convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, in line with England and Wales' plans for automatic pardons under 'Turing's Law.' The article mentions the process of presenting a motion in the assembly for approval, securing executive agreement, and the aim of equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary inaccurately suggesting that the pardons are specifically for those convicted of sexually abusing gay men, while the article focuses on the broader context of pardoning men convicted of abolished sexual offences.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses a motion that will be presented to the assembly for approval, which aims to bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales regarding the pardoning of men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences.\n\n2. The article refers to these pardons as 'Turing's Law', named after Alan Turing, and indicates that it will apply to both posthumous and living men convicted of such offences.\n\n3. The article mentions that the Justice Minister, Claire Sugden, has secured executive agreement for a legislative consent motion to pardon convictions related to abolished sexual offences.\n\n4. The article specifies that the motion will allow for equal treatment for gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland as for their counterparts in England and Wales.\n\n5. The article states that the minister intends to bring in arrangements \"as soon as possible\" but does not provide a specific timeline for when the pardons will be implemented.\n\n6. The article does not mention anything about the nature of the sexual offences, other than that they are now-abolished, nor does it specify that the pardons are for those convicted of sexually abusing gay men.\n\n7. The summary incorrectly states that the pardons are specifically for gay and bisexual men convicted of sexually abusing gay men, which is not supported by the article.\n\n8. The summary also claims that the pardons will be granted from next year, but the article does not provide any such timeline.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately specifies the nature of the offences and provides a timeline for the pardons that is not mentioned in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
