The summary claims that supermarkets of state-run paper in Singapore have been canceled due to the haze, while the article states that only seven firms, including major supermarkets, have been asked to declare that they are not sourcing materials from companies suspected of contributing to the haze.\n2. The summary uses the phrase \"state-run paper paper,\" which is not a correct phrase. The article does not mention anything about a state-run paper company, and it is likely that the summary is a typo or a misunderstanding.\n3. The summary uses the phrase \"because of the haze caused by the haze caused by the air\", which is not grammatical.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: The summary states that \"Singapore's state-run paper paper has cancelled all of its supermarkets because of the haze caused by the haze caused by the air.\" This statement is confusing and contains several inaccuracies. Firstly, there is no mention in the article of a \"state-run paper paper.\" It seems like there might be a typographical error here, and the intended phrase could be \"state-owned supermarket,\" which would refer to NTUC FairPrice mentioned in the article.\n\nStep 2: The article does not state that NTUC FairPrice or any other supermarkets have been cancelled. Instead, it mentions that NTUC FairPrice is removing products from one Indonesian firm, specifically paper products sourced from Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP), due to the haze crisis.\n\nStep 3: The summary incorrectly suggests that the cancellation of supermarkets is a direct result of the haze. The article does not support this claim. It only mentions that the haze has led to the cancellation of public events and school closures, not supermarkets.\n\nStep 4: The summary fails to capture the key points of the article, such as the request from the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) for retailers to declare their non-involvement with companies accused of contributing to the fires, and the broader context of the haze crisis in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn conclusion, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
