{"document": "(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut.

The summary states that \"ISIS released more than 200 Yazidis,\" which is consistent with the article's statement that \"ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis.\"\n\n2. The summary refers to the Yazidis as \"a minority group,\" which is supported by the article's description of the Yazidis as a minority whose members were affected by ISIS.\n\n3. The summary's phrase \"the Islamist terror group has been killed in recent summer\" is unclear and does not directly correlate with any specific information in the article. The article does mention that ISIS killed Yazidis, but the phrasing in the summary is ambiguous and could be interpreted as saying the terror group itself has been killed, which is not stated in the article.\n\n4. The summary notes that \"the ISIS released scores of other Yazidis, mainly children and the elderly,\" which aligns with the article's information that \"ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly.\"\n\n5. The summary mentions \"the Peshmerga commander says the freed Yazidis are released,\" which is a redundant statement but is consistent with the article's mention of a Peshmerga commander discussing the release of the Yazidis.\n\nOverall, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, but the phrase \"the Islamist terror group has been killed in recent summer\" is unclear and potentially misleading. If this phrase is interpreted as saying the terror group itself has been killed, it would not be consistent with the article, as the article does not state that ISIS has been killed. However, if the phrase is interpreted as saying that the terror group has killed (Yazidis) in the recent summer, it would be consistent but poorly worded.\n\nFinal Answer: No (due to the ambiguous and potentially misleading statement in the summary)."}
