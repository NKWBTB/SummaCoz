He also accuses the media of encouraging speculation through innuendo.\n\nStep 4: Check for any direct mention of a specific tweet.\nThe article does not mention a specific tweet but refers to \"some tweets\" from Mr. Campbell's Twitter account.\n\nStep 5: Compare the article's information with the summary.\nThe summary states that a pro-independence blogger (which is consistent with Mr. Campbell's description) has been arrested in connection with an alleged tweet posted on Twitter. However, the article does not specify a single tweet but mentions \"some tweets\" related to the harassment allegations.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary simplifies the situation by mentioning \"an alleged tweet,\" whereas the article discusses multiple tweets over a two-year period related to harassment allegations. The summary does not fully capture the complexity of the situation as described in the article. However, the summary is not inconsistent with the article; it just lacks the detail that the harassment involved multiple tweets.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the summary is consistent with the article, but it is not comprehensive."}
