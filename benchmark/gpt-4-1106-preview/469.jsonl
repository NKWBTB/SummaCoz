It only mentions that the site was operated by Asset and Land Group and that Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited was suspended from accepting waste after the fire.\n\nStep 3: Check who is investigating the fire.\nThe article mentions that the Environment Agency (EA) has taken enforcement action against the site operators and has revoked the environmental permit, but it does not explicitly state that the EA is investigating the cause of the fire.
