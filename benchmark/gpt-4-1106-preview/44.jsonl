Google stopped selling the first version of Glass and shut its Explorer program in January, moving the project out of its Google X research lab into a standalone unit. Ivy Ross remained head of the Glass team but Tony Fadell, head of Google's Nest connected home division, now oversees strategy for the project. Cources claim Fadell wants to redesign the headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until 'it's perfect'. 'It is a big and very fundamental platform for Google,' Schmidt told the WSJ. 'We ended the Explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project, which isn't true. 'Google is about taking risks and there's nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we're ending it.' He said Glass, like Google's self-driving car, is a long-term project. 'That's like saying the self-driving car is a disappointment because it's not driving me around now,' he said. 'These things take time.' Sources claim Glass' new boss Tony Fadell (pictured) wants to redesign the Google headset from 'scratch' and won't release it until it's complete.\u00a0One unnamed source told the New York Times that Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect' The firm brought in Tony Fadell from Nest - a home automation company Google bought in 2014 - to lead the team, replacing previous boss Ivy Ross. Ms Ross still works on the project and runs 'day-to-day' operations. In a statement in January, Mr Fadell said: 'Early Glass efforts have broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike. 'I'm excited to be working with Ivy to provide direction and support as she leads the team and we work together to integrate those learnings into future products.' An unnamed source added Mr Fadell 'is a product guy and he's not going to release something until it's perfect.' The previous Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (\u00a3990), and was launched in the US in 2013, and the UK last summer. Google announced it was killing off the current version of its Glass headset (pictured) last month. It didn't abandon the project entirely, though, and promised to develop smart glasses under a different guise . Google Glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm's Explorer programme. This programme gave developers the chance to buy Glass (pictured) for $1,500 (\u00a3990), and launched in the US in 2013 . The firm had already been thought to be developing a new version, with chips made by Intel, to go on sale later this year. Aside from saying it was committed to working on the future of the product, Google gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product. 'It's hard to believe Glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop,' the Glass team said in a post on Google+ last month. 'We kept on it, and when it started to come together, we began the Glass Explorer Program as a kind of 'open beta' to hear what people had to say.' 'Glass was in its infancy, and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk. 'Well, we still have some work to do, but now we're ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run.' Google boss Sergey Brin (pictured) was spotted without the high-tech specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event last year. Since the headset was unveiled in 2013, the 41-year-old was rarely seen without them.
