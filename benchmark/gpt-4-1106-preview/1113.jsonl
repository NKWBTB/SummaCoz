The article mentions that the body was found in Northampton, which is consistent with the summary.\n\n3. The article identifies the accused as Edward Tenniswood, a 51-year-old book-keeper.

The article specifies that the body was found at the defendant's terraced house on Stanley Road. The summary also mentions that the body was found in a house in Northampton, which is consistent with the article.\n\n5. The article does not mention the age of the woman in the summary (83 years old), which is a critical discrepancy.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the age of the victim.\n\nAnswer: No"}
