The article states that the 24-year-old (Vunipola) has been out of action since November with a knee injury. This matches the summary's mention of a knee injury.\n\n2. The article mentions that Vunipola is an England player, capped 32 times, but does not specify his position as a full-back. The summary incorrectly identifies him as a full-back.\n\n3. The article suggests that Vunipola's recovery has progressed quicker than expected and that he could be in contention to face Scotland on 11 March, or Ireland a week later. This indicates that he has not been ruled out of the Six Nations entirely.\n\n4. The article highlights that there were initial fears Vunipola would miss the whole of England's Six Nations title defence, but it is now understood that he has returned to full training and is looking sharp. This contradicts the summary's claim that he has been ruled out of the Six Nations.\n\n5. The article also mentions Vunipola's older brother, Mako, who has made a comeback from a knee problem, but this information is not relevant to the consistency of the summary regarding the younger Vunipola's injury status.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. It incorrectly states Vunipola's position and falsely claims that he has been ruled out of the Six Nations, whereas the article suggests he may still participate.\n\nAnswer: No"}
