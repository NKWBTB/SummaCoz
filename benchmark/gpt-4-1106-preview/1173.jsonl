The article discusses J.K. Rowling's experiences with receiving abusive comments on Twitter, particularly in relation to her political views on the Scottish independence referendum.\n\n2. Rowling mentions that she has been called \"a traitor\" and has blocked some abusive Twitter users, whom she believed were supporters of the Scottish National Party (SNP).\n\n3. She expresses that she does not feel responsible for protecting the image of any political party in the face of such behavior.\n\n4. The article also notes that Rowling has had positive interactions with SNP supporters and has found common political ground with many of them.\n\n5. Rowling's response to a suggestion that her books should be burned is to joke that she would \"bring marshmallows.\"\n\n6. The article concludes with information about the SNP's success in the recent election, becoming the third largest party in the UK.\n\n7. The summary, however, states that \"the snp has hit back at twitter after tweeting that she's not doing enough to protect her from abusive behaviour.\" This statement is not supported by the article. The article does not mention the SNP responding to Rowling's tweets or making any statement about her not doing enough to protect herself from abusive behavior.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not indicate that the SNP has responded to Rowling or criticized her for not protecting herself from abusive behavior on Twitter."}
