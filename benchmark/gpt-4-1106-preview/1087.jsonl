The article mentions that more than 5,300 bottles of alcohol were seized by investigators in the southern city of Liuzhou, which is located in China's Guangxi region. This information is consistent with the summary stating that a haul of alcohol was seized in China's Guangxi province.\n\n2. The article does not mention any arrests made in connection with the seized alcohol. It only states that police are investigating the two distillers. The summary incorrectly suggests that the haul of alcohol itself has been \"arrested,\" which is a misrepresentation since inanimate objects cannot be arrested.\n\n3. The article does not mention any court ruling. The summary includes a statement about a court in China ruling, which is not supported by any information in the article.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- The summary incorrectly personifies the haul of alcohol by stating it has been \"arrested.\"\n- The summary includes information about a court ruling that is not present in the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
