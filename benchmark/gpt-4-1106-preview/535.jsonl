The article does not mention that the museum is from the 18th century. It talks about the Wedgwood Museum and its collection, but there is no reference to the specific age of the museum itself.\n\n2. The location of the museum is stated to be in Barlaston, Staffordshire, not London. This is a key geographical discrepancy between the summary and the article.\n\n3. The article does discuss a campaign to save a collection from being sold at auction, which aligns with the summary's mention of an \"art collection campaign to save it from being sold at auction.\"\n\n4. The article does not mention anything about the museum reopening. It talks about the collection remaining on display at the museum, which implies that the museum is currently operational.\n\n5. The summary does not capture the essence of the article, which is about a successful fundraising campaign to save the Wedgwood Museum's collection from being auctioned to pay off pension debt, and the subsequent gifting of the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which will then loan it to the Wedgwood Museum.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the museum's century and location, and it omits key details about the fundraising campaign, the museum's current status, and the future plans for the collection.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
