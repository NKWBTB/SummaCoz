The article does not mention the \"president of the United Nations.\" Instead, it quotes Mohammad Thneibat, who is identified as Jordan's education minister.\n\n2. The article discusses the need for international financial support to help build schools and train teachers for refugees, specifically in Jordan, not Syria. While the refugees are from Syria, the support is being requested for efforts in Jordan.\n\n3. The article does not specifically call for the international community to support refugees in Syria; rather, it highlights the need for support in dealing with the influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring countries like Jordan.\n\n4. The summary simplifies the message of the article and changes the focus from the support needed for refugees in Jordan to a general call for support for refugees in Syria.\n\n5. The summary incorrectly attributes the call for support to the president of the United Nations, which is a position that does not exist (the closest equivalent would be the Secretary-General of the United Nations), and the article does not mention any statements from UN officials.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misidentifies the speaker, the position of the speaker, and the focus of the requested support.\n\nAnswer: No"}
