Instead, it is Barry Pring who was killed.\n- The article suggests that the family and authorities suspect that Barry Pring's wife may have been involved in his death, not the other way around.\n- The article does not indicate that Barry Pring made any statements, as he was the victim and is deceased.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly suggests that Barry Pring is the accused murderer in a trial, whereas the article actually describes Barry Pring as the victim of an unlawful killing.\n\nAnswer: No"}
