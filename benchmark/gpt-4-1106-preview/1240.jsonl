The article mentions that the victim was queuing for food at a restaurant in Canterbury when the assault occurred. The summary does not specify the location as Canterbury.\n\n2. The article states that the assault happened when three men entered the restaurant, were noisy, and bumped into people. It then specifies that one of the group set light to the woman's hair. The summary, however, mentions an attack by three youths but does not detail the nature of the attack.\n\n3. The article indicates that the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt. This contradicts the summary's claim that three people have been treated in hospital, which implies serious injuries.\n\n4. The article does not mention that three people were attacked or that they were treated in the hospital. It only refers to a single victim whose hair was set on fire.\n\n5. The article discusses the release of CCTV images to identify the suspects, while the summary does not mention this.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately states that three people were treated in the hospital and does not accurately reflect the details of the incident as described in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
