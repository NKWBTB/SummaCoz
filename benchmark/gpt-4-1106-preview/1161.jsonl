The summary states that the company behind the tidal lagoon project in Swansea Bay was \"disappointed\" that it received calls from the Welsh government for misleading data.

Instead, it reports that the Natural Resources Wales (NRW) estimated that the lagoon would result in 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, and Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) disputed these figures. The article mentions that NRW was very surprised and disappointed by TLP's criticism.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses a dispute between Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP), the company proposing the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW), the regulator providing estimates on the potential impact of the lagoon on fish populations.\n\n2. TLP is challenging NRW's estimates that the lagoon could result in the deaths of 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout as they migrate. TLP claims that NRW's figures lack a \"clear scientific basis\" and that NRW has refused to share its methodology.\n\n3. The article mentions that TLP has conducted its own computer modelling, which suggests a \"worst case scenario\" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish, a figure significantly lower than NRW's estimates.\n\n4. The article also includes comments from NRW, which stands by its figures and methodology, stating that they are based on the \"best available evidence\" and have been assessed by independent and technical experts.\n\n5. The article notes that the Welsh Government, represented by Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths, is \"very supportive\" of the scheme but is seeking clarity on the UK government's position.\n\n6. There is no mention in the article of TLP being \"disappointed\" by receiving calls from the Welsh Government for misleading data. The disappointment expressed by TLP is directed at NRW for their estimates and for not sharing their methodology.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. The article does not state that TLP received calls from the Welsh Government for misleading data. Instead, TLP is disappointed with NRW's estimates and their refusal to share the methodology behind those estimates. The Welsh Government is described as supportive of the project and is looking for clarity from the UK government, not accusing TLP of providing misleading data.\n\nAnswer: No"}
