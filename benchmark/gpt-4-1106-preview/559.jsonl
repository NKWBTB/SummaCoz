The summary states that the Northern Ireland Assembly has voted to introduce legislation to allow gay men to be convicted of sex offences.\n2. However, the article does not mention any voting or approval by the Northern Ireland Assembly to introduce legislation allowing gay men to be convicted of sex offences. Instead, it discusses the proposal to pardon men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences, including living gay and bisexual men.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary incorrectly suggesting that the Northern Ireland Assembly has voted in favor of legislation allowing convictions, which is not mentioned in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that Justice Minister Claire Sugden confirmed a motion will go before the assembly for approval. This indicates that the motion has not yet been voted on.\n\n2. The purpose of the motion is to bring Northern Ireland in line with England and Wales, where plans for automatic pardons were announced. This means that the motion is about pardoning, not about convicting individuals.\n\n3. The article specifically mentions that the proposals would see men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences receive posthumous pardons. This is the opposite of convicting; it's about clearing the names of those who were wrongfully convicted in the past.\n\n4. The law, dubbed 'Turing's Law', will allow living men convicted of such offences to apply for a pardon. Again, this is about pardoning, not about new convictions.\n\n5. The minister is quoted as saying this is an opportunity for the criminal justice system to try and right the wrongs of the past. This further emphasizes the corrective nature of the motion, rather than introducing new convictions.\n\n6. The summary states that the Northern Ireland Assembly has voted to introduce legislation to allow gay men to be convicted of sex offences. This is not supported by the article, which talks about pardoning past convictions, not about allowing new convictions.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The article is about pardoning past convictions, while the summary incorrectly suggests that it is about allowing new convictions."}
