The double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to McLaren in the early years and then moving to Mercedes for the 2013 season, despite the aristocracy of British motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team. The importance of making the correct decision was reinforced on the podium after Sunday\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix, when he saw Sebastian Vettel on the top step after the German\u2019s own successful move from Red Bull to Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton sits on the podium alongside Sebastian Vettel after he claimed his first victory for Ferrari . Hamilton, out of contract at the end of the season, says his new Mercedes deal will be completed this week . Hamilton, who finished second, also thought of Fernando Alonso, whose career management has been disastrous since he left Renault in 2005, the year he won the last of his two world titles. The Spaniard then walked out on McLaren when he could have won a third championship, went back to Renault as a stop-gap, joined Ferrari while it was moribund and returned to McLaren this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners Honda. Alonso managed less than half of Sunday\u2019s race before a cooling problem intervened. Vettel, in only his second race for Ferrari, won in the car Alonso had just vacated. \u2018It\u2019s nice to see Ferrari back up,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I sat next to Sebastian and thought to myself, \u201cWhat is Fernando thinking?\u201d I remember when I left McLaren and came here, we were better the next year. I had a good feeling then, but he\u2019s almost done the opposite of what I did. It could have been him today. It\u2019s just strange how things turn out. Hamilton finished behind race-winner Vettel in Sepang but still remains in the lead of the world championship . Hamilton led Vettel off the start-line at the Malaysian Grand Prix but eventually lost out to the German . \u2018McLaren are a fantastic team. It looks bad now but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get it together. Before you know it, it will be the three of us fighting, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u2019 Alonso\u2019s predicament is a terrible shame because he was the heir who supplanted Michael Schumacher as the German approached his first retirement in 2009. Hamilton, 30, does not want to fall into the same trap, and says he is ready to sign a new contract with Mercedes for three more years beyond this season. The tantalising prospect of his joining Ferrari, where he is hugely admired by president Sergio Marchionne, seems remote. They have Vettel and Hamilton is already part of a top team. No matter Sunday\u2019s result \u2014 Hamilton beaten on pure pace by Vettel\u2019s Ferrari \u2014 Mercedes are the team of the moment. Asked about signing for Ferrari, Hamilton said: \u2018No, don\u2019t be silly. My contract at Mercedes should be done this week. There\u2019s no reason why not. Honestly, it\u2019s 99.6 per cent done.\u2019 Hamilton is expected to earn more than his current annual \u00a320million salary when he pens his new deal . The exact terms of drivers\u2019 contracts are kept secret, but it is thought that Hamilton will get more than his current annual \u00a320million salary, though probably not match Vettel\u2019s deal at Ferrari, which could be worth up to \u00a335m if he collects all his bonuses and extras. The Mercedes board want their team to be cost-efficient and will not pay the Earth even for a driver of Hamilton\u2019s talent. As well as tying up the contract, Mercedes will spend the fortnight before the next race in China responding to the Ferrari challenge. It is believed that the cooler temperatures expected in Shanghai will favour Mercedes, but at least their defeat after eight successive wins relieved the monotony. \u2018I don\u2019t think Ferrari\u2019s win is a one-off,\u2019 said Hamilton. \u2018I don\u2019t think they were lucky or it was a fluke. There\u2019s always talk that they are easier on their tyres. \u2018I think we\u2019ll manage. We\u2019ve got a great group of people, a great approach, and from this we\u2019ll take a step back. \u2018Second for me and third for Nico (Rosberg) is still good but they\u2019re too close to us in the championship, so we\u2019ll work very hard to analyse. It was not a kick; it was a pinch. We have now got a race on our hands.\u2019 That is good news for the sport and hope for all the teams.", "claim": "the double world champion has chosen shrewdly in the early years. sebastian vettel is
