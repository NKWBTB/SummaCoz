The article states that \"Forwards coach McBryde assumes head coach responsibilities for the third time after leading Wales on tours in 2009 and 2013.\" This indicates that McBryde is taking on the role of head coach, but it does not specify that this is a new appointment; rather, it suggests that he has assumed this role before.\n\n2. The article mentions that McBryde is stepping in as head coach while Warren Gatland, the head coach of the British and Irish Lions, is away. This implies that McBryde's role as head coach is temporary and specific to the upcoming tour.\n\n3. The article does not state that the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has appointed \"new coaches\" but rather that McBryde will be leading the team and that the WRU will appoint assistant coaches to assist him.\n\n4. The article mentions that Martyn Phillips is the WRU chief executive, not that Martyn McBryde has been appointed as a coach.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly names \"Martyn McBryde\" as the person appointed by the WRU coaches, when in fact, it is Robin McBryde who is assuming head coach responsibilities, and Martyn Phillips is the WRU chief executive. Additionally, the summary suggests a new appointment, which the article does not support.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
