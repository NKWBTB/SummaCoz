The article mentions Cynthia Cheroitich, a 19-year-old woman, who hid in a wardrobe during an attack. This information is consistent with the summary stating that a Kenyan woman was hiding in a wardrobe.\n\n2. The article does not mention the city of Chernobyl. Instead, it describes an event involving a Kenyan woman, and there is no indication that the incident took place in Chernobyl, which is a city known for the nuclear disaster in Ukraine.\n\n3. The article does not describe the woman as escaping from the ground. It details how she remained hidden until she was convinced by security forces and a teacher that it was safe to come out.\n\n4. The summary does not capture the key elements of the article, such as the woman drinking body lotion due to hunger and thirst, the method of her eventual rescue, or the context of the attack.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer to the question is:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
