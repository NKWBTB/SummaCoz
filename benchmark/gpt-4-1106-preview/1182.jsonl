The article mentions that an energy drinks giant was considering a \u00a3200m offer for the Premier League club, West Ham. It does not state that West Ham made an offer to purchase another entity.\n\n2. The article specifies that Sullivan and Gold are the current majority stakeholders in West Ham, having bought their stake in 2010. There is no mention of them being a Chinese energy firm or West Ham making an offer for Sullivan.\n\n3. The article discusses the possibility of a minority shareholding being sold to clear debts and mentions the intention of Sullivan and Gold to pass the ownership to their children. There is no mention of West Ham making a takeover offer for any company.\n\n4. The summary incorrectly states that West Ham is making a takeover offer for a Chinese energy firm named Sullivan.
