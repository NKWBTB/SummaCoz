However, the article states \"Mr Haugh, 25, was stabbed in a laneway in the Marian estate in the early hours of Sunday\". The article does not mention the location being county limerick nor the time being August.\n3. The summary mentions \"a father-of-two\".

The article states that Mr. Haugh was stabbed and later pronounced dead, which is consistent with the notion of a murder charge in the summary.\n\n2. However, the article specifies that Robbie Walsh was charged with \"assault causing serious harm\" to Mr. Haugh, not with murder. This is a critical inconsistency, as the charges mentioned are different in severity and legal implications.\n\n3. The article does not mention Mr. Haugh being a father-of-two, which is a detail included in the summary. Without evidence from the article to support this claim, it introduces information that is not verified by the provided text.\n\n4. The article indicates that the incident occurred in the Marian estate, but it does not specify that this estate is in County Limerick. The summary's mention of County Limerick is therefore not corroborated by the article.\n\n5. The article mentions that the accused is to appear in court next week, but it does not provide a specific month, such as August. The summary's reference to August is not supported by the article.\n\n6. The article does not state that the man appeared in court; it only mentions that he has been remanded in custody to appear again in court next week. This is a subtle difference, but it is important to note that the summary's phrasing suggests a past court appearance, which is not explicitly confirmed by the article.\n\nBased on these points:\n\n- The charge mentioned in the summary is incorrect.\n- The victim's status as a father-of-two is not mentioned in the article.\n- The location of the incident is not confirmed to be in County Limerick by the article.\n- The timing of the court appearance and the specific mention of August are not supported by the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
