The article discusses a collection of about 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters, and photographs that were at risk of being auctioned to pay off a pottery firm's pension debt.\n\n2. The article mentions a successful public fundraising campaign that prevented the auction and allowed the collection to remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.\n\n3. The Art Fund led the campaign and will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which will then loan it to the Wedgwood Museum.\n\n4. The article does not mention the monetary value of the collection, only the number of items it contains.\n\n5. The article does not specify that the collection has been donated; rather, it implies that the collection was saved from auction through fundraising efforts.\n\n6. The article does not mention a county Durham museum; it specifically talks about the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because:\n- The article does not provide a monetary value for the collection, whereas the summary claims it is worth more than \u00a3100,000.\n- The article does not state that the collection has been donated; it was saved through fundraising and will be gifted to the Victoria and Albert Museum, not donated to a county Durham museum.\n- The location mentioned in the article is Barlaston, Staffordshire, not county Durham.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
