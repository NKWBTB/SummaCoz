The article mentions that Rockstar, not \"vlogtarter,\" has announced a delay in the game's release. The summary incorrectly names the company as \"vlogtarter.\"\n\n2. The article specifies that the game's release has been delayed until 24 March, not that it will be released this month. The summary incorrectly states the release is happening this month.\n\n3. The article talks about the latest version of an open-world adventure game, which is implied to be Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) due to the mention of Los Santos and Blaine County, as well as the PC version details. The summary refers to \"rocks,\" which does not align with the content of the article.\n\n4. The article provides a reason for the delay, mentioning the need for extra testing and polish, and includes a statement from Rockstar. This information is not present in the summary.\n\n5. The article also discusses the upcoming online heists for consoles, the release of screenshots from the PC version, and the game's performance capabilities (1080p at 60fps, up to 4K resolution, etc.). None of these details are included in the summary.\n\n6. The article mentions the minimum specifications required to run GTA V and the game's previous sales record. This information is not reflected in the summary.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. It incorrectly names the company, provides the wrong release timeframe, and omits significant details about the game and its release.\n\nAnswer:\nNo."}
