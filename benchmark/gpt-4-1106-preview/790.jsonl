{"document": "(CNN)They may not be \"Star Trek\"-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says. \"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,\" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. \"We know where to look. We know how to look,\" she said. \"In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road.\" NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. \"Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,\" the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. \"We are not talking about little green men,\" Stofan said at the panel. \"We are talking about little microbes.\" Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. \"I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,\" he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? \"Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,\" he said. \"And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.\"", "claim": "nasa scientist ellen stofan : `` i think we 're going to have strong indications of life beyond earth within a decade '' scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies . `` we know how to look , '' nasa chief scientist says . the hubble space telescope may not be `` star trek '' - type extraterrestrials .", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "23a0f5d45517620ea12e8af780b2fa1cd9a2373a", "model_name": "bus", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "GramE", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)They may not be \"Star Trek\"-type extraterrestrials, but we may be close to finding evidence of alien life, a NASA scientist says.", "\"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years,\" NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe.", "\"We know where to look.", "We know how to look,\" she said.", "\"In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it.", "And so I think we're definitely on the road.\"", "NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa.", "The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release.", "\"Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice,\" the agency noted.", "There are some caveats involved, of course.", "NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms.", "\"We are not talking about little green men,\" Stofan said at the panel.", "\"We are talking about little microbes.\"", "Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well.", "\"I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star,\" he said.", "And, he added, who knows what that life will look like?", "\"Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low,\" he said.", "\"And I think that's where it starts getting exceptionally exciting.\""], "sum_sents": ["nasa scientist ellen stofan : `` i think we 're going to have strong indications of life beyond earth within a decade ''", "scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies .", "`` we know how to look , '' nasa chief scientist says .", "the hubble space telescope may not be `` star trek '' - type extraterrestrials ."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 3, 6, 7], "cot": "1.

The summary implies that NASA scientist Ellen Stofan said, \"we know how to look.\"\n2. However, the article states that Ellen Stofan said, \"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary attributes the statement \"we know how to look\" directly to Ellen Stofan, while in the article, this statement is not explicitly made by her but rather a general assertion about humanity's capability.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: The summary begins by quoting NASA scientist Ellen Stofan, stating, \"I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade.\" This statement is consistent with the article, which includes the same quote from Stofan during a panel discussion.\n\nStep 2: The summary mentions that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies. This is also consistent with the article, which notes that NASA released a graphic showing evidence or indications of water on various celestial bodies, including Ceres and Europa.\n\nStep 3: The summary includes the phrase, \"We know how to look,\" which is attributed to the NASA chief scientist. This is a paraphrased version of what is in the article, where Stofan says, \"We know where to look. We know how to look.\"\n\nStep 4: The summary ends with a statement that the Hubble Space Telescope may not be \"Star Trek\"-type extraterrestrials. This seems to be a misinterpretation or a poorly constructed sentence. The article does not make a direct comparison between the Hubble Space Telescope and \"Star Trek\"-type extraterrestrials. Instead, it mentions that the Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries of water and that NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations but rather microorganisms.\n\nIn conclusion, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, but the final statement in the summary is confusing and does not accurately represent the content of the article. The Hubble Space Telescope is an instrument used for discoveries, not a type of extraterrestrial. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article due to the last statement."}
