The article also states that Joel Mooney has only made five appearances for Minstermen since joining them in May.\n4.

The article states that the 25-year-old player joined the Minstermen from Tranmere Rovers, not Oldham Athletic. This is a discrepancy in the team the player is transferring from.\n\n2. The article does not mention Alfreton Town at all. Instead, it talks about the Minstermen, which is a nickname for York City FC.

The article does not specify the player's position as a defender, nor does it mention his full name, Joel Mooney. The summary introduces this information without it being supported by the article.\n\n5.
