The article does not say that the competition will be announced on those dates; rather, it says that the competition will take place on those dates. The full Jamaican team list for the competition will be announced shortly, but the competition itself is already scheduled for May 2 and 3.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, but there is a minor discrepancy in the last point regarding the announcement of the competition.

Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article due to the incorrect implication about the announcement of the competition."}
