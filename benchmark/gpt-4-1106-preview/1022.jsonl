This indicates that Shutter Speed has not participated in the Epsom Derby, which is a separate event from the Oaks at Epsom.\n\n3. The article does not mention any back-to-back wins at the Epsom Derby for Shutter Speed. In fact, the Epsom Derby is not discussed in relation to Shutter Speed at all.\n\n4. The article does mention that Shutter Speed's last run at Newbury saw her beat Enable into third, which implies that Shutter Speed has been racing recently, but it does not support the claim of winning the Epsom Derby for the second year running.\n\n5. The summary's claim that Shutter Speed, ridden by Frankie Dettori, won the Epsom Derby for the second year running is not supported by any information in the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
