However, the article does not support this implication. The article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the wall of Chelmsford Prison and the concerns of residents and former inmates. It mentions a former inmate's claim about the use of drones for smuggling but does not mention a statement from the prison secretary about inmates being \"notorious\" due to a \"breakdown.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which attributes a statement to the prison secretary that is not found in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses Chelmsford Prison in Essex, where there have been numerous incidents of packages being thrown over the prison walls.\n\n2. A former inmate described the jail as \"notorious\" for being \"flooded\" with mobile phones and synthetic cannabis, which indicates a problem with contraband but does not mention a \"breakdown.\"\n\n3. The Ministry of Justice acknowledges the issue and mentions that staff work hard to prevent contraband from entering prisons. They also state that the Justice Secretary has asked for a review of the tools available to tackle the problem.\n\n4. A local resident has witnessed packages being thrown over the wall and has been invited to a meeting to discuss what to do if they see anything suspicious.\n\n5. The article mentions that there is no evidence of drones being used at the Chelmsford site, contrary to claims by a former inmate.\n\n6. The article concludes with information about the legal consequences for smuggling packages over prison walls.\n\nThe Summary's Analysis:\n\n- The summary incorrectly states that the \"prison secretary\" has said inmates at a prison in Essex have been left \"notorious\" because of a \"breakdown.\" The article does not mention a \"prison secretary\" nor does it use the word \"breakdown.\"\n- The article does mention that the prison is notorious for contraband, but this is attributed to a former inmate, not a prison secretary.\n- The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it introduces terms and roles not present in the original text.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
