The article states that FairPrice is removing products from one Indonesian firm, not \"removing the haze.\"\n\nStep 2: The article specifies that FairPrice is removing all paper products sourced from Asia Pulp and Paper Group (APP) due to the company being suspected of contributing to the haze. The summary does not mention this detail.\n\nStep 3: The summary incorrectly suggests that FairPrice is taking action to remove the haze itself, which is a natural phenomenon resulting from the forest fires. In reality, the supermarket is removing products associated with a company suspected of contributing to the cause of the haze.\n\nStep 4: The summary fails to capture the broader context provided by the article, such as the involvement of other firms, the joint statement by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), and the impact of the haze on the region, including the cancellation of public events and school closures.\n\nConclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately represents FairPrice's actions and omits key information provided in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
