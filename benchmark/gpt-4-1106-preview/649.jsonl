The article mentions a player named \"Anderson,\" but his first name is not given as \"Scott.\" The article simply refers to him as \"Centre-back Anderson, 27,\" so the first name \"Scott\" is not supported by the article.\n\n2. The article states that Anderson has \"cancelled his Barrow contract by mutual consent to join their National League rivals.\" There is no mention of a transfer fee, undisclosed or otherwise. The summary's mention of an \"undisclosed fee\" is not consistent with the article's description of the contract cancellation by mutual consent.\n\n3. The article does not specify that Anderson is joining Torquay United; it only mentions that he could feature against his old club on 18 February. The summary incorrectly states that Anderson is joining Torquay United from Torquay United, which is contradictory and does not make sense.\n\n4. The article does not support the claim that Torquay United has signed Anderson; it only mentions that he has cancelled his contract with Barrow.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
