{"document": "Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy . According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea .

The article states that \"a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued\" from Friday to Monday, which is consistent with the summary's claim that \"a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April.\"\n\n2. The Italian coast guard is quoted in the article as having received SOS calls from 20 boats in distress on a single day (Monday), which supports the summary's mention that \"the coast guard official says 20 boats are missing.\" However, the article does not state that the boats are \"missing,\" but that they were in distress and that calls were received.\n\n3. The article mentions that Save the Children fears \"400 migrants could be missing,\" which aligns with the summary's statement that \"the Italian coast guard says 400 migrants are missing in the Mediterranean Sea.\" However, the article attributes this fear to Save the Children, not directly to the Italian coast guard.\n\n4. The summary's claim that \"the 400 migrants have died while crossing the Libyan coast\" is not supported by the article. The article mentions that Save the Children fears that 400 migrants could be missing after a ship capsized, but it does not confirm their deaths. The Italian coast guard also did not confirm the incident and has not found evidence of such an event.\n\n5. The summary's statement that \"the group fears 400 migrants could be missing\" is consistent with the article, as it reflects the concerns raised by Save the Children based on survivor testimony.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not entirely consistent with the article. While it correctly states the number of migrants rescued and reflects the concern about the potentially missing 400 migrants, it inaccurately attributes the fear of missing migrants directly to the Italian coast guard and incorrectly asserts that the 400 migrants have died, which is not confirmed in the article. Additionally, the summary's mention of \"20 boats are missing\" is a misrepresentation of the article's content, which only speaks of distress calls received from 20 boats.\n\nAnswer: No"}
