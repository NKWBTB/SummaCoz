The summary does not mention that Pietersen is looking to force his way back into the Test set-up, but the article does.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The summary begins by mentioning the dismissal of Paul Downton as England's managing director. The article confirms this by stating, \"The dismissal of Paul Downton as England's managing director may be the big talking point in English cricket...\"\n\n2. The summary states that Kevin Pietersen joked with reporters at the KIA Oval for the photo. The article does not mention Pietersen joking with reporters specifically, but it does say he \"joked with photographers\" and was \"otherwise in a jovial mood.\"\n\n3. The summary mentions that Pietersen posed for the Surrey team photo shoot for Surrey at the new campaign. The article supports this by describing the scene where Pietersen took his place for the Surrey team photo shoot at the KIA Oval.\n\n4. The summary repeats the idea that Pietersen joked with photographers, which is consistent with the article's description of Pietersen's behavior during the photo session.\n\n5. The summary states that Pietersen is set to return to the international set-up after being axed by the former managing director in 2014. The article supports this by mentioning that Downton's sacking has paved the way for Pietersen's potential return to the international set-up, following his controversial axing in 2014.\n\n6. The summary contains a redundant phrase \"pietersen joked that he joked with photographers at the end of the season,\" which seems to be a mistake and does not align with any specific information in the article. Additionally, the phrase \"at the end of the season\" is not supported by the article, which does not mention the end of the season in relation to Pietersen's joking with photographers.\n\n7. The summary incorrectly refers to Paul Downton as \"paul downton host,\" which is not supported by the article and seems to be a typographical or grammatical error.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is mostly consistent with the article, but it contains a few errors and a redundant, unclear phrase. The mention of \"paul downton host\" is incorrect, and the phrase about Pietersen joking at the end of the season is not supported by the article. Additionally, the summary does not accurately reflect the detail that Pietersen joked with photographers, not reporters.\n\nAnswer: No"}
