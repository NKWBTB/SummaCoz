This indicates that Afghanistan won the match, which is consistent with the summary stating that Afghanistan beat Ireland.\n\n2. However, the article does not mention the match taking place in Nagpur. Instead, it mentions the venue as Greater Noida. This is a discrepancy between the article and the summary.\n\n3. The article does not specify the margin of victory in terms of runs. The summary claims that Afghanistan beat Ireland by 46 runs, but according to the scores provided in the article (171-4 for Afghanistan and 165-5 for Ireland), the margin of victory would be 6 runs, not 46.\n\n4. The article refers to the match as a T20 (Twenty20 International), which is consistent with the summary referring to it as a \"one-day twenty20 international.\"\n\nBased on the reasoning above:\n\n- The location of the match in the summary is incorrect.\n- The margin of victory in the summary is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
