The article does not mention Google at all. Instead, it lists other backers such as Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Indian tech giant Infosys, and Amazon Web Services.\n\n2. The article does mention a pledge of $1bn, but it is not attributed to Google. There is no indication in the article that Google is the source of this funding.\n\n3. The article discusses the research into artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential impacts on society, which is consistent with the summary's mention of research into AI.\n\n4. The summary's mention of the pledge being for both \"research and research into artificial intelligence (AI)\" is redundant and does not accurately reflect the article's content, which speaks of a broader goal to \"advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.\"\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes the $1bn pledge to Google, which is not mentioned in the article as a backer of the venture.\n\nAnswer: No"}
