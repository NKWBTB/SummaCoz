{"document": "Harry Kane's celebrations this season have always shown him to be an animated young man when he's on the pitch - but now he is being animated off it as well. The Tottenham sensation, who has broken through into the first team, and into Roy Hodgson's England side during a remarkable season, is nominated for both the PFA Player and Young Player of the Season. And now the Spurs striker features in a clever new animation, which features some of Kane's best goals, and celebrations from the season. Harry Kane celebrates yet another goal during what has been an incredible season for the young striker . Kane scores past Tim Krul for Spurs against Newcastle, his 20th Premier League goal of the season . The video, produced by Copa90, uses still photographs of the England forward placed one on top of the other to produce an animated effect. It features his long-range strike against Chelsea, a headed goal against Arsenal, and the moment he came on - and scored - on his England debut. The video is entitled 'Harry Kane - PFA Player of the Year?' and has been released ahead of the awards ceremony on Sunday, where Kane is up against the likes of Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez for the top prize.
