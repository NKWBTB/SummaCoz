There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"", "claim": "the scottish government has been accused of ``no magic bullet\\'\\'in the system of a tax on the system.", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "33811105", "model_name": "PtGen", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "xsum", "error_type": "EntE", "doc_sents": ["Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this", "linkA", "review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system.", "It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.", "The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.", "Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.", "He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.", "But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.", "Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.", "Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.", "But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated.", "There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.", "He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.", "\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So", "whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.", "\"The", "commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.", "A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".", "He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.", "\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\""], "sum_sents": ["the scottish government has been accused of ``no magic bullet\\'\\'in the system of a tax on the system."], "rel_index": [2, 4, 5, 6, 17], "cot": "1.

The summary implies that the Scottish government has been accused of lacking a \"magic bullet\" in the tax system.\n2. However, the article does not make an accusation against the Scottish government. It primarily discusses a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform and its findings about the council tax system in Scotland. The review suggests that there is no \"magic bullet\" to solve the problems in the tax system but does not make any accusations against the Scottish government.\n3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the introduction of an accusation that is not supported by the article's content. The article focuses on the findings of the review and the challenges of reforming the tax system rather than making accusations against the government.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: Identify the phrase \"no magic bullet\" in the article.\nThe article mentions that a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform stated there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system.\n\nStep 2: Determine the context of \"no magic bullet\" in the article.\nThe context in which \"no magic bullet\" is used in the article refers to the complexity of reforming the local tax system and the inherent difficulties in finding a perfect solution.\n\nStep 3: Assess the accuracy of the summary's statement.\nThe summary states that \"the Scottish government has been accused of 'no magic bullet' in the system of a tax on the system.\" This statement is misleading and does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article does not accuse the Scottish government of anything; rather, it reports on the findings of a review that acknowledges the complexity of tax reform and the absence of a simple solution.\n\nStep 4: Check for any additional inconsistencies.\nThe summary does not capture the essence of the article, which discusses the challenges of reforming the council tax system, the consideration of different forms of local taxation, and the plans for a public consultation before publishing a report. The summary also fails to mention the role of the Commission on Local Tax Reform, the involvement of Prof Kenneth Gibb, and the Scottish government's stance on the current council tax system.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
