It mentions delays in getting offenders to start their work and a leniency towards those who do not attend their assigned work.\n\nStep 2: The article does not state that offenders are being turned away from prison for unpaid work. Instead, it talks about offenders being ordered to do unpaid work as an alternative to imprisonment, and the challenges in managing and enforcing these community sentences.\n\nStep 3: The summary suggests that offenders are being turned away from prison specifically for unpaid work, which implies a direct exchange or decision-making process where unpaid work is the reason for not going to prison. The article does not support this claim. It only states that unpaid work may be given for certain offences as an alternative to imprisonment, not that offenders are actively being turned away from prison for this reason.\n\nStep 4: The article does mention that offenders are sometimes turned away from their unpaid work if they report on time, but this is a separate issue from being turned away from prison. It is about the management of the unpaid work itself, not the sentencing decision.\n\nConclusion: The summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents the relationship between unpaid work and prison sentences. The article does not support the claim that offenders are being turned away from prison for unpaid work; it only discusses the issues with the management and enforcement of unpaid work as a sentence.\n\nAnswer: No"}
