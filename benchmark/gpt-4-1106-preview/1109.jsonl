The article mentions that the Giants scored a goal through Derrick Walser and later goals by Mike Forney, Mike Radja, and James Desmarais, making it a total of 4 goals for the Giants.\n\n2. The article also mentions that the Panthers scored two goals, one by Jeff Dimmen and another by David Ling, making the score 4-2.\n\n3. The article states that the teams are set to meet again on Saturday night, which implies that the game discussed in the article did not take place on Saturday night.\n\n4. The article does not mention that the game was for the Elite League title, nor does it state that the Giants won the title.\n\n5. The article does provide the league standings, with Nottingham leading at 28 points, Sheffield Steelers at 27, and Belfast at 25. This suggests that the game's outcome did not determine the league title at that point since Belfast was not leading.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the game took place on Saturday night and that the Belfast Giants won the Elite League title as a result of this game.\n\nAnswer: No"}
