{"document": "(CNN)Buzz has surrounded HBO's new documentary \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,\" but Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, \"and I don't really care to.\" \"I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative,\" Travolta said. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, \"The Forger,\" in Clearwater, Florida. The HBO documentary is based on the book \"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of \"people who were disgruntled with their experiences\" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. \"I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?\" Travolta asked. \"It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine.\" He called Scientology \"brilliant\" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009. \"Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it,\" said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member. \"Honestly.\"", "claim": "hbo documentary `` going clear : scientology and the prison of belief , '' scientologist john travolta is not a fan . travolta says he has not seen the documentary , `` and i do n't really care to '' the actor , one of the church of scientology 's new film , is based on the book `` the forger , '' in clearwater , florida . travolta said he thought the doc was a factor .", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "cc86a588b4e4e038e2591c363b4b895e46edbeda", "model_name": "bus", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "EntE", "doc_sents": ["(CNN)Buzz has surrounded HBO's new documentary \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,\" but Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan.", "Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, \"and I don't really care to.\"", "\"I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative,\" Travolta said.", "The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members along with stars like Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley, is premiering his new film, \"The Forger,\" in Clearwater, Florida.", "The HBO documentary is based on the book \"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry.", "Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of \"people who were disgruntled with their experiences\" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him.", "\"I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?\" Travolta asked.", "\"It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine.\"", "He called Scientology \"brilliant\" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009.", "\"Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it,\" said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member.", "\"Honestly.\""], "sum_sents": ["hbo documentary `` going clear : scientology and the prison of belief , '' scientologist john travolta is not a fan .", "travolta says he has not seen the documentary , `` and i do n't really care to ''", "the actor , one of the church of scientology 's new film , is based on the book `` the forger , '' in clearwater , florida .", "travolta said he thought the doc was a factor ."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5], "cot": "1. The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that in the HBO documentary \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,\" Scientologist John Travolta is not a fan. Travolta says he has not seen the documentary, and he doesn't really care to. The actor, one of the Church of Scientology's members, is premiering his new film, \"The Forger,\" in Clearwater, Florida. Travolta thought the documentary was a factor.\n2. However, the article provides more context about John Travolta's views on the HBO documentary. It mentions that Travolta has not seen the documentary and doesn't really care to. It also talks about his positive experiences with Scientology, his belief that the documentary is a result of people who were disgruntled with their experiences, and his praise for Scientology as \"brilliant.\" The summary introduces information about Travolta's new film, \"The Forger,\" premiering in Clearwater, Florida, which is not explicitly mentioned in the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary adds information about Travolta's new film and mentions that he thought the documentary was a factor, which is not supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The summary begins by stating that John Travolta is not a fan of the HBO documentary \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief.\" This is consistent with the article, which quotes Travolta saying he has not seen the documentary and doesn't care to.\n\n2. The summary correctly quotes Travolta saying, \"and I don't really care to,\" which aligns with his statement in the article.\n\n3. The summary mentions that Travolta is one of the Church of Scientology's members, which is supported by the article stating he is one of the most high-profile members.\n\n4. The summary incorrectly states that Travolta's new film is \"based on the book 'the forger.'\" The article actually says that Travolta is premiering his new film, \"The Forger,\" in Clearwater, Florida, and does not imply that the film is based on a book. The documentary \"Going Clear\" is the one based on a book by Lawrence Wright.\n\n5. The summary suggests that Travolta thought the documentary was a factor, which is vague and does not accurately reflect Travolta's opinion as expressed in the article. Travolta believed the documentary was the result of \"people who were disgruntled with their experiences\" with Scientology, which is a more specific and different statement than saying the documentary was a factor.\n\n6. The summary omits Travolta's positive statements about Scientology and how it helped him, particularly through the death of his son, which are significant points in the article.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not entirely consistent with the article. It contains a factual error regarding Travolta's new film and omits significant details about his positive experiences with Scientology and how it helped him cope with personal tragedy. Additionally, it presents a vague statement about Travolta's thoughts on the documentary, which does not accurately reflect his quoted opinion in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
