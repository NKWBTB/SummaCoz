The article discusses a celebrity, referred to as PJS, who is appealing against an appeal court ruling that lifted a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales.\n\n2. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the case; it has stated that it will hear arguments about whether to grant an appeal. Therefore, the Supreme Court has not made a final decision on the matter.\n\n3. The article mentions that an interim injunction is in place until the end of the hearing, which prevents the media from naming the celebrity.\n\n4. The Sun on Sunday newspaper wants to publish an account of the celebrity's alleged extra-marital activities, but PJS is arguing for his right to privacy and has taken legal action to prevent this.\n\n5. The article does not state that the celebrity wants to publish details of an alleged sexual relationship. Instead, it is the Sun on Sunday that wants to publish these details, and the celebrity is fighting to keep them private.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary incorrectly suggests that the UK's Supreme Court has made a ruling, and it inaccurately portrays the celebrity as wanting to publish details of the alleged sexual relationship, when in fact the celebrity is trying to prevent the publication of these details.\n\nFinal Answer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
