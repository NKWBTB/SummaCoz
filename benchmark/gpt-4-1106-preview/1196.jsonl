The summary refers to the \"2017 Indian Super League,\" which is not mentioned in the article. The article does not specify the year of the competition, nor does it mention the \"Indian Super League,\" which is a football league, not a cricket league.\n\n2. The article is about a cricket competition, as evidenced by references to cricket-specific terms such as \"leading run-scorers,\" \"most sixes,\" \"highest score in an innings,\" and \"most wickets.\" These terms are associated with cricket, not football.\n\n3. The article mentions the \"Indian Premier League,\" which is a cricket league, and provides details about fixtures, results, and player statistics related to cricket.\n\n4. The summary states that the event will \"take place in the Indian Premier League later this week,\" which is inconsistent with the article. The article provides a schedule that includes dates for matches, with the final match taking place on Sunday, 29 May. There is no indication that the event is starting later this week; instead, the article provides a schedule that suggests the event is already ongoing.\n\n5. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article, as it confuses the sport (cricket vs. football), the name of the league (Indian Premier League vs. Indian Super League), and the timing of the event.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
