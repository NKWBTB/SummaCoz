The summary contradicts itself, as the Lib Dems can not reject calls by themselfs.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses a conflict between the Lib Dems (Liberal Democrats) and Labour, not an internal conflict within the Lib Dems. The summary incorrectly states that \"the lib dems have rejected calls by the liberal democrats,\" which suggests an internal disagreement within the Lib Dems, which is not supported by the article.\n\n2. The article mentions that the Lib Dems and Labour had previously cooperated on amendments concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal, but this cooperation ended when MPs rejected those amendments.\n\n3. The article does not mention any calls by the Lib Dems to set up a Brexit deal with the EU. Instead, it discusses the Lib Dems' insistence on certain amendments and Labour's decision to defer to the Commons' rejection of those amendments.\n\n4. The article describes the Lib Dems' criticism of Labour for not supporting their amendments and accuses Labour of \"waving through the government's plans\" and aligning with a hard Brexit. There is no mention of the Lib Dems making calls for a Brexit deal that were rejected by themselves.\n\n5. The summary does not capture the essence of the article, which is about the breakdown of cooperation between the Lib Dems and Labour in the Lords over Brexit-related amendments and the subsequent political maneuvering and accusations.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. It incorrectly suggests an internal conflict within the Lib Dems and does not accurately represent the content of the article, which is about the inter-party conflict between the Lib Dems and Labour."}
