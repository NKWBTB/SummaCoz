The article states that the world number 45 (who is not named in the summary but is implied to be Kyle Edmund based on the context) lost the match. The summary incorrectly states that Kyle Edmund is through to the quarter-finals, which contradicts the article's information that he lost.\n\n2. The article mentions that Edmund lost in three sets with scores of 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 6-4. The summary, however, provides different scores of 6-4, 6-3, which do not match the article's account of the match.\n\n3. The article does not mention the \"Indian Wells Fargo Championship.\" It does, however, mention the Chennai Open in India, which suggests that the tournament being referred to is different from the one in the summary.\n\n4. The article refers to Edmund as being 21 years old, but does not specify his British ranking number. The summary refers to him as \"British number three,\" which is not information provided in the article.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies regarding the outcome of the match, the scoreline, the tournament name, and Edmund's British ranking number.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
