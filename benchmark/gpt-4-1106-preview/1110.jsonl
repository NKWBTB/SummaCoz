If \"Mozart music\" is meant to refer to a portrait of Mozart himself, then the summary is partially correct in that a new portrait is being commissioned. However, the summary does not specify which orchestra is commissioning the portrait, and it incorrectly implies that this is the first time such a portrait has been commissioned by any royal orchestra. The article specifies that it is the Royal Northern Sinfonia commissioning the portrait, and it does not claim that this is the first time a royal orchestra has ever commissioned a portrait of Mozart.\n\nStep 7: Answer the question.\nNo, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article because it lacks specificity and contains an implication that is not supported by the article."}
