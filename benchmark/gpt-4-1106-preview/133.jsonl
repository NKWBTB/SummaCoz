The summary implies that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday, and the tower itself did not have significant damage, and the fire was halted around midnight.\n2. However, the article states that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday in the bell tower, specifically in the wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower as it undergoes restoration. The article mentions that the emergencies ministry for Moscow reported the tower itself did not suffer significant damage, and the fire's spread had been halted around midnight. The summary incorrectly mentions that the blaze broke out at the convent and in wooden scaffolding without specifying the bell tower. This creates a factual inconsistency.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary does not specify that the blaze occurred in the bell tower of the Novodevichy Convent and incorrectly attributes the lack of significant damage to the entire convent, not just the tower.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: The summary states that \"the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent broke out late yesterday,\" which is consistent with the article's information that the fire broke out last night.\n\nStep 2: The summary mentions that \"the tower itself did not have been halted around midnight.\" This statement seems to be a grammatical error or typo. The intended meaning might be that the fire had been halted around midnight, which is consistent with the article's statement that \"the fire's spread had been halted around midnight.\"\n\nStep 3: The summary notes that \"the blaze at the convent in Moscow broke out in wooden scaffolding,\" which aligns with the article's description that the fire broke out in wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower as it undergoes restoration.\n\nStep 4: The summary also states that \"the tower itself did not suffer significant damage and the fire is halted.\" The article confirms that \"the tower itself did not suffer significant damage,\" and as previously mentioned, it states that the fire's spread had been halted around midnight.\n\nBased on the steps above, the summary is consistent with the article, despite the minor grammatical error in the second sentence of the summary. The information presented in the summary is supported by the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes"}
