The article states that Luis Suarez was suspended for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, not a Spanish footballer. This is a key detail that is incorrect in the summary.\n\n2. The article mentions that the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) confirmed the sanctions imposed on Suarez by FIFA, but it also states that Cas found the complete ban from all football-related activity to be \"excessive.\" This means that while the ban was generally upheld, it was partially modified to allow Suarez to train and participate in other football-related activities.\n\n3. The article does not mention any extension of the ban; rather, it discusses the partial upholding and partial modification of the existing ban.\n\n4. The summary incorrectly states that the ban was extended to four months. The article indicates that the four-month ban was the original punishment from FIFA, and the appeal to Cas was about reducing or modifying this ban, not extending it.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about the nationality of the bitten player and falsely claims that the ban was extended.\n\nAnswer: No"}
