The article also discusses the strength of the Icelandic team, the importance of fan support, and the benefits of having Scottish players in top leagues around the world.

The summary incorrectly attributes the word \"humiliating\" to Anna Evans, which changes the sentiment of her statement and misrepresents her perspective on the upcoming match.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article because it misrepresents Anna Evans' sentiment by using the word \"humiliating,\" which is not supported by the article."}
