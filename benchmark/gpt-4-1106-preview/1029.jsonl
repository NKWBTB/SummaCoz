The summary states that NRW has accused the UK government of having \"unrealistic\" plans for a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay.\n2. However, the article does not mention any accusations by NRW against the UK government.

The article discusses a dispute between Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) regarding the potential impact of the Swansea tidal lagoon project on fish populations, specifically salmon and sea trout.\n\n2. NRW estimated that the lagoon could result in the death of 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout each year as they migrate. TLP disputes these figures, claiming they lack a \"clear scientific basis.\"\n\n3. TLP has criticized NRW for not sharing its methodology and for publishing figures based on \"what if\" scenarios that TLP considers unrealistic and misleading.\n\n4. The article mentions that the UK government is considering the findings of a review of the scheme's viability, and that the Welsh Government is supportive of the project, seeking clarity on the UK government's position.\n\n5. NRW defends its position by stating that it has assessed evidence from the applicant and had discussions with the developer, using independent and internal technical experts to ensure the best evidence available is used for decision-making.\n\n6. The article does not accuse the UK government of having \"unrealistic\" plans for the tidal lagoon; rather, it is TLP that is accusing NRW of using unrealistic figures in their assessment.\n\n7. The summary incorrectly attributes the accusation of \"unrealistic\" plans to NRW, when in fact it is TLP that is making claims about NRW's figures.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that NRW has accused the UK government of \"unrealistic\" plans for the tidal lagoon. The article actually describes a dispute between TLP and NRW over the environmental impact figures, with TLP challenging NRW's estimates.\n\nAnswer: No"}
