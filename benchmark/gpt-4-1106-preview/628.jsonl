The article mentions that the Su-24 jet was shot down on November 24, but it doesn't confirm whether that was a Saturday.\n3.

The article states that the \"black box\" of the Su-24 jet was officially opened in Moscow on Friday, not Saturday. This discrepancy in the day of the week is the first inconsistency.\n\n2. The article mentions that the downing of the jet has led to an investigation, which aligns with the summary's mention of a Russian investigation.\n\n3. The article specifies that the jet was shot down by Turkey, which is consistent with the summary stating the warplane was downed by Turkey.\n\n4. The article does not provide the exact date of the downing, but it does mention that the Su-24 was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November. Since the article does not specify the day of the week, we cannot confirm that the downing happened on a Saturday based on the information provided.\n\n5. The summary does not include any other details provided in the article, such as the opening of the black box, the missing flight information, the dispute over the jet's location, the sanctions imposed by Russia, or the specifics of the incident and its aftermath.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the day of the downing as Saturday, while the article does not specify the day of the week and provides a different date (24 November) for the incident."}
