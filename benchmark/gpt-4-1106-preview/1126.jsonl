The summary claims that Greenock Morton extended their lead at the top of the Scottish League Two table with a victory over Greenock Morton. This is inconsistent because a team cannot play against itself or extend a lead at the top of the table with a victory over itself.\n\nStep 4: Check for any mention of league standings or position in the article.
