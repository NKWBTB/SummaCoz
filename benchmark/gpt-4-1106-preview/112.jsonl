Plagad Somian, 23, began hassling Marek Pietrzycka, 45, when she saw him walking with his wife\u00a0Katarzyna in the street in Pattaya, a city on the east coast of Thailand known as a sex tourist hotspot. She reportedly told him to 'ditch the b**** and make the switch' which annoyed Mrs Pietrzycka, 42, who told Somian her husband was not interested before taking his hand and walking off. Katarzyne Pietrzycka, 42, was attacked with a stiletto by a Thai transvestite jealous over her husband, leaving her bleeding heavily from her head (right) following the assault in the east coast Thai city of Pattaya . Transvestite Plagad Somian, 23, has been arrested over the incident after allegedly flying into a jealous rage . Mrs Pietrzycka is comforted in hospital after the horror attack. She and her husband were trying to walk away . But as the couple tried to leave the brunette sex worker flipped, taking off her shoe and striking Pietrzycka in the face, knocking her to the ground and screaming: 'Don't f***ing mess with me you ugly whore.' Fellow tourist Oliver Kolar, 33, told local TV: 'The ladyboy had been talking to the woman's husband and she obviously didn't like it. 'The blonde started telling the man they were leaving, and the next thing you knew the ladyboy went mental, took off her shoe and smashed it into the woman's face. 'She was swearing a lot and when she attacked, the blonde went down like a tonne of bricks and was lying on the floor with blood streaming down her face. 'The ladyboy then hit her again and that's when the man, who I assumed was her husband, pulled her off.' Police quickly arrived on the scene and arrested Somian, who was being calmed down by fellow transvestites. Local man Son-Ram Wonggoun, 42, said: 'Foreigners are quite vulnerable around here and there have been a few incidents where they have been robbed or ripped off.

She reportedly shouted 'ditch the b**** and make the switch' before launching the attack . 'But I have never seen anything like this. 'The local working girls and ladyboys are temperamental but are normally very good to tourists as that is their trade. 'Attacking one is bad news for everyone as it will give us a bad reputation. 'People won't come here and enjoy what's on offer if they feel threatened by the prospect of violence. 'It was clear that this blond lady was on holiday with her man for sightseeing and not there for the other stuff. 'The ladyboy should have stayed away.' A police spokesman said: 'She admitted attacking the woman but said she had done it in a fit of rage at being slighted. She said the Polish woman had insulted her. 'She has been charged with causing bodily harm and is being kept in detention pending trial.'
