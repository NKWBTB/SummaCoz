The summary implies that a report has suggested \"unacceptable variations\" for older people living in residential care in Wales.\n2. However, the article is about the Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Sarah Rochira, who plans to call on pensioners and their friends and families to hear their experiences of residential care. The purpose is to gather evidence for her review into the quality of life and care of older people in residential care in Wales. The article mentions her concerns about the quality of life and care in residential care but does not attribute the phrase \"unacceptable variations\" to a report.\n3.
