{"document": "The dismissal of Paul Downton as England's managing director may be the big talking point in English cricket but focus has already shifted to the start of the county championship season.

Kevin Pietersen takes a moment to reflect ahead of a team photo shoot for Surrey . The event at the KIA Oval comes before the start of the County Championship season . As team-mates turn their attention to other matters, Pietersen looks ahead in deep thought . The batsman joked with photographers at the KIA Oval for the photo session, with Surrey set to begin their campaign at Glamorgan on April 19. Downton's sacking on Wednesday has paved the way for the 34-year-old to return to the international set-up having been controversially axed by the former managing director in 2014.

The article does not refer to Pietersen as the former England captain in the context of the current events. It focuses on his potential return to the England team and his participation in the Surrey team photo shoot.\n\n4. The article clearly states that Pietersen is in England at the KIA Oval with Surrey, not on tour in Australia. The summary incorrectly claims that Pietersen is currently on tour in Australia.\n\n5. The article does not mention any ongoing talks between Pietersen and Surrey; it simply states that his return to the international set-up has taken a step closer following Downton's sacking.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary contains multiple inaccuracies and is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
