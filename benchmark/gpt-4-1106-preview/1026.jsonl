The article mentions that a centre-back named Anderson, who is 27 years old, has cancelled his contract with Barrow to join their National League rivals. However, the summary incorrectly refers to \"Myles Keating\" as the player joining from Barrow, which is not supported by the article.\n\n2. The article does not mention anyone named \"Myles Keating.\" It does talk about a striker named Ruairi Keating, who is 21 years old and was recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson.\n\n3. The article states that Ruairi Keating has had spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United, and Finn Harps, and his move is subject to international clearance. There is no mention of a loan or the duration of his contract.\n\n4. The summary claims that both Myles Keating and Ruairi Keating are joining Torquay United on loan until January. The article does not support this claim. It does not mention a loan deal or a contract ending in January for any player.\n\n5. The article does not provide any information about a player named Myles Keating, which suggests that the name might be a confusion with Ruairi Keating.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly names a player as \"Myles Keating,\" attributes a loan deal until January which is not mentioned in the article, and suggests that two players named Keating are joining from Barrow, whereas the article only mentions Ruairi Keating.\n\nAnswer: No"}
