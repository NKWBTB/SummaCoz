The article mentions Pars (which is likely short for Dunfermline Athletic) and Ayr United.\n\nStep 2: Determine the scorer of the goals. The article states that El Bakhtaoui scored two goals for the visitors (which would be the team opposite of Ayr United, likely Dunfermline Athletic).\n\nStep 3: Assess the timing of the goals. The article mentions that the two goals were \"quick fire\" but does not specify that they were late in the game. It also mentions a \"late chance\" for Ayr United, which implies that Ayr United did not score late goals.\n\nStep 4: Check the outcome of the game. The article does not explicitly state the final score or the winner of the match, but it implies that Ayr United did not win since it mentions a missed late chance for them and does not mention them scoring any goals.\n\nStep 5: Compare the article's information with the summary. The summary claims that Ayr United scored two late goals to beat Ayr United. This is inconsistent with the article for several reasons: it incorrectly states that Ayr United beat themselves, it incorrectly claims that Ayr United scored two late goals, and it incorrectly implies that Ayr United won the match.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
