However, the article states that the fire broke out late yesterday in the bell tower of the Novodevichy Convent and that the emergencies ministry for Moscow mentioned the tower itself did not suffer significant damage. The article does not mention the exact time the fire was halted around midnight. The summary incorrectly states that the fire was halted around midnight, creating a factual inconsistency.\n3.

The article confirms this by saying, \"a huge fire breaking out last night in the bell tower of a Russian monastery.\"\n\nStep 2: The summary mentions that the tower itself did not have been halted around midnight. This seems to be a typographical error in the summary. The article actually states, \"the fire's spread had been halted around midnight,\" which means that the fire was stopped from spreading further, not that the tower itself had been halted.\n\nStep 3: The summary notes that the blaze at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow broke out in wooden scaffolding. The article supports this by mentioning, \"The blaze at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow broke out in wooden scaffolding surrounding the tower as it undergoes restoration.\"\n\nStep 4: The summary states that the emergencies ministry for Moscow said the tower itself did not suffer significant damage. The article confirms this information, stating, \"the emergencies ministry for Moscow said the tower itself did not suffer significant damage.\"\n\nBased on the steps above, the summary is consistent with the article, except for the typographical error in step 2, which seems to be a misinterpretation of the article's statement about the fire's spread being halted. If we correct the error to reflect the article's information accurately, the summary would be consistent with the article.\n\nFinal answer: No (due to the typographical error in the summary)."}
