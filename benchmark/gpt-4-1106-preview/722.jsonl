{"document": "It's amazing what a bit of make-up can do. In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale.

The summary statements are all supported by the article.\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the summary is consistent with the article.\n", "human_reason": "1. The summary implies that in a new YouTube tutorial, Promise Tamang transforms herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the movie of the same name. The summary also mentions the mother-of-six wearing cheek prosthetics. It suggests that Promise has made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and mentions Angelina Jolie.\n2. However, the article describes Promise Tamang's makeup transformation into Maleficent but doesn't mention Angelina Jolie wearing cheek prosthetics. The article mentions Promise transforming into Disney characters like Elsa from Frozen, but there is no direct mention of Angelina Jolie in this context.\n3. The inconsistency in the summary is due to the error in implying that Angelina Jolie used cheek prosthetics and combining details from various parts of the article into one sentence, making the summary confusing and inaccurate.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Let's break down the summary and compare it with the information provided in the article:\n\n1. \"in a new youtube tutorial promise tamang\" - The article mentions that Promise Tamang has created a new YouTube tutorial, so this part is consistent.\n\n2. \"angelina jolie 's character from the movie of the name\" - The article states that Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, the character played by Angelina Jolie in the movie of the same name. The summary omits the character's name, Maleficent, but the reference is clear and consistent with the article.\n\n3. \"the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to promise 's bone structure is a disney character\" - This part of the summary is confusing and incorrectly constructed. The article explains that Angelina Jolie, the mother-of-six, wore cheek prosthetics for the role, while Promise achieved the look through clever contouring. The summary seems to conflate the two and does not clearly convey the distinction made in the article. Additionally, the phrase \"is a disney character\" is out of context and does not make sense in the summary.\n\n4. \"promise has made videos of her as elsa from angelina jolie\" - The article does mention that Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen, but the summary incorrectly connects Elsa with Angelina Jolie. The correct information should separate the two individuals: Promise has transformed into Elsa, a Disney character, and separately, she has transformed into Maleficent, a character played by Angelina Jolie.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary contains inaccuracies and confusing statements that do not accurately reflect the content of the article. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
