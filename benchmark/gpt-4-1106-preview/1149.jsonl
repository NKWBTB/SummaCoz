The article states that Venera Minakhmetova died when she was struck by a lorry at Bow Roundabout on Wednesday. This information is consistent with the summary stating that a woman died after being hit by a lorry.\n\n2. The article specifies that Venera Minakhmetova was Russian and had been on the Cycle Superhighway 2 (CS2) just before the collision. This detail is not mentioned in the summary, but it does not contradict it either.\n\n3. The article mentions that Venera Minakhmetova was the fourth of five cyclists to die in London in nine days. This indicates that she was not the first woman to die in such an incident, as the summary incorrectly suggests.\n\n4. The location of the incident is described as Bow Roundabout in the article, which is in East London. The summary incorrectly refers to the location as \"central London.\"\n\n5. The article does not mention the gender of the lorry driver, so we cannot confirm whether the lorry driver was a woman as the summary suggests.\n\nBased on the above reasoning:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the lorry driver was a woman and that the victim was the first woman to die in such an incident in London, and it also incorrectly refers to the location of the incident as central London."}
