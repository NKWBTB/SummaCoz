The article states that the horse, Many Clouds, collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day. There is no mention of the horse falling from a balcony.\n\n2. The article specifies that Many Clouds was a 10-year-old Irish-bred horse, not an 11-year-old boy as mentioned in the summary.\n\n3. The cause of death provided in the article is a \"severe pulmonary haemorrhage,\" which occurred after the race, not due to a fall from a balcony.\n\n4. The article does not reveal any incident involving the death of an 11-year-old boy, which is completely unrelated to the content of the article.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces incorrect information about the cause of death (falling from a balcony), the age and species of the deceased (an 11-year-old boy instead of a 10-year-old horse), and an event (death of a boy) that is not mentioned at all in the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
