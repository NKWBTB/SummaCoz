The article discusses the situation after an election, not before one. It mentions that the election occurred \"almost two months ago,\" indicating that the election has already taken place.\n\n2. The article does not mention anything about a general election that is due to take place, nor does it discuss any fines, let alone a fine of up to 50%.\n\n3. The article talks about the efforts of Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il to avoid a second election, which implies that the first election has already been held.\n\n4. The article mentions the number of seats each party won in the past election, with Fine Gael having 50 seats and Fianna F\u00e1il having 44 seats. This is historical information, not a projection or condition for a future election.\n\n5. The summary does not accurately reflect the content of the article. It introduces information that is not present in the article, such as an upcoming general election and a fine.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
