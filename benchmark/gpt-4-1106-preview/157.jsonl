Detectives are hunting for the attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl last Friday. Officers described the footage as 'harrowing', but released it in an effort to identify the attacker, who struck at a bus stop on the outskirts of Leeds in the Beeston area of the city. The attacker drags the young 18-year-old girl from the bus stop into the front garden to begin his attack . The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to \u00a0pummel her with a large stone . The attacker, is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and is in his early 20s, with receding black hair. He is of slim build. The footage shows the man drag the girl onto an area of grass behind the busy bus stop. Detectives believe that several motorists passed the scene during the attack and fear that the man will strike again if not caught. Officers said the man hit the defenceless girl with a large stone to subdue her before subjecting her to a serious sexual assault. The unidentified man then left his victim for dead. Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'. He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor. 'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible. 'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it. 'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice. 'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.' He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties. If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.' At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot . Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari . The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week . The detective described the footage calling it 'harrowing in nature', but said police hoped its release may jog the memories of anyone in the area when the attack happened at 11.50pm last Friday. 'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop. It is absolutely appalling', he said. 'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead. 'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road. 'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless. 'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released. 'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his earlies twenties, slim, with receding black hair. 'He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue top with a hood.' Anyone knows any information about the brutal attack is urged to call West Yorkshire Police.", "claim": "detectives are hunting for the suspect who pounced on the 18-year-old girl. officers described the footage as 'harrowing' but released it in an effort to identify attacker. attacker drags the young girl from the bus stop into the front garden. attacker is described as being of pakistani or middle eastern origin. the man forces the ground and begins to pummel her with a large stone.", "cnndm_id": "741496791ddb4545ac38f7c87831cbbc34a35885", "annotations": [0], "dataset": "cogensumm", "origin": "cnndm", "doc_sents": ["These are the horrific scenes where a teenage girl was grabbed at a bus stop, dragged into a garden, beaten with a rock, and then brutally raped.", "Detectives are hunting for the attacker who pounced on the 18-year-old girl last Friday.", "Officers described the footage as 'harrowing', but released it in an effort to identify the attacker, who struck at a bus stop on the outskirts of Leeds in the Beeston area of the city.", "The attacker drags the young 18-year-old girl from the bus stop into the front garden to begin his attack .", "The man forces the young girl to the ground and begins to \u00a0pummel her with a large stone .", "The attacker, is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, and is in his early 20s, with receding black hair.", "He is of slim build.", "The footage shows the man drag the girl onto an area of grass behind the busy bus stop.", "Detectives believe that several motorists passed the scene during the attack and fear that the man will strike again if not caught.", "Officers said the man hit the defenceless girl with a large stone to subdue her before subjecting her to a serious sexual assault.", "The unidentified man then left his victim for dead.", "Superintendent Nick Wallen from West Yorkshire Police warned the assault 'could happen again'.", "He said: 'This is a completely out of the ordinary event and there seemed to be no pre-cursor.", "'We are urging residents to take more care and avoid walking alone at night were possible.", "'We thought very long and hard about releasing this footage due to the dramatic nature of it.", "'Securing the consent of the victim and her family was the main consideration and it is their express wish that we do this to assist in bringing the offender to justice.", "'We felt it was important to give people a first-hand insight into the nature of this offence in the hope it will encourage them to think very carefully about anything they may have seen in the area around the time or if they have any suspicions about someone they know.'", "He added: 'This is no time for family loyalties.", "If you suspects something about a family member or someone you live with, I urge you to come forward.'", "At the end of the attack, the man left his victim for dead before escaping the scene on foot .", "Police have released this E-Fit of the suspect who is in his 20s, slim build and with receding black hari .", "The girl was attacked at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds on Friday night last week .", "The detective described the footage calling it 'harrowing in nature', but said police hoped its release may jog the memories of anyone in the area when the attack happened at 11.50pm last Friday.", "'The moment the footage was played to officers, you could have heard a pin drop.", "It is absolutely appalling', he said.", "'We have understandably edited out the more graphic and disturbing moments when the victim is subjected to an appalling level of violence before being left for dead.", "'It does however show the victim struggling with the man as she is dragged into a nearby garden from the bus stop on Beeston Road.", "'The next clip shows the man walking calmly away as the victim lies motionless.", "'Although the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect directly it may be that something about the general size, shape or movement of the suspect means something to someone out there when put together with the e-fit image we have released.", "'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his earlies twenties, slim, with receding black hair.", "'He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue top with a hood.'", "Anyone knows any information about the brutal attack is urged to call West Yorkshire Police."], "sum_sents": ["detectives are hunting for the suspect who pounced on the 18-year-old girl.", "officers described the footage as 'harrowing' but released it in an effort to identify attacker.", "attacker drags the young girl from the bus stop into the front garden.", "attacker is described as being of pakistani or middle eastern origin.", "the man forces the ground and begins to pummel her with a large stone."], "rel_index": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 22], "cot": "1.
