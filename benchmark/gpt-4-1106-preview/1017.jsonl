The article states that the film \"Beauty and the Beast\" was due for release in Malaysia but was held for a \"review\" of its content by Disney. This indicates that there was a concern about the content of the film, which aligns with the summary's implication that authorities had an issue with the film's content.\n\n2. The article mentions that the Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) had approved the screening with a \"minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film.\" This suggests that there was a specific aspect of the film, described as a \"gay moment,\" that required editing before the film could be approved for screening.\n\n3. The article does not state that the film was found to be \"too gay\" by the authorities. Instead, it indicates that a minor edit was made to address the concerns related to the \"gay moment\" in the film.\n\n4. The article also includes a quote from the LPF Chairman, stating that the film has been approved and there is no more issue regarding its screening. This contradicts the summary's implication that the film was banned or found unacceptable in its entirety due to its content.\n\n5. The article does not provide any information suggesting that the film was banned or that the authorities concluded the film was \"too gay.\" It only mentions that there was a controversy and a review process that resulted in an approval with a minor edit.\n\n6. The summary's phrasing \"beauty and the beast is to be screened in malaysia after authorities found it was 'too gay'\" is misleading and does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article indicates that the film will be screened after a minor edit, not because it was found to be \"too gay.\"\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary misrepresents the situation by suggesting that the film was found to be \"too gay\" by authorities, which is not supported by the information provided in the article."}
