The summary states that Malaysia's aviation authority has decided not to broadcast a satellite tracking system for flight MH370.

However, the article does not mention anything revealed in 2015.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article states that the decision to dedicate part of the radio spectrum to a global flight tracking system was taken at a UN conference in Geneva, not by Malaysia's aviation authority.\n\n2. The conference aimed to improve the current tracking system, which indicates that the decision was to implement a satellite tracking system, not to refrain from broadcasting one.\n\n3. The article mentions that the decision was made by representatives from more than 160 countries at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organized by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), not by Malaysia alone.\n\n4. The article does not specify the year when the satellite tracking system was revealed, but it does mention that the disappearance of MH370 occurred in March 2014 and that the decision at the conference was made following that event.\n\n5. The summary incorrectly states that the decision was made in 2015, while the article does not provide a specific year for when the satellite tracking system was revealed.\n\n6. The article does not mention any decision by Malaysia's aviation authority to not broadcast a satellite tracking system for flight MH370.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes the decision to Malaysia's aviation authority, suggests that the decision was not to broadcast a satellite tracking system, and incorrectly states the year as 2015. The article, on the other hand, describes a collective international decision made at a UN conference to implement a satellite tracking system in response to the disappearance of MH370.\n\nAnswer: No"}
