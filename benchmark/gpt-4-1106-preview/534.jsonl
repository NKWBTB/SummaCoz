The article states that the collection was at risk of being auctioned but was saved by the fundraising campaign.\n- The summary does not mention the successful fundraising campaign or the fact that the collection will remain on display at the museum.\n- The summary does not specify the nature of the collection or its significance, both of which are detailed in the article.\n- The summary includes \"# [UNK],\" which seems to indicate an unknown value.
