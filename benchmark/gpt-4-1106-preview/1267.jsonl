The article states that the emergency services were called to a property in the Sangomore area of Durness, but it does not mention County Antrim. County Antrim is in Northern Ireland, while Durness is in Scotland, indicating a discrepancy in location.\n\n2. Police Scotland is mentioned as the responding agency, which aligns with the incident occurring in Scotland, not Northern Ireland.\n\n3. The article specifically mentions that \"initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances\" regarding the fire. This directly contradicts the summary's claim that the fire is being investigated as suspicious.\n\nBased on these points:\n\n- The location in the summary is incorrect.\n- The nature of the fire investigation is misrepresented in the summary.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
