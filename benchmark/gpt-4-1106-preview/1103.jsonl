The article does not mention that Ashya King was terminally ill. It discusses his treatment and the controversy surrounding it, but there is no statement about his condition being terminal.\n\n2. The article specifies that Ashya was being treated for a brain tumour, not leukaemia. This is a significant discrepancy as they are different conditions requiring different treatments.\n\n3. The summary states that Ashya \"suffered chemotherapy,\" which implies that he underwent chemotherapy treatment. However, the article clearly states that Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy recommended by doctors after the proton beam therapy in Prague.\n\n4. The article does not provide any quotes or statements from the family saying that Ashya suffered chemotherapy. Instead, it discusses the family's decision to seek proton beam therapy and their refusal of subsequent chemotherapy.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains incorrect information about Ashya's health condition (leukaemia instead of a brain tumour) and falsely claims that he underwent chemotherapy as per his family's statement.\n\nAnswer: No"}
