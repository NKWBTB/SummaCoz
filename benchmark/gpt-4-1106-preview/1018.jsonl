The article states that Acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Fine Gael and Miche\u00e1l Martin of Fianna F\u00e1il are hoping to avoid a second election. This information is not mentioned in the summary.\n\n2. Miche\u00e1l Martin has stated that Fianna F\u00e1il will facilitate a minority government but will not support a programme for government. This detail is not included in the summary.\n\n3. Water charges are mentioned as a main sticking point to reaching an agreement between the parties. The summary also mentions water charges but does not specify that they are a sticking point.\n\n4. The article discusses a proposal for a commission to consider the future of Irish Water, the national water utility. The summary does not mention this commission.\n\n5. Fianna F\u00e1il's position is to see the immediate removal of water charges, while Fine Gael sees a role for them. The summary does not reflect the differing positions of the two parties on water charges.\n\n6. The article provides specific numbers of seats won by each party in the election and notes that no party was able to form a majority government. This information is not present in the summary.\n\n7. The article mentions that TDs have failed to elect a taoiseach. This is not included in the summary.\n\nThe summary's statement that \"the republic of ireland's two main political parties are to vote on whether to take control of water charges\" is not directly supported by the article. The article discusses the disagreement over water charges and the consideration of a commission for Irish Water, but it does not mention a specific vote by the two parties on taking control of water charges.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
