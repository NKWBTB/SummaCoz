The summary states that a survey found that children who eat healthily are too fussy to eat healthily and that children have been cooked and cooked.\n2. However, the article does not discuss children being too fussy to eat healthily or being cooked and cooked. The article primarily focuses on children trying new foods at school, their preferences for certain vegetables, and the role of school meals in encouraging them to try new foods. The article also mentions parents giving packed lunches due to perceived fussiness, but it doesn't include the concept of children being \"cooked and cooked.\"\n3. The inconsistency is due to the summary presenting information that is not supported by the article, creating a misrepresentation of the content.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: The summary suggests that \"children who eat healthily is too fussy to eat healthily,\" which is a contradictory statement and does not clearly reflect any specific information from the article. The article does mention that some parents believe their children are too fussy to eat anything else, which is why they give them packed lunches instead of school lunches. However, the summary's phrasing is confusing and does not accurately represent this point.\n\nStep 2: The summary states \"a survey has found that children have been cooked and cooked.\" This part of the summary is unclear and grammatically incorrect. It seems to be an attempt to summarize the finding that children have asked for foods they've eaten at school to be cooked at home. However, the summary does not clearly convey this information.\n\nStep 3: The summary does not mention any of the key findings from the article, such as the fact that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home, or that the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn, and peas. It also omits the context provided by the School Food Trust and Mumsnet, as well as the statistics about the proportion of children eating school lunches in England and Scotland.\n\nConclusion: The summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. It contains unclear and contradictory statements and fails to accurately reflect the key points and findings from the article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
