However, the article clearly states that the woman lost money to the scammer, not that she claimed money.\n\nBased on these steps, the summary is not consistent with the article because it provides a specific figure of money (\u00a370,000) that is not mentioned in the article, and it inaccurately suggests that the woman claimed money from the scam rather than lost it.\n\nAnswer: No"}
