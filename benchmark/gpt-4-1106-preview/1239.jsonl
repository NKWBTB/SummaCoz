The article states that the controlled explosion at Singleton Park was a \"precautionary\" measure due to concerns about the safe storage of chemicals. There is no mention of anyone being taken to the hospital.\n\n2. South Wales Police indicated that nobody was injured during the incident, which contradicts the claim in the summary that a student was taken to the hospital.\n\n3. The article mentions that the incident caused \"some panic\" and lectures were moved, but it does not report any injuries or hospitalizations.\n\n4. The police stated that the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public, which contradicts the summary's description of the explosion as \"suspicious.\"\n\n5. The controlled explosion was carried out by the bomb disposal unit due to unstable chemicals, not because of a suspicious situation.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it inaccurately claims that a student was taken to the hospital and describes the explosion as \"suspicious.\"\n\nAnswer: No"}
