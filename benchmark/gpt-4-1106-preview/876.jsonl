{"document": "Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women. Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known\u00a0as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

However, the article provides information about septum piercing, but it does not mention the process as \"severing the wall between the two cheeks.\" Instead, it briefly discusses the historical and cultural significance of septum piercing in various regions and its modern use as a fashion trend. The summary's statement about the process of septum piercing is not accurately supported by the article.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary describes the septum piercing process differently from the article, which focuses on its historical and cultural context.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: Identify the key elements of the summary.\nThe summary mentions \"UNK,\" which seems to be a placeholder for an unspecified term, and it refers to \"the process of severing the wall between the two cheeks.\" It also states that \"the UNK ring is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls,\" which is mentioned twice.\n\nStep 2: Compare the summary elements with the article content.\nThe article discusses the septum piercing trend, not the severing of the wall between two cheeks. The septum piercing involves piercing the wall between the two nostrils, not cheeks. The article does mention that the septum ring, also known as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is used for controlling and handling bulls, which aligns with one part of the summary.\n\nStep 3: Assess the consistency of the summary with the article.\nThe summary incorrectly refers to the process as involving cheeks, which is not supported by the article. The article clearly states that the septum piercing is the piercing of the wall between the two nostrils. Additionally, the repetition of the statement about controlling and handling bulls in the summary does not add any new information and seems to be an error.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
