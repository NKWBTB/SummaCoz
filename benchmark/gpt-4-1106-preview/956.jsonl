{"document": "There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity\u00a0in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action. \u00a0Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans.

The summary states \"doncaster 's league one play-off draw at doncaster 's fleetwood town in league one.\" This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article does not mention a \"play-off draw\" but rather a regular League One encounter. Additionally, the match was between Doncaster Rovers and Fleetwood Town, not \"Doncaster's Fleetwood Town.\"\n\n2. The summary mentions \"doncaster 's media team won the match on 0-0 with 0-0 draw.\" This is incorrect and inconsistent with the article. The media team did not win the match; the match ended in a 0-0 draw. The media team's role was to compile the match highlights, not to participate in the outcome of the game.\n\n3. The summary's phrase \"saturday 's visit was so it was 27 seconds for the kick off\" is confusing and does not accurately reflect the content of the article. The article explains that the media team created a very short highlight video of the match that was 27 seconds long, including the kick-off, a goal kick, and the final whistle. The summary does not clearly convey this information.\n\n4. The summary does not mention the humor in the media team's decision to make the highlight video exceptionally short due to the lack of action in the game, which is a key point in the article.\n\n5. The summary fails to include the context that both teams had little to play for, with Doncaster in mid-table mediocrity and Fleetwood's play-off hopes having evaporated.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. It contains inaccuracies and fails to capture the essence of the article's content.\n\nAnswer: No"}
