The article discusses the Scottish women's national football team and their efforts to qualify for a major tournament, which is presumably the UEFA Women's Euro.\n\n2. The article mentions that the Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and are in a strong position to qualify for the finals in the Netherlands.\n\n3. Lisa Evans, a 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward, is quoted in the article expressing the team's desire to qualify and the emotional impact it would have, especially after previous disappointments in play-offs for Euro 2013 and the World Cup.\n\n4. The article does not directly quote Gemma Fay, the veteran goalkeeper, but it does reference her through Lisa Evans' statement about Fay's long-term aim to reach the finals.\n\n5. The article does not mention the year of the Euro that Scotland is attempting to qualify for, but given the context, it is likely referring to the UEFA Women's Euro 2017, as the finals are mentioned to be next summer, and the article's knowledge cutoff would not include information about Euro 2016, which would have already occurred.\n\n6. The summary incorrectly attributes a quote to Gemma Fay, stating that she says the team is \"desperate\" to qualify for Euro 2016. The article does not contain any direct quotes from Gemma Fay, and the sentiment of desperation is expressed by Lisa Evans, not Fay. Additionally, the year mentioned in the summary, 2016, is incorrect based on the context provided in the article.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly attributes a sentiment to Gemma Fay that is actually expressed by Lisa Evans in the article, and it references the wrong year for the European Championship the Scottish team is attempting to qualify for.\n\nAnswer: No"}
