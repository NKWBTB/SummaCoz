{"document": "Boss Nigel Pearson has urged Leicester to keep their cool and ignore their relegation rivals. The Foxes host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League after back-to-back wins. Last week's 3-2 win at West Brom handed them a survival lifeline, although they remain bottom of the table. Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival . Vardy celebrates in front of the travelling away fans after hitting the winner against West Brom . But after their mini-revival, Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs. 'I'm very wary of people flipping the emphasis,' he said. 'Our future is in our own hands and if we go into the last game with that we have given ourselves a realistic chance. 'We need to make sure our own run-in is what we want it to be. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has urged his players to focus on their own job and not worry about their relegation rivals during run-in . 'It's helpful that other teams are being dragged into it. People are continually adjusting the form table and their predictions. 'We can't get involved in anything apart from being involved in our own games that may change people's perceptions. 'It's great when results go your way but they only help if you've done your own job. 'It's important for us to be in touch. One of the potential problems we have to deal with is people are now overly optimistic.'", "claim": "jamie vardy scored an injury-time winner against west bromwich albion . swansea host swansea on saturday just three points from safety . west brom are bottom of the table . pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs .", "label": 0, "model_name": "M9", "cnndm_id": "dm-test-23e8c1d71474d239aa9ae37b9a05031b0054b8ce", "cut": "val", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "summeval", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "error", "doc_sents": ["Boss Nigel Pearson has urged Leicester to keep their cool and ignore their relegation rivals.", "The Foxes host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League after back-to-back wins.", "Last week's 3-2 win at West Brom handed them a survival lifeline, although they remain bottom of the table.", "Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival .", "Vardy celebrates in front of the travelling away fans after hitting the winner against West Brom .", "But after their mini-revival, Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs.", "'I'm very wary of people flipping the emphasis,' he said.", "'Our future is in our own hands and if we go into the last game with that we have given ourselves a realistic chance.", "'We need to make sure our own run-in is what we want it to be.", "Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has urged his players to focus on their own job and not worry about their relegation rivals during run-in .", "'It's helpful that other teams are being dragged into it.", "People are continually adjusting the form table and their predictions.", "'We can't get involved in anything apart from being involved in our own games that may change people's perceptions.", "'It's great when results go your way but they only help if you've done your own job.", "'It's important for us to be in touch.", "One of the potential problems we have to deal with is people are now overly optimistic.'"], "sum_sents": ["jamie vardy scored an injury-time winner against west bromwich albion .", "swansea host swansea on saturday just three points from safety .", "west brom are bottom of the table .", "pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs ."], "rel_index": [1, 2, 3, 5, 6], "cot": "1.
