The article discusses an incident at the compound of Mr. Ruto, the deputy president of Kenya, near the western city of Eldoret. The summary, however, mentions a shooting during an election rally in Nairobi, which is not mentioned in the article.\n\n2. The article states that Mr. Ruto and his family were not at the compound during the incident and that there was an intruder who had attacked a police officer and was hiding in a building. The summary does not mention any of these details.\n\n3. The article mentions that there were earlier reports of gunmen and gunfire at Mr. Ruto's home, and a police officer was wounded and in stable condition. The summary incorrectly states that a man was shot dead, which is not supported by the article.\n\n4. The article provides context about the upcoming presidential, legislative, and regional elections in Kenya, and the past violence associated with the 2007 elections.

The article mentions that Mr. Ruto had left for a campaign rally in Kitale, not Nairobi, and there is no mention of any violence or death occurring at that rally.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces an event\u2014a shooting death during an election rally in Nairobi\u2014that is not mentioned in the article, and it fails to accurately represent the details of the incident at Mr. Ruto's compound.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
