The article discusses the poverty rate in the US in 2011, which was 15%, and mentions that 46.2 million Americans were in poverty. This information does not pertain to the overall US population level but specifically to the poverty rate.\n\n2. The article states that the real median income of households dropped by 1.5%, which is a statistic about income levels, not the population count.\n\n3. The average poverty threshold for a family of four is given as $23,021. Again, this is related to the poverty measure, not the total population.\n\n4. Income inequality is mentioned with an increase in the Gini index by 1.6% in 2011. This is a measure of income distribution, not population size.\n\n5. There is a mention of a decrease in the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance, which went from 16.3% to 15.7%. This is about health insurance coverage, not the total number of people in the US.\n\n6. The article notes that poverty in the US reached a record high in 2010 at 15.1%. This is a historical reference to poverty rates, not to the population size.\n\nThe summary statement claims that \"the US population has fallen to its lowest level since records began,\" which is not supported by any information in the article. The article does not discuss the total population size or any decline in it. Instead, it focuses on poverty rates, income levels, and income inequality.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
