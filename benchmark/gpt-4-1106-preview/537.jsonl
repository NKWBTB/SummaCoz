The summary mentions a deal involving a person named Akil Wright and the club Sutton United.\n\nStep 3: Look for specific details in the article that match the summary.

Instead, it talks about a person named Wright who might buy 20% of Billericay Town and become a club director.\n\nStep 4: Check for any mention of Akil Wright or a midfielder signing in the article. The article does not mention anyone named Akil Wright or any deal related to a midfielder signing.\n\nStep 5: Assess the consistency of the summary with the article.
