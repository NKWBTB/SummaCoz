The article states that France's Dubuisson and Van Zyl of South Africa are tied on 16 under par. There is no mention of Rory McIlroy leading.\n\n2. McIlroy is mentioned to have moved to 15 under par, which is one shot behind the leaders, not in the lead.\n\n3. The article specifies that McIlroy carded a third straight five under-par 67, not a three-under as stated in the summary.\n\n4. The article does not mention anything about the WGC-HSBC Champions, so we cannot confirm that the event being discussed is indeed the WGC-HSBC Champions.\n\n5. The article does not state that McIlroy will take a one-shot lead into the final round, but rather that he is one shot behind the leaders.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states McIlroy's position in the tournament and his score for the round.\n\nAnswer: No"}
