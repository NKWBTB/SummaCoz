The summary includes a confusing statement: \"Hart has said Buffon is `50' at 37 years old.\" The article does not state that Buffon is 50 years old; it mentions that Buffon is 37 years old and that he claimed his 147th cap. The summary seems to incorrectly suggest Buffon's age as 50, which is not supported by the article.\n\n4. The summary ends with \"England ace Hart has been linked with his own cap.\" This is a vague statement, but it could be interpreted to mean that Hart has achieved his own milestone, which is consistent with the article's mention of Hart's 50th cap.\n\nOverall, the summary contains a significant error regarding Buffon's age, which is not consistent with the article.
