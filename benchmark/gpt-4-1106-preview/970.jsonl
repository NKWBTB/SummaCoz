{"document": "Gregory van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain in the summer and instead reiterated his 'love' for the club. The Dutchman recently had a falling out with his boss Laurent Blanc after the decision to drop the full back for the Champions League clash against Chelsea. But Van der Wiel insists he's happy in Paris and is making no plans to leave the Ligue 1 side. Gregory van der Wiel (right) says he's not interested in leaving Paris Saint-Germain in the summer . The full back had a recent spat with the manager Laurent Blanc (right) after he was dropped . He told L'Equipe: 'I am genuinely happy at PSG.

'If the coach decides not to play me, that is his decision. But I am ready whenever I am called upon.'

This key point is not mentioned in the summmary.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The summary states that Gregory van der Wiel has denied claims that he is set to leave Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. This is consistent with the article, which mentions that Van der Wiel has reiterated his 'love' for the club and is not interested in leaving.\n\n2. The summary mentions that the Dutchman recently had a falling out with his boss Laurent Blanc. This is also consistent with the article, which refers to a spat between Van der Wiel and Blanc after the player was dropped for a Champions League clash against Chelsea.\n\n3. The summary states that the Parisians continue to be linked with a move to French champions. This statement is somewhat ambiguous because it could be interpreted as Paris Saint-Germain being linked with a move to become French champions, which does not make sense as they are already a top team in France. However, given the context of the article, it seems the summary is attempting to convey that PSG continues to be linked with moves in the transfer market, which is consistent with the article's mention of Dani Alves being linked with a move to the French champions (PSG).\n\n4. The summary says that Dani Alves is being linked to move to the French champions league. This statement is inconsistent with the article. The article does not mention the \"French champions league\" but rather suggests that Dani Alves is being linked with a move to the French champions, meaning Paris Saint-Germain. The term \"French champions league\" is incorrect and misleading, as it confuses the domestic league title with the UEFA Champions League competition.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is mostly consistent with the article, but there is a significant error in the last statement regarding Dani Alves being linked to the \"French champions league\" instead of to Paris Saint-Germain, the French champions. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article."}
