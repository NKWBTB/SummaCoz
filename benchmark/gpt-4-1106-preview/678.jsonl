The article provides details about the ongoing search for Trevor Deely, the area being searched in Dublin, the involvement of the Irish police (Garda\u00ed), and the release of CCTV footage related to Deely's disappearance.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which incorrectly places the events in County Antrim, while the article is specific to the case of Trevor Deely in Dublin.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses the disappearance of Trevor Deely, who was last seen in December 2000 in Dublin, not County Antrim. The summary incorrectly mentions County Antrim, which is a different location in Northern Ireland.\n\n2. The article states that the Garda\u00ed (Irish police) have released CCTV footage and are appealing for a man seen in the footage to come forward. This part of the summary is consistent with the article.\n\n3. The article provides specific details about the CCTV footage, including that it shows Mr. Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street and that the same man was seen following Mr. Deely later on Haddington Road. The summary does not include these details but does not contradict them either.\n\n4. The article mentions that the search involves excavations in a specific area in Chapelizod in Dublin, which is not mentioned in the summary. However, the absence of this information in the summary does not make it inconsistent; it just lacks detail.\n\n5. The article specifies that the man has not yet been identified, which is implied in the summary by the statement that the police want to trace the man.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies the location of the disappearance as County Antrim instead of Dublin.\n\nAnswer: No"}
