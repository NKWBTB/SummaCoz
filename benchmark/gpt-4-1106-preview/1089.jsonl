The summary has combined these two separate individuals into one incorrect name.\n\n2. \"played cgi character ryan nyong 'o\" - This part of the summary is confusing and repeats the incorrect name \"Ryan Nyong'o.\" The article does mention that Nyong'o played a CGI character, but her name is Lupita Nyong'o, and she played Maz Kanata in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" not in the \"Black Panther\" film.\n\n3. \"played black panther in star wars\" - This statement is incorrect. The article does not state that Nyong'o played Black Panther in \"Star Wars.\" Chadwick Boseman is mentioned as playing Black Panther, but in \"Captain America: Civil War,\" not in \"Star Wars.\"\n\n4. \"in the new york panther film\" - The summary introduces the term \"new york panther film,\" which is not mentioned in the article.
