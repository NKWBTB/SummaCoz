The article does not mention a \"Billy McKenzie.\" Instead, it refers to a person with the last name \"McKenzie\" without providing a first name.\n\nStep 2: Consider the claim that he has become the first professional boxer to win a professional career. The article does not state that McKenzie is the first professional boxer to win a professional career. This statement is vague and does not align with any specific information provided in the article.\n\nStep 3: Review the article for any information that could support the summary's claim. The article discusses McKenzie's upcoming fight, his transition from football to boxing, his fight record, and his family background in boxing. None of this information suggests that he is the first to win a professional career in boxing, which is an unlikely claim given the long history of professional boxing.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether the summary is consistent with the article. Based on the analysis, the summary contains information that is not supported by the article: the incorrect first name and the unsubstantiated claim of being the first professional boxer to win a professional career.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
