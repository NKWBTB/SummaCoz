The article states that Jamie Mitchell, 35, admitted to intervening in an argument between Ken Dickie and his mother. This indicates that Jamie Mitchell was involved in an altercation, but it does not specify that he assaulted his mother.\n\n2. The article mentions that Jamie Mitchell and his mother, Samantha, admitted to attempting to pervert the course of justice by lying about the course of events. However, this does not equate to Jamie Mitchell being found guilty of assaulting his mother.\n\n3. The article specifies that Jamie Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight with Ken Dickie, not his mother.\n\n4. The article does not mention Jamie Mitchell being found guilty of assaulting his mother after Ken Dickie's death. Instead, it discusses the incident leading to Ken Dickie's death and the subsequent guilty plea to common assault and attempting to pervert the course of justice.\n\n5. The summary incorrectly states that a man (implying Jamie Mitchell) has been found guilty of assaulting his mother, which is not supported by the information in the article.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
