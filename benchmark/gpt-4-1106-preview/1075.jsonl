The article states that Curtis and assistant manager Paul Williams will take charge of the upcoming match, indicating that Curtis is in a temporary managerial position following Bob Bradley's sacking. However, the article does not mention anyone named Neil Curtis; it simply refers to Curtis without a first name.\n\n2. The article discusses the urgency of appointing a new manager, with Paul Clement being the first choice, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n\n3. The article quotes Curtis as saying, \"We've got to go with somebody who will to get us out of trouble,\" which implies a focus on avoiding relegation rather than the phrase \"get back up\" used in the summary. The phrase \"get back up\" would typically be used in the context of a team that has already been relegated and is looking to return to a higher league.\n\n4. The article does express concerns about the possibility of relegation and the difficulty of returning to the Premier League if that were to happen, but it does not use the phrase \"get back up\" in this context.\n\n5. The article mentions that Curtis believes the current squad is good enough to stay up, which is a sentiment about avoiding relegation rather than recovering from it.\n\n6. The summary's use of the phrase \"if they are to leave the premier league\" suggests a future conditional scenario, which is not directly supported by the article. The article discusses the potential difficulty of returning to the Premier League if relegated, but it does not confirm that Swansea City is leaving the Premier League.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly names the manager as \"Neil Curtis,\" uses the phrase \"get back up\" which is not supported by the article's context, and suggests a conditional future of leaving the Premier League which is not explicitly stated in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
