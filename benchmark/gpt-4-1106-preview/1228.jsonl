The article mentions that the 23-year-old from Kinross (Laura Muir) finished second behind Kenyan Faith Kipyegon, which indicates that she did not win the event she participated in.\n\n2. The article discusses a specific performance by Laura Muir in which she set a new Scottish record in the mile, not the 1500m. It states that she finished the race in four minutes, 19.12 seconds, which surpassed Yvonne Murray's previous Scottish record.\n\n3. The article does not mention the European Indoor Championships in Stockholm. Instead, it refers to Muir's next competition, which will be a 1500m race in Stockholm, but does not specify that it is part of the European Indoor Championships.\n\n4. The article does not state that Laura Muir won any title; it only mentions her record-setting performance and her second-place finish in the race discussed.\n\n5. The summary's claim that Laura Muir won the Scottish 1500m title at the European Indoor Championships in Stockholm is not supported by any information in the article.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
