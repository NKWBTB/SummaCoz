The summary implies that Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister, He Szijjarto, called on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws.\n2. However, the article does not mention He Szijjarto making such a statement or calling on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws. The article discusses Hungary's resistance to EU interference in its domestic issues and its objections to specific EU objections, such as tight controls on asylum seekers, regulations on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and a higher education law.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, introducing a statement by He Szijjarto that is unrelated to the article's content.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article mentions that the person speaking to Reuters is Mr. Szijjarto, but it does not specify his position as \"deputy prime minister.\" Instead, it refers to him simply as \"the minister,\" which implies he is a member of the government, but his exact title is not given in the provided text.\n\n2. The summary states that Mr. Szijjarto has called on the European Commission to block EU laws against EU laws. This is not supported by the article. The article indicates that Mr. Szijjarto has expressed that the EU should not interfere with Hungary's \"domestic issues\" and that he believes the laws in question are within national competence. There is no mention of him asking the European Commission to block any laws.\n\n3. The article does discuss Hungary's position on certain laws that the EU objects to, such as those concerning asylum seekers, NGOs, and higher education. However, it does not state that Mr. Szijjarto is asking for a block on EU laws; rather, he is defending Hungary's right to pass and maintain its own laws.\n\n4. The article also mentions that Mr. Szijjarto has won backing from Poland, which would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights. This is a defensive action against potential EU sanctions, not a proactive call to block EU laws.\n\n5. The summary's statement is overly broad and does not accurately reflect the specific issues discussed in the article, which are related to Hungary's internal laws and the EU's response to them.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. The summary inaccurately describes Mr. Szijjarto's position and incorrectly states his actions regarding the European Commission and EU laws."}
