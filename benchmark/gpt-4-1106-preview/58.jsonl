{"filename": "val_sentence_pairs.json", "label": 0, "document": "A millionaire Tory donor and prominent party supporter has been a heavy cocaine user for years, the Daily Mail can reveal. The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug. He has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes. The businessman\u2019s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug (file image above) Just last month he attended the party\u2019s high-profile donors\u2019 ball, and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of Government policies. But despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him, he has now admitted \u2013 behind closed doors \u2013 to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis. His consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day \u2013 because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much. And remarkably \u2013 despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years \u2013 the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction. However he is not shy about appearing in the public eye. He always seems full of energy when caught on camera, and has been very talkative with journalists. He has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business, putting many details about his life into the public domain. The addict has also spoken out against Labour policies and in favour of the Conservative Government \u2013 including for moves which benefited him financially. Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball attended by David and Samantha Cameron in 2007 (above) The donor refused to comment, however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction, a source close to him said: \u2018There\u2019s a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified. \u2018He is not a well man. He\u2019s trying to sort it out and sort himself out. He definitely doesn't want to talk about it at this stage.\u2019 Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball \u2013 a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich. The most recent ball \u2013 at the Grosvenor House Hotel on exclusive Park Lane \u2013 attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders. Tables for ten at the February event cost up to \u00a315,000 each, while the minimum price for a single ticket was \u00a3500. Dinner was scheduled to go on for three-and-a-half hours with speeches by Mr Cameron and the Conservative chairman Lord Feldman. Guests could bid to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May, have a cup of tea with Boris Johnson, go for a 10km run with Iain Duncan Smith, or have a week in a luxury chalet in Switzerland. In the final big fundraiser ahead of the general election, \u00a3210,000 was spent on a bronze bust of Margaret Thatcher and \u00a3220,000 was bid for a week-long holiday in a Spanish fortress. One of the paying guests forked out \u00a3110,000 at the auction for a single night\u2019s exclusive use of Annabel\u2019s nightclub. But a major cocaine abuser was also among them, rubbing shoulders not just with hedge fund managers and oil tycoons, but also with major party figures \u2013 including Chief Whip Michael Gove, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.
