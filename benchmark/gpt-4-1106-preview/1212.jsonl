The article discusses the decommissioned Type 22 frigates HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham, and HMS Cornwall, which are moored in Portsmouth Harbour.\n\n2. It mentions that bidders had a deadline to register interest in these former Devonport-based ships and that no proposals to preserve the ships have been submitted.\n\n3. The article states that those who have registered interest are finalizing their bids, with viewings set to take place in late February and March, and a final decision is expected in the spring.\n\n4. The government's Disposal Services Authority is handling the sale and is interested in awarding at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler.\n\n5. Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, expresses a preference for at least one of the ships to be turned into a reef and diving attraction, rather than being scrapped, for the sake of tourism and giving the ships a \"noble second life.\"\n\n6. The Ministry of Defence is looking for the best financial return for the taxpayer and will consider all options for the frigates.\n\n7. The article provides some background on the Type 22 frigates and mentions the sale of the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal as scrap the previous year.\n\nNowhere in the article is there mention of plans to build a new generation of Royal Navy frigates on the Isle of Wight. The article is focused on the disposal and potential recycling of old frigates, not the construction of new ones.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
