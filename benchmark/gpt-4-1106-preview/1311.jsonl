The article discusses a player named Clarkson who has joined St Mirren, not Bristol Rovers. There is no mention of Bristol Rovers signing Clarkson in the article provided.\n\n2. The article does not state that Clarkson is on loan from Brentford. Instead, it mentions that Clarkson has previously played for Brentford, among other teams, but it does not specify the current contractual situation or any loan agreement.\n\n3. The article does not specify the duration of Clarkson's contract or agreement with St Mirren, so there is no support for the claim that it is until the end of the season.\n\n4. The article is focused on Clarkson's move to St Mirren and his potential debut in the Championship against Alloa. It does not discuss any transfer or loan to or from Brentford.\n\n5. The summary's claim that Bristol Rovers have signed Jeremy Clarkson on loan from Brentford is not supported by any information in the article. The article is about Clarkson's involvement with St Mirren, not Bristol Rovers or Brentford.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
