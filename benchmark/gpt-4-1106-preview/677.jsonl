This indicates that the police are indeed searching for the missing man.\n\nStep 3: The article does not explicitly state that the police are currently searching for the man who has been missing for more than 20 years, but it can be inferred from the context that the search and investigation efforts mentioned are related to Trevor Deely's disappearance.\n\nStep 4: The summary does not contradict any information provided in the article.
