{"document": "A southern Iowa chiropractor accused of accepting sex as payment for his services and performing exorcisms on patients has surrendered his state license. The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com . The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive. The disgraced chiropractor received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction.

The summary states that the Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report detailing charges against Charles Manuel. This is consistent with the article, which mentions the same.\n\n2. The summary mentions that Manuel signed an agreement last month. The article confirms this by stating that Manuel signed an agreement admitting his misdeeds.\n\n3. The summary notes that Manuel has surrendered his license to practice due to admitting to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. This is consistent with the article's information.\n\n4. The summary states that he has received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com. The article supports this by mentioning that despite the charges, he received a perfect five out of five stars in patient satisfaction based on three patient survey responses.\n\n5. The summary claims that Manuel recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. However, the article does not mention Manuel prescribing medication or advising patients to stop taking it. It only mentions that he recommended patients stop taking medication, but it does not specify that he prescribed those medications.\n\n6. The summary suggests that Manuel can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. The article does say that the agreement requires Manuel to prove that the circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practice, but it does not guarantee that he can resume practice, only that he has the possibility if he meets the conditions after at least 10 years.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that Manuel prescribed medication to patients and advised them to stop taking it, which is not supported by the information in the article."}
