The article states that Sidwell is a midfielder, not a defender as mentioned in the summary.\n2. The article mentions that Sidwell's contract is due to expire at the end of the campaign and that he is hoping to sign a new deal. It does not confirm that a new contract has been signed.\n3. The article does not specify the length of any potential new contract, whereas the summary claims it is a three-year contract.\n4. The article indicates that Sidwell is still in discussions about a new deal and hopes to \"thrash it out\" so that it can be done. This implies that at the time of the article, the contract had not yet been finalized.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states Sidwell's position, asserts that a new contract has been signed, and specifies the duration of the contract, none of which is supported by the information in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
