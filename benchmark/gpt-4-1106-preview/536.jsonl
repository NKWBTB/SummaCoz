The article mentions a person named \"Wright,\" but does not provide a first name. The summary refers to \"Peter Wright,\" which is not a name mentioned in the article. This inconsistency suggests that the summary may be referring to a different individual or incorrectly stating the name.\n\n2. The article states that Wright is potentially buying 20% of the club and will become a club director according to The Sun. The summary, however, says that Wright is \"set to take over,\" which implies a complete or majority control of the club. This is not supported by the article, which only mentions a 20% acquisition.\n\n3. The article does not mention anyone named \"Peter Wright\" as a reality TV star. It does, however, refer to Wright as a runner-up in \"I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here\" in 2011 and notes his history of playing non-league football. The summary's reference to a \"celebrity reality tv star\" is consistent with the article, but the name \"Peter Wright\" is not.\n\n4. The article does not indicate that Wright is replacing anyone named \"Timericayericay Town.\" The summary seems to have a typographical error or a misinterpretation of the club's name, which is \"Billericay Town.\" There is no mention of a person with a similar name to \"Timericayericay\" being replaced by Wright.\n\n5. The article mentions that Billericay Town has been taken over by Glenn Tamplin, not the individual named Wright. The summary incorrectly suggests that Wright is taking over the club, which contradicts the information provided in the article.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article. The incorrect name \"Peter Wright,\" the implication of a takeover rather than a partial acquisition, and the typographical error/misinterpretation of the club's name are all inconsistencies.\n\nAnswer: No"}
