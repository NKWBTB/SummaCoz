Both the article and the summary are about a football player who has played for England.\n\nStep 2: Check the details provided in the summary against the article. The summary states that Adam Milner, a former England midfielder, has announced his retirement from international football.\n\nStep 3: Verify the name and the event. The article does not mention anyone named Adam Milner. Instead, it refers to a \"former Manchester City man\" and later uses the pronoun \"he,\" but the name is not given in the provided article excerpt. Therefore, we cannot confirm if the player mentioned in the article is indeed Adam Milner.\n\nStep 4: Look for information about retirement. The article does not explicitly state that the player has announced his retirement from international football. However, it does quote the player saying, \"The decision we've reached is about common sense,\" which could imply a decision related to his career, but without further context, we cannot be certain it refers to retirement.\n\nStep 5: Check for any inconsistencies. Since the article does not confirm the name of the player as Adam Milner or explicitly state that he has retired from international football, the summary contains information that is not supported by the article.\n\nBased on these steps, the answer is no; the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article because it mentions a name that is not provided in the article, and it assumes retirement which is not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt."}
