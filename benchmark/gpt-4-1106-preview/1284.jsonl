The summary correctly identifies the location of the incident as a school in Bangalore.\n\nStep 2: The article mentions that an 18-year-old named Gautami was shot in the head and does not specify her survival status. The summary states that a 19-year-old student was shot dead. There is a discrepancy in the age and the certainty of the student's death is not confirmed in the article.\n\nStep 3: The article does not provide any information about the age of the second victim, Sirisha, who was also shot but is believed to be out of danger. The summary does not mention this second victim.\n\nStep 4: The article does not specify the gender of the student who was shot dead, while the summary assumes the student to be male by using the pronoun \"a 19-year-old Indian student.\"\n\nStep 5: The article provides additional context about the rarity of gun crime at schools in India, the arrest of the alleged gunman, and a past incident from 2007. The summary does not include any of this information, but it is not required to for consistency.\n\nBased on the steps above, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the age of the victim and does not confirm the death of the student as the article does not explicitly state that the student was killed.
