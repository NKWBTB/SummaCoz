The article discusses Clive Weatherhogg's actions, which include coercing a woman into sexual activity and intercourse with another man, filming them, and sending sexually explicit material to the victim's sister. The charges and sentences in the article are related to Clive Weatherhogg's actions, not those of a 15-year-old girl.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary' statement is not mentioned in the article.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses a man named Clive Weatherhogg who was found guilty of coercing a woman to engage in sexual activity and intercourse with another man, which he arranged and filmed.\n\n2. The article mentions that Weatherhogg sent a sexually explicit clip to the victim's sister on Christmas Day and that he was placed on the sex offenders register.\n\n3. Weatherhogg was 42 years old at the time of the trial, and the offenses occurred between September 2013 and September 2014.\n\n4. The article specifies that the case was remitted to the High Court in Edinburgh due to its greater sentencing powers, indicating the severity of the crimes.\n\n5. The woman involved in the case felt \"blackmailed\" by Weatherhogg, according to her testimony during the trial.\n\n6. The article does not mention the age of the victim, nor does it specify that the victim was a 15-year-old girl.\n\n7. The summary claims that a man has been jailed for sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in Dundee, but the article does not provide any information about the victim being 15 years old or specifically mention sexual abuse directed at a 15-year-old girl.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces the specific age of the victim (15 years old) and the location (Dundee) which are not mentioned in the article. The article does not support the claim that the victim was a 15-year-old girl, nor does it specify that the abuse occurred in Dundee.\n\nAnswer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
