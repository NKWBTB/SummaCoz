{"document": "Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January . A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the\u00a0Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts . Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'", "claim": "kaitlyn granado , 24 , was first arrested on march 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with pupil . she had sex with an underage pupil from a texas high school . she has been accused of having sex with a 15-year-old student . she was arrested for letting another teen touch her breasts in april last year . the abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship with the 15-year-old . the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on march 24 .", "label": 0, "model_name": "M11", "cnndm_id": "dm-test-8e6c8aec6808f66ed0342e128a4e146f3ecd627d", "cut": "val", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "summeval", "origin": "cnndm", "error_type": "error", "doc_sents": ["Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January .", "A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts.", "Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail.", "Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year.", "According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas.", "The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month.", "She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the\u00a0Dallas Morning News.", "She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials.", "At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her.", "A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved.", "'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.'", "Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts .", "Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail.", "It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her.", "A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action.", "'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'"], "sum_sents": ["kaitlyn granado , 24 , was first arrested on march 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with pupil .", "she had sex with an underage pupil from a texas high school .", "she has been accused of having sex with a 15-year-old student .", "she was arrested for letting another teen touch her breasts in april last year .", "the abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship with the 15-year-old .", "the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on march 24 ."], "rel_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8], "cot": "1.

The article confirms this information, stating she was arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student.\n\n2. The summary mentions that she had sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school. The article supports this by detailing that she was accused of having sex with a 15-year-old student.\n\n3. The summary notes that she has been accused of having sex with a 15-year-old student. This is consistent with the article's information.\n\n4. The summary indicates that she was arrested for letting another teen touch her breasts in April last year. The article confirms that she admitted to kissing a pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year.\n\n5. The summary states that the abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship with the 15-year-old. The article corroborates this, explaining that the abuse was discovered after a school police officer learned of a potential relationship.\n\n6. The summary claims that the teen says the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on March 24.

This is a discrepancy between the summary and the article.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article due to the incorrect date provided for when the sexual relationship allegedly took place.\n\nAnswer: No"}
