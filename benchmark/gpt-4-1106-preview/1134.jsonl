This suggests that the summary's use of \"bomb\" is consistent with the article's description of the device.\n\nStep 3: The article does not specify the name of the street where the device was found during the incident described. However, it does mention \"Matilda Street\" in the context of roads being sealed off due to the discovery. This implies that the device was found in or near Matilda Street, which is consistent with the summary's mention of \"a street in Sheffield.\"\n\nStep 4: The article does not contradict any information presented in the summary. The summary is a simplified version of the events described in the article, focusing on the key point of a World War Two munition being found.\n\nBased on these steps, the summary is consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: Yes"}
