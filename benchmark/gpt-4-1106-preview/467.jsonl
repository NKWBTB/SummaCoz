The article does not explicitly mention that an investigation has been launched; it only states that the cause of the fire remains undetermined. However, given that the cause is undetermined, it is reasonable to infer that some form of investigation is likely to be underway or will be initiated to determine the cause of the fire.\n\nBased on the information provided in the article, the summary does not contradict any of the details, but it does introduce the idea of an \"investigation\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the article. The summary's statement could be seen as a reasonable assumption rather than a confirmed fact from the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces information (the launch of an investigation) that is not explicitly supported by the article."}
