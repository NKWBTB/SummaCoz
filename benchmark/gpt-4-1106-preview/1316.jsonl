The article mentions that the offices of Yeni Safak and Yeni Akit were attacked, but it does not specify that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made any statement about the fire.\n\n2. The article states that the attacks occurred in Istanbul, but it does not refer to Istanbul as the capital of Turkey. In fact, Ankara is the capital of Turkey, not Istanbul.\n\n3. The summary mentions a fire, and the article does confirm that there was a blaze at the Yeni Safak building which firefighters extinguished.\n\n4. The summary does not include any information about the attacks being carried out by masked assailants, the shattering of windows, the finding of spent bullet casings, or the fact that no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n5. The summary fails to mention that the two newspapers support the governing AK Party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which is a relevant detail provided in the article.\n\nBased on the above reasoning:\n\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article. It inaccurately attributes a statement to President Erdogan that is not mentioned in the article, incorrectly identifies Istanbul as the capital, and omits several key details from the original article."}
