The summary mentions \"on the eve of the UK's vote to leave the European Union,\" which implies that the article is discussing the period just before the Brexit vote. The article does indeed discuss the context of the UK's EU referendum, as it mentions expats voting and their opinions on the matter.\n\n2. The summary refers to \"the EU's second black country is in the UK.\" This statement is confusing and unclear. The term \"black country\" historically refers to a region in the West Midlands of England, known for its industrial past. The term is not used in the article, and there is no mention of any \"second black country\" or any context that would give meaning to this phrase in relation to the EU or the UK.\n\n3. The article discusses the perspectives of British expats living in Spain regarding the UK's EU referendum. It mentions their concerns about the potential impacts of Brexit on their lives, such as the status of their pensions and healthcare. The article also includes opinions from individuals who are either for \"Remain\" or \"Leave.\" None of this is reflected in the summary.\n\n4. The summary does not capture any specific details or the essence of the article. It fails to mention the expats' views on immigration, the potential financial implications of Brexit for them, or the cultural aspects of the British expat community in Spain.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. It contains a confusing and unsupported statement about \"the EU's second black country\" and fails to accurately represent the content of the article, which focuses on British expats in Spain and their views on the Brexit vote.\n\nAnswer: No"}
