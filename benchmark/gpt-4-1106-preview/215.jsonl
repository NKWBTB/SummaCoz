Dozens more hounds emerge from a stand of trees and bound across a field in search of a fox's scent. Horses carrying riders in red and black coats follow from a ways behind, quickly disappearing again over a hillcrest, minutes away from Baltimore's growing suburbs. The Elkridge-Harford Hunt Club has roots dating back to 1878, but records show organized foxhunts took place in Maryland as early as the 1790s.

The summary states that the Elkridge-Harford Hunt Club has roots dating back to 1878. This is consistent with the article, which mentions the same fact.\n\n2. The summary mentions that the club has managed to protect land that is larger than Manhattan. The article confirms this by stating that the club has protected a patchwork of land larger than Manhattan.\n\n3. The summary notes that there are nearly 160 organized foxhunting clubs in the U.S. and Canada. This information is also provided in the article, which cites the website of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America.\n\n4. The summary claims that the American hunt is a ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns. This statement is misleading. The article discusses that the sport's ban in Britain over animal welfare concerns is still debated, but it does not say that the American hunt is banned. Instead, it implies that the American version of the hunt is different, as it is a chase with the intent not to kill the fox.\n\n5. The summary correctly states that horses carrying riders in red and black coats follow from ways behind, which is supported by the article's description of the scene during a fox hunt.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, except for the misleading statement about the American hunt being banned in Britain. The correct interpretation is that the ban is a topic of debate in Britain, not that the American hunt itself is banned.\n\nFinal answer: No, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article due to the incorrect statement regarding the ban of the American hunt in Britain."}
