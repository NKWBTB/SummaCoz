The article discusses a Queen's Park Rangers player who made his Northern Ireland (NI) debut and scored in his second game.

The article mentions Michael O'Neill as the Northern Ireland manager, not a player or striker.\n\n2. The article does not mention anything about the player being the team's all-time leading goalscorer.

The article does mention that the player feels lucky and fortunate, which aligns with the summary's use of the word \"lucky.\" However, this is a minor point and does not address the main inconsistencies.\n\n4.

There is no mention of a player named Michael O'Neill being a striker or a player at all.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly identifies Michael O'Neill as a player and the team's all-time leading goalscorer, which is not supported by the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
