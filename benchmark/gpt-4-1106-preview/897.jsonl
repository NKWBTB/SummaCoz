The article states that Conor McGregor is gearing up for a featherweight title challenge against Jose Aldo on July 11 and has unveiled a new tattoo of a tiger's face on his stomach. The summary is consistent with this information.\n\n2. The article mentions that McGregor has a tattoo of a gorilla eating a heart on his chest, which is also mentioned in the summary. This is consistent.\n\n3. The article includes a quote from McGregor's Instagram post about the tiger tattoo, which is referenced in the summary. This is consistent.\n\n4. The article discusses McGregor's motivation for the upcoming fight, stating that he claimed Aldo lacks the same motivation as him and that McGregor wants the title more. The summary, however, incorrectly states that \"McGregor claims he has no motivation to win the title in Las Vegas on July 11.\" This is inconsistent with the article, which portrays McGregor as highly motivated and eager to win the title.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents McGregor's motivation for the upcoming fight.\n\nAnswer: No"}
