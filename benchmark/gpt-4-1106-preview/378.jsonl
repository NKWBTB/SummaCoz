Those are just a few of the stories that trended this week. 1. 'Star Wars' streaming . The Force is with the streaming device of your choice, thanks to this week's surprise announcement that the entire \"Star Wars\" saga (so far, anyway) would be released on digital HD at the end of the week. Between this and the release of \"Daredevil,\"  we imagine lots of nerds called in sick on Friday. 2. Mindy Kaling's brother: I faked being black to get into medical school . Actress Mindy Kaling's brother says that he posed as a black man years ago to get into medical school and that the experience opened his eyes to what he calls the hypocrisy of affirmative action. Among those who disapprove of the book he's planning to write about the whole thing: his sister. 3. Farewell, Rosco . \"Dukes of Hazzard\" fans mourned the loss of actor James Best, best known as Hazzard County's hapless sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, this week. Others who passed on: \"L.A. Law\" actor Richard Dysart and frequent Clint Eastwood co-star Geoffrey Lewis. 4. When Burger met King, it was love .

Not since Zayn Malik announced that he was quitting One Direction has Twitter had such a meltdown: \"Vampire Diaries\" star Nina Dobrev is leaving the CW series. \"Nothing will be the same again,\" one fan tweeted. Other things we loved: . More than 10 million people have seen Anne Hathaway's take on Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball,\" complete with props, from Spike's hit show \"Lip Sync Battle.\" Go, greased lightning! \"Late Late Show\" host and Tony winner James Corden put on \"Grease\" for Los Angeles drivers waiting in traffic. The cast of the movie \"Suicide Squad,\" including Will Smith and Margot Robbie, assembled for the first time this week in a Twitter photo from director David Ayer. And no worries, future Joker Jared Leto was taking the photo (in an image inspired by classic comic book \"The Killing Joke\").
