{"document": "An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter. Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama\u2019s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at \u2018the world at large\u2019. Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated. Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out \u2018blindly\u2019. \u2018He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch,\u2019 Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama. \u2018He didn't see it connect but he felt it connect.\u2019 The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11pm on Thursday night. Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music. Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday. The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport, aherre to a curfew from 6pm to 2am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week. Pama, who has no history of violence, was reportedly \u2018beside himself\u2019 with grief. The case is due to return to court on May 18.", "claim": "a single punch in the head of phillip UNK , 28 , was shot by a single punch in the head . he was reportedly in his yard on muller road with a single punch .

However, the article states that Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, not \"Phillip UNK.\" The summary introduces an incorrect name for Phillip Pama as \"Phillip UNK.\"\n3.

The summary states that \"a single punch in the head of Phillip UNK, 28, was shot by a single punch in the head.\" This statement is confusing and contains errors. The article mentions that Phillip Pama, 28, was the one who allegedly delivered a single punch, not the one who was punched. Additionally, the use of the word \"shot\" is incorrect as the article does not mention any shooting; it was a physical altercation involving a punch.\n\n2. The summary repeats the phrase \"with a single punch\" multiple times in a way that does not make sense and does not accurately reflect the content of the article.\n\n3. The summary refers to someone being \"in his yard on Muller Road\" but does not clarify who this person is. The article states that it was Leon Yeaman who was in his yard making noise.\n\n4. The summary uses the placeholder \"UNK\" multiple times, which seems to indicate missing or unknown information. This does not provide a clear or accurate representation of the events described in the article.\n\n5. The summary mentions \"Mr UNK said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out.\" This is a partial and inaccurate representation of the defense lawyer's statement. The article specifies that the lawyer's name is Bruce Peters and provides more context about the circumstances of the punch.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article as it contains inaccuracies, unclear references, and does not accurately convey the events or the individuals involved.\n\nAnswer: No"}
