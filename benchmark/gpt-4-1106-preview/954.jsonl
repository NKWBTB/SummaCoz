{"document": "There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity\u00a0in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action. \u00a0Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans.

There was no mention of Doncaster Rovers being beaten.\n\nStep 2: The summary mentions \"Fleetwood tested the patience of the most fan fan.\" The article does mention that the match \"tested the patience of the most ardent fan,\" so this part is consistent, although the summary has a repetition error with \"fan fan.\"\n\nStep 3: The summary says \"Doncaster's media team faced with sticking up the match highlights of the game highlights of 0-0 draw at Doncaster.\" The article does mention that Doncaster's media team faced a challenge compiling the match highlights due to the lack of action in the 0-0 draw. However, the wording in the summary is somewhat redundant and awkward but still conveys a similar message to the article.\n\nStep 4: The summary does not mention the humorously short highlight video that the media team created, which is a significant point in the article. This omission means the summary does not fully capture the essence of the article.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the outcome of the match and omits key details about the highlight video.\n\nAnswer: No"}
