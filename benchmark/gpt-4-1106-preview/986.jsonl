The summary states \"patrick kluivert has been winning start in world cup qualifiers\" which is consistent with the article's statement \"Patrick Kluivert has made a winning start in World Cup qualifying as coach of Curacao.\"\n\n2. The summary mentions \"the caribbean island team advanced to the second qualifying round in concacaf\" which aligns with the article's information that Curacao advanced to the second qualifying round in CONCACAF.\n\n3. The summary indicates \"patrick kluivert 's team won 4-3 on aggregate at montserrat to win\" which is supported by the article's detail that Curacao won 4-3 on aggregate after a 2-2 draw in the second-leg match.\n\n4. The summary's statement \"the holland face 2-2 in a second-leg match at montserrat\" is inconsistent and confusing. The article does not mention \"Holland\" facing a 2-2 match; it is Curacao that played the match and drew 2-2. The use of \"Holland\" here is incorrect and misleading, as the article is discussing Curacao's team, not Holland's.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, but the last statement introduces an inconsistency by incorrectly referencing \"Holland\" instead of Curacao. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNo, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article."}
