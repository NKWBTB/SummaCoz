The article does mention the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh as one of the places Jak stayed during his treatment, but it does not confirm that this is where he passed away.\n\nStep 3: Look for mentions of tributes paid by the family.\nThe article does not detail any tributes paid by the family in a hospital setting. It does mention his mother's message on Facebook, which could be considered a tribute, but it does not specify the location as being in a hospital in Edinburgh.\n\nStep 4: Assess the consistency of the summary with the article.\nThe summary states that the family paid tribute to him after he died in a hospital in Edinburgh. The article does not confirm the location of his death or that the family paid tribute in the hospital.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article because it implies that the teenager died in a hospital in Edinburgh and that the family paid tribute to him there, neither of which is supported by the information provided in the article."}
