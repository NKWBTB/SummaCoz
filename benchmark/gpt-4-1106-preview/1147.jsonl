The article discusses Fosse Park, which is located near junction 21 of the M1 and was bought in August for \u00a3345.5m. The summary does not mention Fosse Park or its location.\n\n2. The article mentions that plans are being prepared to improve parking and traffic congestion, as well as the appearance of units. However, it does not specify the number of new parking units needed. The summary claims that more than 100 new parking units are needed, which is a detail not provided in the article.\n\n3. The article specifies that the park is a gateway from Blaby into the city, and the new owners see it as an investment opportunity. The summary does not mention this aspect or the perspective of the new owners.\n\n4. The article quotes Ernie White, leader of Blaby District Council, and Paul Clarke, director of investments at Crown Estates, discussing the improvements and their concerns. The summary does not reference any of these individuals or their statements.\n\n5. The article does not mention West Yorkshire, while the summary states that the park is in West Yorkshire. This is a discrepancy in location, as the article implies that Fosse Park is near the city of Blaby, which is in Leicestershire, not West Yorkshire.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it introduces details not present in the article (the specific number of parking units needed), it fails to mention the actual park in question (Fosse Park), and it incorrectly identifies the location of the park as being in West Yorkshire.\n\nAnswer: No"}
