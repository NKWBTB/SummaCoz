The article discusses the implications of Brexit on the UK fishing industry and the potential need to negotiate with the EU regarding fishing rights and market access.\n\n2. The House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that examines the risks and opportunities for the UK fishing industry post-Brexit.\n\n3. The report suggests that certain elements of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) should be retained and that the UK should continue to base total allowable catches and quotas on scientific advice.\n\n4. The report also mentions the potential complications that could arise if the UK leaves the CFP framework, such as the possibility of having four different fisheries management regimes in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.\n\n5. The article quotes Lord Teverson, who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee, discussing trade-offs and the possibility that EU member states may demand access to UK waters in exchange for tariff-free market access.\n\n6. The article does not state that the UK's fisheries policy should be devolved to the European Union. Instead, it discusses how the UK might negotiate with the EU to determine the future of its fisheries policy post-Brexit.\n\n7. The summary's claim that the UK's fisheries policy should be devolved to the European Union is not supported by the article. The article does not suggest that control of the UK's fisheries policy should be handed over to the EU; rather, it discusses the need for negotiation and potential trade-offs.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article."}
