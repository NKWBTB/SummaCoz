The summary also refers to the mother of a boy, which is consistent with the article.\n\nStep 2: The article does not specify Charlie's age, only that he has been ill since the age of three. The summary states that the boy is three years old, which could be interpreted as inconsistent if Charlie is no longer three. However, without a clear statement of his current age in the article, we cannot definitively say this is inconsistent.\n\nStep 3: The article does not mention brain cancer specifically; it only refers to the need for T-Cell Therapy after a failed transplant. The summary's mention of a \"rare form of brain cancer\" introduces information not present in the article, which is inconsistent.\n\nStep 4: The article states that an anonymous donor paid for Charlie's treatment, and the parents are grateful for this generosity. The summary incorrectly states that the mother paid for a \u00a32,000 donation. This is inconsistent with the article, which clearly indicates that the donor is not the mother and does not specify the amount donated.\n\nStep 5: The article does not mention any specific amount related to the donation or the cost of the treatment. The summary introduces a specific figure (\u00a32,000), which is not supported by the article.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary introduces details not present in the article (specifically the mention of brain cancer and the \u00a32,000 donation by the mother), which makes it inconsistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
