{"document": "Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus has revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Speaking in the latest issue of\u00a0Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former\u00a0senator\u00a0and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld.

However, the article does not state that Julia Louis-Dreyfus was inspired by Hillary Clinton's hairstyle for her character in Veep. The article mentions that Julia discussed Hillary Clinton's scrutiny over her hairstyles but does not link it to Julia Louis-Dreyfus' hairstyle in Veep. Additionally, the article does not provide specific details about Hillary's hair scrutiny since 1993.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary suggests a direct connection between Julia Louis-Dreyfus' hairstyle inspiration and Hillary Clinton's hair scrutiny over the years, while the article does not make this explicit connection.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step 1: The summary states that Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine.

This is also consistent with the article, which confirms her role in the show \"Veep.\"\n\nStep 3: The summary states that Julia was inspired by none other than Hillary Clinton. The article supports this by explaining that Julia's ultra-short hairstyle in the newest season of \"Veep\" was inspired by Hillary Clinton.\n\nStep 4: The summary includes a fragmented and unclear sentence: \"hillary 's hair has been it as us president for first time in 1993.\" This sentence seems to be an error or a misinterpretation. The article discusses the scrutiny Hillary Clinton's hair has faced since her husband, Bill Clinton, was elected US President in 1993, but it does not say \"Hillary's hair has been it as US president for first time in 1993.\" This part of the summary is not consistent with the article and is also factually incorrect as Hillary Clinton has never been the US President.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is mostly consistent with the article, except for the last fragmented sentence, which is both inconsistent and factually incorrect. Therefore, the answer is no, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article."}
