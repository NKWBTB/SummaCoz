The summary correctly states that digital information will be available at the festival. However, the summary is not entirely accurate because it suggests that this feature is for \"next year's\" festival, while the article indicates that the feature will be available for this year's festival, with specific dates provided. Additionally, the summary does not capture the full scope of the digital offerings, such as the augmented reality experience and the ability for people around the world to interact with the festival.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly refers to the festival as \"next year's\" when the article is discussing this year's festival."}
