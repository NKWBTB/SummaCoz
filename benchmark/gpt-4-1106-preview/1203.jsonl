The article discusses bottles washing up on Poldhu Cove and other nearby coves on the Lizard peninsula, not a container ship itself.\n2.

The article mentions that the National Trust believes a container went overboard from a ship during stormy weather, but it does not say that the ship itself washed up on the beach.\n4. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency confirms that the MV Blue Ocean lost a container, but there is no evidence directly linking the bottles on the Cornish coast to this incident.\n5. There is no mention in the article of any fatalities or injuries related to the incident.
