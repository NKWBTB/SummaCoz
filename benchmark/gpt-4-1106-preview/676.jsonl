The article mentions that the Commonwealth Games are scheduled for April, and Muir's exams are in May, making it impossible for her to attend the Games.

The article also mentions that Muir is considering the World Indoor Championships in March as a potential target, which is not mentioned in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that Muir is targeting the Commonwealth Games and introduces information about the Glasgow Indoor Grand Prix that is not present in the article.\n\nAnswer: No"}
