The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video . A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream. He said he was 'shocked' and 'didn't\u00a0understand how the parents let the kid' go over the railing and into the pit .

The summary states that the toddler slipped and fell into a cheetah exhibit at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, which is consistent with the article's information.\n\n2.

The article also states that the mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the exhibit.\n\n4. The summary claims that the baby boy was airlifted to the hospital. However, the article does not mention the child being airlifted; it simply states that he was taken to the hospital. This is a discrepancy.\n\n5. The summary correctly notes that the child suffered minor injuries in the fall and was not attacked by the animals, which is supported by the article.\n\n6. The summary says that the zoo stated the boy was not approached by the cheetahs because they were frightened. The article suggests that a zoo visitor, Terra Lurie, believes the cheetahs were frightened and therefore did not approach the boy. This is a slight misrepresentation of the source, as it was a visitor's belief, not an official statement from the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not entirely consistent with the article due to the incorrect claim that the child was airlifted to the hospital and the misrepresentation of the reason the cheetahs did not approach the boy as an official statement from the zoo."}
