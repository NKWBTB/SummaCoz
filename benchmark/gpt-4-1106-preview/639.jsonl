There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.\"The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\"", "claim": "the scottish government has been accused of \" unfairly unfair \" by a watchdog after a report found that a council tax system was not stored.", "label": 0, "cut": "val", "hash": "33811105", "model_name": "TranS2S", "annotations": [0, 0, 0], "dataset": "frank", "origin": "xsum", "error_type": "OutE", "doc_sents": ["Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this", "linkA", "review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the system.", "It said the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.", "The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.", "Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.", "He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \"good tax\" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.", "But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.", "Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.", "Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.", "But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated.", "There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.", "He said:  \"It is clear there is no magic bullet.", "\"Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.\"So", "whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.", "\"The", "commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.", "A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\".", "He added: \"That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.", "\"The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.\""], "sum_sents": ["the scottish government has been accused of \" unfairly unfair \" by a watchdog after a report found that a council tax system was not stored."], "rel_index": [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 17], "cot": "1.

The summary states that the Scottish government has been accused of being \"unfairly unfair\" by a watchdog after a report found that a council tax system was not stored.\n2.

The article discusses a review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which mentions that there is no \"magic bullet\" to cure defects in the council tax system. This suggests that the system has problems, but it does not indicate an accusation of unfairness directed specifically at the Scottish government by a watchdog.\n\n2. The article states that the council tax had built-in problems \"from day one\" and that a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policymakers. This indicates recognition of issues with the system but does not frame it as an accusation against the Scottish government.\n\n3. The article mentions that the commission was set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla and that it will report back later in the year. This shows that the government is involved in addressing the issue, rather than being accused of creating it.\n\n4. The article quotes a Scottish government spokesman saying that ministers consider the current council tax system \"as a whole to be unfair\" and that they are looking into fairer alternatives. This is an acknowledgment of the system's unfairness from the government itself, not an accusation from an external watchdog.\n\n5. The summary states that the Scottish government has been accused of being \"unfairly unfair\" by a watchdog. This statement is not supported by the article, as the article does not mention any watchdog accusing the Scottish government. Instead, it discusses the government's own acknowledgment of the council tax system's unfairness and their efforts to reform it.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the corresponding article. The summary incorrectly suggests that a watchdog accused the Scottish government of unfairness, which is not supported by the information in the article."}
