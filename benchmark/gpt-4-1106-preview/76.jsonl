Australia all-rounder James Faulkner won't be surprised if there's some niggle and verbal exchanges, just like he's not surprised that defending champion India shook off their poor form leading into the World Cup to win seven consecutive matches. 'They've spent a fair bit of time in the country, so they've adapted well to the conditions,' Faulkner told a news conference Monday. 'It's no surprise they're up against us in the semi-final, they're a very strong team. Australian cricketer James Faulkner fields a ball off his own bowling at the Bellerive Oval during the World Cup . Australian Faulkner bowls during the 2015 Cricket World Cup match against Scotland at the Bellerive Oval . 'You're going to see two very good teams going up against each other - it should be a very good spectacle.' Australia have won the Cricket World Cup four times and reached the final on two other occasions, but never on home soil. India have two World Cup titles, and became the first team to clinch it at home in 2011 after beating Australia in the quarter-finals, Pakistan in the semi-finals and Sri Lanka in the championship match. Watson bats during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match between Australian and Pakistan at Adelaide Oval . India didn't win a competitive match between the time the squad landed in Australia in November until its opening World Cup game against Pakistan on February 15. In that time, it lost a test series to Australia, and was winless in a limited-overs tri-series against Australia and England. There was some glaring aggression between the teams in the test and ODI series, with players on both sides sanctioned and warned that sledging would not be tolerated at the World Cup. All-rounder Shane Watson was fined last week for his part in an exchange with Pakistan paceman Wahab Riaz . Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was fined last week for his part in an exchange with Pakistan paceman Wahab Riaz during a torrid spell of fast, short-pitch bowling that was easily the highlight of the quarterfinal in Adelaide. Faulkner said that exchange was 'all in great spirit,' and he expected more spirited exchanges with a spot in the final at stake at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. 'There's going to be words said and it's going to be a really tough contest,' Faulkner said, adding that there's usually some sledging on the field. 'It's the nature of the game, it's a semi-final. Cut throat. Neither team will be backing down.' Watson plays a short pitched ball from Riaz of Pakistan during the  World Cup match at the Adelaide Oval . The India squad practiced at the SCG on Monday but, as have become the usual routine at the World Cup, remained off limits to the media until the eve of the match. The Sydney venue is expected to be packed with traveling India fans who may outnumber Australia supporters and possibly make it seem more like an away game for the locals. 'We were talking about it last night at dinner, the last game we played here it definitely felt like that,' Faulkner said.
