The summary states that \"Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu insists the La Liga leaders have no plans to replace Luis Enrique.\" This is consistent with the article, which mentions Bartomeu refuting claims about replacing Enrique and expressing happiness with his performance.\n\n2. The summary mentions that \"the 44-year-old took charge of the club last summer, signing a two-year-deal.\" This is consistent with the article, which states that Enrique took charge last summer and has a contract until 2016.\n\n3. The summary includes a statement that \"the Barcelona president is only six games away from winning the title.\" This is a misrepresentation. The article states that the team, under Enrique's management, is six games away from winning the title, not the president himself.\n\n4. The summary correctly notes that \"Luis Suarez scored the scoring for Barcelona after just one minute against Valencia.\" The article confirms that Suarez opened the scoring for Barcelona.\n\n5. The summary includes a statement that \"Suarez has been replaced in the summer.\" This statement is not supported by the article. The article does not mention any plans to replace Suarez. It seems to be a confusion with the earlier part of the summary discussing Luis Enrique, not Luis Suarez.\n\n6. The summary ends with \"the Barca president says the club are 'very happy' with him.\" This is consistent with the article, which quotes Bartomeu saying they are very happy with Enrique's performance.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNo, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the Barcelona president is close to winning the title, which is a role attributed to the team and its manager, and it falsely claims that Suarez has been replaced in the summer, which is not mentioned anywhere in the article."}
