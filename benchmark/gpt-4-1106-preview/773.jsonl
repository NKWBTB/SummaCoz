{"document": "Four burly Swedish cops put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty on a Manhattan subway train last night. The friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We\u2019ve been here one day. We\u2019re no heroes, just tourists,'\u00a0Makrus \u00c5sberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the\u00a0New York Post. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik N\u00e4slund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus \u00c5sberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said. When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Mis\u00e9rables.

The summary implies that the Swedish cops, who were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables on Broadway, put their New York City vacation on hold to answer the call of duty and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a Manhattan subway train.\n2.

They then sprang into action to stop the assault. The summary incorrectly suggests that the assault occurred after the friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n3. The inconsistency is due to the error that the summary incorrectly implies the timing of the assault, suggesting it happened while the friends were on their way to see Les Mis\u00e9rables, while the article states that they were already on the subway train when they intervened.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The summary states that the friends were on their way to see \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" on Broadway, which is consistent with the article's information.\n\n2. The summary mentions that they rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a Manhattan subway train last night, which aligns with the article's description of the incident.\n\n3. The summary quotes Makrus \u00c5sberg, Samuel Kvarzell, and Eric Jansberger as saying they were \"no heroes,\" which is consistent with the sentiment expressed in the article, although the article does not specifically attribute the quote to Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger.\n\n4. The summary correctly identifies the individuals as Swedish cops on vacation in New York City, which is supported by the article.\n\n5. The summary mentions that they put their vacation on hold to answer the call of duty, which is a fair interpretation of their actions as described in the article.\n\n6. The summary states that the train found the homeless man in the fight, which is a bit unclear and could be interpreted as the train itself finding the man. The article clarifies that it was the Swedish officers who found the homeless man attacking another rider when they responded to the conductor's call for police officers.\n\n7. The summary incorrectly states Samuel Kvarzell's age as 26, while the article states he is 25 years old.\n\n8. The summary does not mention the fourth friend, Erik N\u00e4slund, who was also involved in the incident.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is mostly consistent with the article but contains a couple of inaccuracies regarding Samuel Kvarzell's age and the omission of Erik N\u00e4slund.\n\nAnswer: No"}
