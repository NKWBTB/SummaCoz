The article discusses Tesco's decision to dispose of its loss-making US food chain, Fresh & Easy, and the details of the deal with Yucaipa.\n2. The article mentions that around 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees will transfer to the new business as part of the deal.\n3. Tesco's statement about an \"orderly and efficient exit from the US market\" is included in the article.\n4. The article provides information about the financial aspects of the deal, including the loan Tesco will provide to the new business and the cost to Tesco for disposing of the Fresh & Easy brand.\n5. The article identifies Yucaipa as the company taking over some of the Fresh & Easy stores and provides some background on Yucaipa and its owner, Ron Burkle.\n6. The article also mentions Tesco's financial performance, noting its first fall in annual profits for 20 years.\n\nNow, let's analyze the summary:\n\n- The summary mentions \"Tesco is looking to unveil its chief executive, Yulia Tesco,\" which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention any individual named Yulia Tesco, nor does it discuss unveiling a chief executive.\n- The summary includes \"chief executive of the supermarket chain, KSFA,\" which is not mentioned or supported by the article. The article does not reference KSFA, and it is unclear what KSFA refers to.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it contains information that is not present in the article, such as the mention of a chief executive named Yulia Tesco and a supermarket chain called KSFA.\n\nAnswer: No"}
