The summary mentions \"a pair of paralympian pistols,\" which is not supported by the article. The article does not mention anything about the competitors being Paralympians or pistols being involved in their identity.\n\n2. The summary states that they have \"set up a marathon on track,\" which is inconsistent with the article. The article does not mention anything about setting up a marathon. Instead, it talks about a specific event where competitors carry their partners over a 380-meter obstacle course.\n\n3. The summary claims the event is \"in a bid to break the world championships in Lithuania.\" This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the article does not mention anything about attempting to break world championships. Second, the event mentioned in the article is not taking place in Lithuania; it is Richard Blake-Smith and his partner Anna who will compete at the World Championships, which are to be held in Finland, not Lithuania.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nAnswer: No."}
