The article discusses an incident where a cat named Teenie was shot and injured, requiring amputation of its leg. The summary also mentions a cat being injured in a shooting.\n\n2. The Scottish SPCA is mentioned in the article as being involved in the case and urging for the licensing of airguns. The summary reflects this by stating that the Scottish SPCA has called for new rules on airguns.\n\n3. The article specifies that the incident took place in Winchburgh, not East Ayrshire. The summary incorrectly states the location of the incident as East Ayrshire.\n\n4. The article provides details about the cat's injuries, the owner's reaction, and the Scottish SPCA's stance on airgun licensing, as well as information about a consultation on airgun licensing by the Scottish government. The summary does not contradict these details but omits the specific location, the cat's name, and the owner's comments.\n\n5. The article does not mention any action taken by the Scottish SPCA following this specific incident other than urging for information and highlighting the need for airgun licensing. The summary's implication that the call for new rules is a direct response to this incident is not explicitly stated in the article but is consistent with the Scottish SPCA's general stance as described.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the location of the incident as East Ayrshire instead of Winchburgh."}
