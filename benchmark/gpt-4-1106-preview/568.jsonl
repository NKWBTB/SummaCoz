The article states that the victim was fatally injured outside a property on Daniel Hill Terrace, Upperthorpe, which is close to the city center. This contradicts the summary's claim that the man was shot dead in his home.\n\n2. The article mentions that the man was either in, or close to, a black Mercedes car he had been driving when he was shot. This detail is not present in the summary.\n\n3. The time of the incident is reported in the article as approximately 13:35 GMT, which is in the early afternoon, not the early hours of the morning as the summary suggests.\n\n4. The article does not specify that the shooting occurred inside the man's home; rather, it happened outside a property, which is inconsistent with the summary's claim.\n\n5. The article provides additional context about the victim being a member of a family who live close to the scene and that the shooting occurred during a family celebration. This information is not reflected in the summary.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains several inaccuracies regarding the location of the shooting, the time of the incident, and the circumstances of the event.\n\nAnswer: No"}
