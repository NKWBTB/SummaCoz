The article states that British Transport Police arrested a 22-year-old man from Birmingham on Wednesday. The summary also mentions the arrest of a man, but does not specify his age or the day of the week he was arrested.\n\n2. The article specifies that the arrest was in connection with the rape of a teenager in a vehicle in the Witton area at around 02:00 BST on 26 July. The summary mentions the rape of a 15-year-old girl but does not provide details about the location, time, or date of the incident.\n\n3. The article mentions that the girl had previously been raped at the railway station hours earlier, indicating that there were two separate incidents. The summary does not mention the first incident or that there were two separate attacks.\n\n4. The article discusses a man being charged and another man being arrested in connection with the first attack, treating it as a separate incident. The summary does not mention this detail.\n\n5. The article also mentions a Good Samaritan and a second vehicle, which are not referenced in the summary.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is partially consistent with the article. It correctly states that a man was arrested in connection with a rape in Birmingham. However, it lacks specific details about the age of the man, the timing of the arrest, the location and time of the incident, and the fact that there were two separate incidents. Additionally, the summary does not mention the first attack or the involvement of other individuals.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not fully consistent with the article because it omits several key details and does not fully capture the complexity of the situation described in the article."}
