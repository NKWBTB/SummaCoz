The article states that Amarmandakh Sukhbaatar, a Mongolian rapper, was performing in Ulan Bator when the alleged attack took place. The summary is consistent with this information regarding the location and the fact that the rapper was attacked.\n\n2. The article mentions that the rapper was hit over the head with a bottle and repeatedly kicked in the face. However, it does not say that he was beaten with a swastika. The summary incorrectly states that he was beaten with a swastika.\n\n3. The article indicates that the rapper is in a serious condition, as he spent about 10 days in a coma after the beating. The summary's claim that the rapper is in a critical condition in the hospital is consistent with the article's description of his serious injuries.\n\n4. The article explains that the swastika is a traditional symbol in Mongolia and that the rapper wore a robe embroidered with it, but it does not support the claim that the swastika was used as a weapon in the attack.\n\n5. The article does not provide any official statement saying that the rapper was beaten with a swastika, as the summary suggests.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states that the rapper was beaten with a swastika, which is not supported by the information in the article. The article describes the rapper being hit with a bottle and kicked, but there is no mention of a swastika being used as a weapon in the assault.\n\nAnswer: No"}
