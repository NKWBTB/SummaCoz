The inconsistency is due to the error in the summary, which implies an entirely different outcome of the case (being cleared) compared to the article, which focuses on the coroner's findings regarding the death and suspicions but doesn't mention any clearance of a Ukrainian millionaire.\nTherefore, the answer is no, the summary is not consistent with the article.", "gpt-4-1106-preview": "Step by Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The article discusses the death of Barry Pring, a 47-year-old man, who was killed by a speeding car in Kiev in 2008. The summary incorrectly refers to a \"Ukrainian millionaire\" when it was Barry Pring who died, and there is no indication in the article that he was a millionaire or that he was Ukrainian.\n\n2. The article states that Barry Pring's wife, Ganna Ziuzina, is suspected by his family of having some involvement in his death, which they believe was a staged hit and run accident. The summary incorrectly suggests that it was the wife who was killed.\n\n3. The article mentions that the coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and that there were suspicions regarding the wife's actions before and after Barry Pring's death. There is no mention of the wife being cleared of killing her husband.\n\n4. The article provides details about the investigation, the inquest, and the suspicions surrounding Ganna Ziuzina, including her attempts to claim her husband's assets and her alleged affair. The summary does not align with these details and instead presents a contradictory statement.\n\n5. The article does not mention any clearing of charges or exoneration of Ganna Ziuzina. Instead, it highlights the ongoing suspicions and the fact that the case is still active, although not actively pursued.\n\nConclusion:\nThe summary is not consistent with the article. It incorrectly identifies the victim as a Ukrainian millionaire and falsely claims that this person has been cleared of killing his wife, when in fact, the article is about the wife being suspected of involvement in her husband's death.\n\nAnswer: No"}
