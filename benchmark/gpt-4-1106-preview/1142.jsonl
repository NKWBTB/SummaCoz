The article states that Jackson, who is 22 years old, scored four goals in 36 appearances last season for Wrexham, not Barnsley. This contradicts the summary's claim that Jackson was signed from Barnsley.\n\n2. The article mentions that Jackson is Barnsley's third signing for the next season, which implies that Jackson is moving to Barnsley, not from Barnsley to Wrexham as the summary suggests.\n\n3. The article includes a quote from Barnsley's caretaker boss, Paul Heckingbottom, which indicates that Jackson is joining Barnsley and is expected to fit into their style of play.\n\n4. The article also notes that Jackson turned down a contract offer from Wrexham for the next season, further supporting that he is leaving Wrexham rather than joining them.\n\n5. There is no mention of the length of the deal or the fee involved in the article, which are details included in the summary.\n\nBased on the above points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the direction of the transfer (from Barnsley to Wrexham instead of Wrexham to Barnsley), the length of the deal, and the fee involved.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
