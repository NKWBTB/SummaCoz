The article confirms that a club was fined 100,000 dirhams, which is equivalent to \u00a37,170. This part of the summary is consistent with the article, although the exact amount is slightly off.\n\nStep 2: The summary states that fans threw flares. The article also mentions that fans threw flares, so this information is consistent.\n\nStep 3: The summary suggests that the incident took place at the team's stadium in London's Al. However, the article specifies that the events occurred at the Mohammed V stadium, with no mention of London. This indicates a discrepancy in the location.\n\nStep 4: The summary does not mention the specific teams involved, the outcome of the match, the number of arrests made, or the inquiry opened by prosecutors, all of which are detailed in the article. While these omissions do not necessarily make the summary inconsistent, they do leave out significant information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the summary is not consistent with the article because it incorrectly states the location of the incident as being in London when it actually took place at the Mohammed V stadium.
