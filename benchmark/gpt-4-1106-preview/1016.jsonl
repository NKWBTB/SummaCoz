The article begins by stating that Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC \"Syria is doing its best\" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. This indicates that Syria is attempting to meet its obligations, not failing to comply.\n\n2. It is mentioned that Syria missed a deadline to hand over its entire stockpile, which could imply a failure to meet a specific timeline. However, the reason given for the delay is an attack on a shipment of weapons, suggesting that the failure is not due to a lack of effort or intention to comply.\n\n3. Mr. Mekdad explains that the delay is due to security concerns, as shipments were attacked by \"terrorist groups.\" This further supports the idea that the compliance issue is related to external challenges rather than an unwillingness to comply.\n\n4. The article also includes statements from Mr. Mekdad and other sources that indicate Syria's commitment to fulfilling its obligations, such as \"Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council. We shall implement on time all our obligations.\"\n\n5. The summary states that Syria's government says it is \"failing to comply with the UN's deadline for the sale of chemical weapons.\" The article does not mention a \"sale\" of chemical weapons but rather the destruction and removal of the stockpile. Additionally, the government does not admit to failing; it suggests that it is facing challenges in meeting the deadline due to attacks and the ongoing war.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the summary is not consistent with the article because it misrepresents Syria's efforts and the nature of the compliance issue, and it incorrectly uses the term \"sale\" instead of destruction or removal of chemical weapons.\n\nAnswer: No"}
