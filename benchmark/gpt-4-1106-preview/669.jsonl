The summary implies that a prison in Essex is \"frightened\" after reports of people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n2. However, the article does not support this implication. While the article discusses issues related to contraband being thrown over the prison wall and the concerns of residents and former inmates, it does not mention the prison itself being \"frightened\" or people being thrown into the prison by drones.\n3.

The article mentions Chelmsford Prison and discusses the issue of packages being thrown over the prison walls. The summary incorrectly states that people were thrown into the prison, which is not supported by the article.\n\n2. The article does not mention anyone being \"frightened\" due to the incidents. Instead, it quotes a woman living near the prison saying she does not feel frightened but it's not nice, and she takes precautions like locking her doors.\n\n3. The article does mention the use of drones, but it specifically states that the former inmate claimed drones were used, while the Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence of drones coming into the Chelmsford site. The summary incorrectly suggests that the prison has reported drones being used.\n\n4. The location is correctly identified as Essex in the summary, which is consistent with the article.\n\nBased on these points, the summary is not consistent with the article because it contains inaccuracies regarding the nature of the incidents (people vs. packages) and the emotional response of the prison or its staff (frightened vs. not frightened). Additionally, it misrepresents the information about drones being used to throw items into the prison.\n\nAnswer: No, the summary is not consistent with the article."}
