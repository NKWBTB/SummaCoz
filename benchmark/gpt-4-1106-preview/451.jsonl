This indicates that he has played for Dundee, but it does not confirm the current transfer situation mentioned in the summary.\n\nStep 3: The article does not mention the duration of Clarkson's contract or agreement with St Mirren, so we cannot confirm that he has been signed until the end of the season as stated in the summary.\n\nStep 4: The summary names the player as \"Jeremy Clarkson,\" but the article does not mention his first name. Therefore, we cannot verify if \"Jeremy\" is indeed his first name or if it is an error.\n\nBased on these observations, the summary contains information that is not supported by the article: it assumes a loan from Dundee, specifies the duration of the contract, and potentially misnames the player. Therefore, the summary is not consistent with the article.\n\nNo."}
